  "text": "On Wednesday, July 30, 2025, Hawai‘i Police Department launched Versaterm CommunityConnect, a new technology program designed to keep residents, businesses, and visitors informed about both emergency and non-emergency police responses.\nWhen a community member contacts police dispatch to request assistance via a cell phone, CommunityConnect will send an automated text to acknowledge receipt of the call. In cases where there is a delay in officer response, callers may receive an additional text informing them of the delay. If a caller contacts police dispatch from a landline, the responding officer will provide them with a link to a victim portal, www.engage.hawaiipolice.gov , where they can register to receive updates on their case.\nTo ensure public safety, real-time updates will not be sent for in-progress incidents or situations where messaging could pose a risk to those involved.\nIn some cases, CommunityConnect will also send follow-up messages regarding the outcome of a case, such as whether an arrest was made or if the case was otherwise closed.\nIf the caller does not speak English, the automated messages can also be sent in Spanish and Tagalog.\nThe system is part of the department’s ongoing commitment to transparency and community engagement.\n“This technology will increase our communication and customer service with the Hawai‘i Island communities we serve,” said Acting Police Chief Reed Mahuna. “It’s similar to systems used by online retailers or global delivery companies and Hawai‘i Police Department is pleased to be the first county police department in the state to implement this technology.”\nFor more information, please go to our website, www.hawaiipolice.gov , or contact Major Sandor Finkey of Hawai‘i Police Department’s Technical Services Division at (808) 961-2265.",
