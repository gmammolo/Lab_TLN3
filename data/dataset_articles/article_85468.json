  "text": "OpenAI launched a new feature called Study Mode on ChatGPT on Tuesday. The tool is designed to help students engage in conversations that promote learning and deeper understanding. Study Mode has begun rolling out to users on the Free, Plus, Pro, and Team plans, and will soon be available on ChatGPT Edu.\nIn a rush? Here are the quick facts:\nOpenAI launched Study Mode for ChatGPT Users will be able to engage in interactive conversations that promote learning and deeper understanding. Study Mode has begun rolling out to users on the Free, Plus, Pro, and Team plans, and will soon be available on ChatGPT Edu. According to the official announcement , ChatGPT has become one of the main tools for learning across the world. However, concerns remain about whether or not students are truly understanding and processing the information they receive. Study mode aims to provide an interactive learning experience rather than simply delivering answers.\n“Instead of doing the work for them, study mode encourages students to think critically about their learning,” said Robbie Torney, Senior Director of AI Programs at Common Sense Media. “Features like these are a positive step toward effective AI use for learning. Even in the AI era, the best learning still happens when students are excited about and actively engaging with the lesson material.”\nAs ChatGPT becomes a go-to tool for students, we’re committed to ensuring it fosters deeper understanding and learning.\nIntroducing study mode in ChatGPT — a learning experience that helps you work through problems step-by-step instead of just getting an answer. pic.twitter.com/B8VbRYJH6r\n— OpenAI (@OpenAI) July 29, 2025\nOpenAI said it has been working with pedagogy experts, teachers and scientists to develop the tool, with a particular focus on college students.\nAmong its main features, OpenAI highlighted Socratic questioning—a methodology also used by Anthropic in its ‘Claude for Education’ program—which guides students toward active learning. Other features include personalized support tailored to the student’s level, knowledge quizzes, and progress tracking.\nOpenAI showed in short videos how study mode operates, like teaching a student about Game Theory and designing a learning guide, or helping another user with a homework on algorithms.\nThe company clarified that the feature has limitations and that they expect to gain more feedback to improve the learning tool.\nOpenAI is also working on an AI education project in the United States , align with Microsoft and Anthropic, to support educators across with AI training, and building a facility in New York.\nNext Story Did you enjoy this article?
