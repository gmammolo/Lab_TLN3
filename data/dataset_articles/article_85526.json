  "text": "Ethereum price found support near the $3,680 zone. ETH is now rising and might soon aim for a move toward the $4,000 zone.\nEthereum price started a downside correction from the $3,940 level, like Bitcoin. ETH price declined below the $3,900 and $3,800 support levels.\nThe bears even pushed the price below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,515 swing low to the $3,940 high. Finally, the price spiked below $3,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. It tested the $3,680 support zone.\nThe bulls protected the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,515 swing low to the $3,940 high. The price is again rising above the $3,750 level. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3,810 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.\nEthereum price is now trading above $3,820 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $3,880 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,920 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,940 level. A clear move above the $3,940 resistance might send the price toward the $3,980 resistance.\nAn upside break above the $3,980 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,050 resistance zone or even $4,120 in the near term.\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $3,880 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,800 level. The first major support sits near the $3,720 zone.\nA clear move below the $3,720 support might push the price toward the $3,680 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,565 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,500.\nTechnical Indicators\nHourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.\nMajor Support Level – $3,800\nMajor Resistance Level – $3,880",
