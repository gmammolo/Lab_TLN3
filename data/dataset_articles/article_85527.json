  "text": "Stellar (XLM) price trades within a bullish pennant pattern at $0.42 at the time of writing on Thursday, hinting at a potential bullish reversal. On-chain and derivatives data suggest sidelined retail traders may be creating room for smart money accumulation, while positive funding rates and rising bullish bets add to the bullish case.\nStellar’s derivatives data hints at a potential reversal. According to Coinglass, the long-to-short ratio for XLM has reached 1.14 on Thursday, the highest level in over a month. The ratio above one suggests that more traders are betting on XLM’s price to rally.\nXLM long-to-short ratio chart. Source: Coinglass\nXLM’s funding rate data is positive and reads 0.0085% on Thursday, indicating that longs are paying shorts. Generally, a positive rate (longs pay shorts) indicates bullish sentiment, while negative numbers (shorts pay longs) indicate bearishness.\nXLM funding rate chart. Source: Coinglass\nCryptoQuant Spot Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency Surge data shows that XLM currently has less retail activity. Historically, when XLM had little retail speculation, it cleared the way for sustained, trend-based movements, boosting its prices.\nXLM Spot Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency Surge chart. Source: CryptoQuant\nStellar price trades inside a bullish pennant pattern formed by connecting two trendlines, joining the highs and lows. This pattern favours the bull as it is formed after a massive upward price trend, and a breakout indicates continuation of the upward momentum. At the time of writing on Thursday, XLM trades around $0.42 within the pattern.\nSideline investors looking to accumulate XLM could do so between $0.40 and $0.36, support ranges, with a tighter stop loss below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average at $0.35.\nIf XLM breaks above this pennant pattern, it could extend the rally toward its July 18 high at $0.52. A successful close above this level could extend gains towards its November high of $0.63.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 54, after bouncing off its neutral level of 50 and pointing upwards, indicating bullish momentum is gaining traction.\nXLM/USDT daily chart\nHowever, if XLM faces a correction, it could extend the decline toward its 50-day EMA at $0.35.",
