  "text": "Apple is set to release its quarterly earnings on July 31, 2025, with analysts expecting a 4.2% increase in revenue to US$89.34 billion for the April-June period.\nThe company faces ongoing challenges from US tariffs, competition in China, and a delayed entry into the AI sector.\nApple has shifted some iPhone production to India to reduce the impact of potential US tariffs on foreign-made devices.\nAnalysts estimate the financial hit from tariffs could be less than US$900 million, below earlier projections.\niPhone sales are expected to have increased by 2.2% in the fiscal third quarter, partly due to higher demand in China, where quarterly sales rose 8%, fueled in part by the recent 618 shopping festival, according to Counterpoint Research.\nSales of other Apple devices are projected to slow, while services revenue is expected to rise to 10.7% of total revenue, according to LSEG.\nApple’s slow rollout of new AI features has led to concerns about its competitiveness in the fast-growing AI market.\n🔗 Source: Reuters\n🧠 Food for thought 1️⃣ Major supply chain shifts require years of strategic planning, not reactive moves Apple’s production pivot demonstrates how supply chain diversification is a long-term strategic initiative rather than a quick tariff response.\nThe company expects that by June 2025, most U.S.-bound iPhones will originate from India, with over 50% of American iPhone sales coming from Indian manufacturing facilities 1 2 .\nThis shift has already driven a 240% increase in Indian-made smartphones in the second quarter, largely attributed to Apple’s supply chain transition 3 .\nThe timeline reveals that meaningful supply chain diversification takes years to execute effectively, requiring companies to begin strategic shifts well before external pressures become critical.\nApple’s approach of maintaining China as a manufacturing hub for non-U.S. markets while developing alternative locations shows how global companies can hedge geopolitical risks without abandoning established production capabilities 1 .\n2️⃣ Corporate political influence creates uneven tariff impacts across business sizes Apple’s success in securing tariff exemptions highlights how large corporations can leverage political access to protect their margins while smaller competitors absorb the full cost burden.\nApple received exemptions on key products including the Apple Watch shortly after CEO Tim Cook’s direct meetings with the Trump administration, demonstrating the effectiveness of high-level political engagement 4 .\nThis stands in stark contrast to smaller businesses like Mid Continent Nail Corp., which reported 25% cost increases and subsequent layoffs when unable to secure similar relief 4 .\nThe tariffs often act as a selective tax that disproportionately affects companies without substantial lobbying resources or political connections.\nApple’s US$350 billion US investment commitment, announced alongside its tariff relief efforts, illustrates how large corporations can package policy requests with broader economic promises 5 .\nRecent Apple developments",
