  "text": "Here’s a breakdown of the provided text, focusing on the key recommendations and arguments made by the Florida Atlantic University researchers:\nCore Proposal:\nprioritize High-potency Statins: Cardiologists should start patients on the highest doses of the most potent statins ( rosuvastatin and atorvastatin ) as the primary pharmacologic treatment for cardiovascular disease , in addition to therapeutic lifestyle changes.\nKey Arguments and Supporting Points:\nStatins as the Foundation: The strongest and most consistent evidence supports the use of statins, especially rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, for both treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease in all populations, including older adults.\nAll other adjunctive drug therapies should only be considered after achieving maximal doses of statins.\nImportance of Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLCs): TLCs are crucial and effective, both with and without medication.\nProven TLCs include:\nQuitting smoking.\nMaintaining a healthy weight and blood pressure.\nRegular physical activity.\nRestricting alcohol consumption.\nAddressing the Gap in TLCs: Despite their effectiveness, many adults (around 40%) have metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors that substantially increases cardiovascular risk. A large percentage of Americans (about 79%) do not meet the minimum daily physical activity requirements.\nMeaningful increases in physical activity are achievable at any age.\nStatin Dosing Strategy: Since patients often stay on their initial statin dose, it’s recommended to start with the highest dose and titrate down if necessary.\nAspirin’s Role: The benefits of statins and aspirin are at least additive,and possibly synergistic.\nAspirin should be prescribed for most secondary prevention patients.\nFor primary prevention, aspirin should be considered after statins, and only if the residual risk of occlusion outweighs the risk of major bleeding (primarily gastrointestinal).\nCautious View on Other Adjunctive Therapies: Ezetimibe and evolocumab are used more widely than optimal. Ezetimibe showed only minor benefits when added to simvastatin (IMPROVE-IT trial).\nEvolocumab’s efficacy was demonstrated primarily in secondary prevention for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia already on maximal statins (FOURIER trial).\nThese therapies are likely best reserved for select high-risk patients who don’t reach LDL goals with statins alone.\nOmega-3 Fatty Acids: Earlier trials were positive, but later ones showed no net benefit, possibly due to widespread statin use.\nIcosapent ethyl (in the REDUCE-IT trial) is the only omega-3 fatty acid to show notable added benefits when combined with evidence-based doses of high-potency statins.\nIn essence, the researchers are advocating for a “statin-first” approach, emphasizing the maximal use of high-potency statins as the cornerstone of cardiovascular disease management, with lifestyle changes as a vital complement, and other medications used more judiciously.",
