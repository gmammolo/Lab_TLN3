  "text": "Crews on Friday continued to gain ground against nearly half a dozen major wildfires burning across California, just as another heat wave descended on the state. The largest of the blazes, the Sites Fire in Colusa County, remained at 19,195 acres and was 30% contained, up from 20% nearly 24 hours earlier, according to Cal Fire. Temperatures in the area neared 100 degrees, and hot and relatively dry conditions were expected to continue into Saturday, the agency said in a situation summary Friday night. The forecast also calls for an increase in southerly winds later in the day. The fire continues to threaten 326 structures. However, with the exception of Sites Ladoga Road from Sites to Ladoga, all evacuation orders have been reduced to warnings. The Post Fire in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, the second largest blaze in the state, covered 15,690 acres, a figure that has not changed since Tuesday night. As of Friday night, the fire was 68% contained. Cal Fire said the weekend will bring triple-digit temperatures to the area, along with humidity levels in the teens and winds up to 30 mph. Thunderstorms are also possible Sunday. In Calaveras County, crews increased containment of the 5,351-acre Aero Fire to 67%. The blaze has destroyed three structures and damaged one other; 542 remain threatened. All evacuation orders related to the fire were lifted as of noon Friday, according to Cal Fire. The Point Fire in Sonoma County and the Hesperia Fire in San Bernardino County — the fourth and fifth largest fires in the state, respectively — were approaching full containment. As of Friday night, the Point Fire covered 1,207 acres and was 80% contained, while the Hesperia Fire covered 1,078 acres and was 91% contained. Cal Fire said one firefighter was injured while battling the Point Fire. The fire has also destroyed three structures and damaged two others. Check back for updates.",
