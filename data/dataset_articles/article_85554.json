  "text": "Last Update28 Jul 25\nThe recent tariff agreements between the United States and the European Union, signed on July 28, 2025, could have indirect implications for companies like ABO Wind, although the company is not specifically mentioned in the current reports. Here's how they might affect you:\n🔍 Tariff Agreement Summary A general tariff of 15% has been established for most European products exported to the US, thus avoiding a 30% tariff that had been initially proposed The agreement includes \"zero tariffs\" on strategic products, such as some agricultural, chemical, aeronautics, and semiconductor products The EU pledges to buy $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest another $600 billion in the U.S., which could affect the energy and trade balance\n🌍 Potential impact on ABO Wind ABO Wind is a German company specialized in the development of renewable energy projects, mainly in Europe and Latin America. Although it has not been directly mentioned in connection with this agreement, there are several factors to consider:\n- Energy competition: Europe's commitment to buy large volumes of U.S. energy could reduce demand for local renewable projects if some of that energy comes from non-renewable sources or if imports are prioritized over domestic development.\n- Export costs: If ABO Wind exports components or services to the U.S., the new 15% tariff could make its operations in that market more expensive, although it is unclear whether its products are included in the list of zero-tariff exceptions.\n- Stock market: European stock markets have reacted with slight increases after the agreement, indicating a perception of stability. However, specific actions such as those of ABO Wind (AB9. F) have not shown any notable movements related to this issue in recent days.\n- Opportunities in Latin America: ABO Wind continues to expand in markets such as Colombia, where it recently signed a deal for a 19.9 MW solar park This suggests that its international strategy could be more focused on regions outside the EU-US axis. This partially protects it from these agreements.\n🔍 1. Overview of ABO Wind AG\nABO Wind AG is a German company specializing in the development of renewable energy projects, primarily wind and solar. Founded in 1996, it operates in over 16 countries and has developed more than 3,600 MW of renewable capacity. Its business model covers everything from planning to construction and operation of energy parks.\n📊 Financial Situation and Outlook\n- In 2024, ABO Wind reported a net profit of €25.6 million, the second-highest in its history.\n- For 2025, the company projects profits between €29 and €39 million, with expectations to reach €50 million annually starting in 2027.\n- The stock has shown strong performance in 2025, hitting a new 6-month high and maintaining a clear upward trend.\n🌍 Benefit from European and German Aid\n✅ 1. Subsidies and Guaranteed Tariffs (EEG)\n- ABO Wind benefits from Germany’s regulated tariff system (EEG), which guarantees a minimum price per kWh generated. In 2025, it won tenders for over 120 MW in wind projects, with average tariffs of 6.83 cents/kWh.\n- These tariffs have been state-funded since 2022, reducing financial risk for developers like ABO Wind.\n✅ 2. Favorable European Regulation\n- The EU has accelerated permitting for renewable projects under the REPowerEU plan, allowing ABO Wind to submit over 850 MW in applications in the first half of 2025 alone.\n- The end of the EU’s emergency regulation created a “rush” in applications, which ABO Wind has capitalized on with an aggressive expansion strategy.\n✅ 3. Next Generation EU Funds\n- While not explicitly mentioned in ABO Wind’s reports, the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) funded by Next Generation EU supports innovative renewable and storage projects.\n- ABO Wind, with operations in Europe: Germany (headquarters), Spain, France, Finland, Ireland, Greece, Poland, Hungary, Netherlands, also United Kingdom, America: Argentina, Colombia, Canada, Africa: Tunisia, South Africa, Tanzania, could benefit indirectly through partnerships or project sales, as it has already done with Endesa.\n- Also United Kingdom, America: Argentina, Colombia, Canada, Africa: Tunisia, South Africa, Tanzania.\n🧠 Fundamental Analysis\nIndicatorValue / CommentRevenue 2024~€200M (estimated from project growth)Net Profit 2024€25.6MProfit Forecast 2025€29–39MEstimated P/E RatioModerate, with growth potentialDebtControlled, many projects self-financedExpected GrowthHigh, driven by tenders and international expansionCompetitive AdvantageExperience, geographic diversification, vertical integration\n📈 Conclusion\nABO Wind AG is in a strong position to capitalize on Europe’s energy transition momentum. Government and EU subsidies, along with a favorable regulatory environment and an expanding project pipeline, reinforce its profile as a sustainable growth stock in the renewable energy sector.\nHow well do narratives help inform your perspective?\nDisclaimer\nThe user kapirey has a position in XTRA:AB9.
