  "text": "The Japanese have produced what could be called a miracle with this new 194 HP box that packs a punch like Manny Pacquiao, small but powerful. The automotive industry has gone through an evolution of sorts in recent years. The large, gas-guzzling engines of yesteryear are becoming about as useful as a speed bump on a runway. However, the traditional gasoline engine still has some life left, so long as it can be adapted to meet the stringent requirements of the climate-conscious buyer and governments of the world.\nThe large internal combustion engine has gone on a diet to remain relevant The emergence of the electric vehicle gave the world a glimpse into a future powered by electricity that required little to no involvement of the old-school internal combustion engines that the world has relied on for generations. The trendy moral superiority that the EV presented to the car buyers of the world was just too good to pass up, and as a result, the EV quickly overtook the competition to become the best-selling vehicle type in the industry.\nHowever, despite the inevitable evolution of our personal mobility options and the electrification of the automotive sector, some in the sector have focused their collective and individual efforts on keeping the dream of gasoline power alive, albeit through a marriage between the two most dominant fuels in the sector. So if the gasoline engine was to remain relevant in modern-day automotive society, it needed to undergo some drastic changes.\nOne Japanese car maker has evolved the engine to new heights and possibilities While some in the automotive industry opt to concentrate their efforts on searching for the next alternative fuel, like a pirate searching for lost treasure, it appears that one Japanese company with an unparalleled reputation in the sector has committed to continuing to develop the engine to integrate with the latest technology that the industry has unearthed.\nThe electrification of the world’s cars and motorways was an inevitability. We were all acutely aware of the need to change the effect the car was having on the environment. One positive from that evolution has been the new approach to how an electric motor can be paired with a traditional engine to deliver unmatched acceleration while keeping emissions low or non-existent in the best cases.\nSubaru’s new Forrester Hybrid delivers the best of what the industry has to offer The Japanese automotive market is capable of stunning innovation, no doubt due to the extreme environment and unique challenges that the Japanese face. Subaru has unveiled its rendition of the hybrid vehicle that packs a 194 HP punch. Subaru has stated that they have developed a series-parallel hybrid system combining a newly developed 2.5-liter SUBARU BOXER engine with electric motors and a high-capacity lithium-ion battery.\nSubaru is betting on hybrid power for the future with the hybrid SUV’s newly developed 2.5-liter Atkinson/Miller-cycle SUBARU BOXER® engine and transaxle that are paired with an electric motor generator and electric traction motor for efficient power. The Hybrid Forrester will include several other features, such as:\nSubaru’s award-winning EyeSight® Driver Assist Technology A tablet-style Subaru 11.6-inch Multimedia Navigation system with wireless Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™ compatibility A 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster The Hybrid Subaru Forrester represents a shift in the automotive sector As the traditional combustion engine gets smaller and smaller, the possibilities seem to be endless. Like a kid in a candy store, the engineers at Subaru must have been giddy with excitement when told they could develop a hybrid for the future. And what they have produced is a prime example of how the automotive sector has shifted focus to the new and innovative as opposed to relying on what works. We welcome this tangible shift as it makes the world a cleaner, safer place to travel and live in. How will the market react to Subaru’s new approach?\nDisclaimer: Our coverage of events affecting companies is purely informative and descriptive.
