  "text": "Hay testing at Snyder Research and Extension Farm, Pittstown. Photo Credit: The Rutgers Agrivoltaics Program. In a stunning blend of agriculture, technology, and energy, the Rutgers Agrivoltaics Program is moving further along with testing the compatibility of solar power panels alongside major commodity crops. Led by RCEI affiliate David Specca , the program has implemented tests with hay in Pittstown, livestock in New Brunswick, soybeans and other vegetables in Cumberland County, and more. So far, the results are promising, with the production of soybeans significantly increasing in areas where solar panels were also established, as opposed to the control plots. In order to maximize power, the panels are even built with trackers that follow the sun, always adjusting into the most optimal position. Possible future improvements include adding further automation to reduce the risk of tractor-panel collisions, but thus far an accident has yet to happen, and the financial benefit of producing not just essential food and fiber, but essential energy as well, far outweighs the minor inconvenience of driving a bit slower in the fields.\nRead more at the full article published by Lancaster Farming.",
