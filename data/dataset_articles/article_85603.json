  "text": "Ethereum 10th anniversary was in July 30, 2025. The events were cross-city and involved livestreams, meet-ups, and special panels. Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin entered the international flow. There was a free NFT mint and attracted mega-interest. The token was minted by thousands, which is one of the milestones of Ethereum as well.\nPrice Boom and Investigation by Institutes The price of Ether got near the mark of 4,000 dollars in the span of the anniversary week. The institutional investment went up and this gave confidence to the market. The analysts predict that the expansion will keep on into Q4 2025. This movement is evidence of its belief in its product, blockchain dominance in the long term.\nThe Ethereum foundation posted a humorous meme, which said, believe in somETHing. It made allusion to Moo Deng, a meme of a viral pygmy hippo. The community is a combination of humor, culture, and blockchain difference-maker. Meme campaigns generate interest and aid in generating engagement throughout significant occasions. Ethereum is successful with this combination of innovation and technology.\nDecentralization and Reliability In ten years, Ethereum has had 100 percent uptime. The centralization is central to the use of Ethereum and its trust in the world. The 10 year anniversary of ethereum was on July 30, 2025. Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Lubin came to the world flow. The minting was free and represented a great event that attracted tremendous excitement.",
