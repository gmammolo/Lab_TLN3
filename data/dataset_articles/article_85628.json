  "text": "Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Expected to Achieve 47% CAGR by 2029: Growth Forecast Insights 07-31-2025 06:21 AM CET | Aerospace & Defense\nPress release from: The Business Research Company Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market\nUse code ONLINE30 to get 30% off on global market reports and stay ahead of tariff changes, macro trends, and global economic shifts\nHow Large Will the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Size By 2025?\nThere has been tremendous growth in the sustainable aviation fuel market in past years. With a massive leap from $0.79 billion in 2024 to an estimated $1.22 billion in 2025, the market is expected to achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 53.7%. This significant growth in the recent years can be attributed to the growing concerns about climatic changes, which has surged the demand for sustainable aviation fuel. The increase in the need for lessening GHG emissions, the global emphasis on curbing carbon emissions, and wide-ranging initiatives for carbon reduction have also significantly contributed to this growth.\nHow Big Is the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Size Expected to Grow by 2029?\nThe market size of sustainable aviation fuel is anticipated to experience a significant increase in the coming years. The market is projected to ramp up to $5.69 billion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.0%. The anticipated growth during this forecast period is primarily due to an amplified employment of sustainable aviation fuel, burgeoning demand for SAF from airline companies worldwide, efforts to enhance supply chain processes to stimulate market growth, and the existence of strict environmentally-focused regulations. Key trends predicted for this forecast period encompass technological progress aligned with rigorous government regulations, advancements in SAF production technologies and diversification of feedstock, technological progression, joint initiatives, and carbon offsetting programs.\nView the full report here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/sustainable-aviation-fuel-global-market-report\nWhich Key Market Drivers Powering Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Expansion and Growth?\nThe sustainable aviation fuel market is expected to experience significant growth, largely due to the increased adoption of biofuels. Biofuels, which are renewable energy sources derived from plant, algal, or animal biomass, are becoming widely accepted owing to the global push for sustainable practices and the commitment of the aviation industry to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By using biofuels, airlines can cut down on their carbon emissions and environmental impact. To illustrate, data from Eurostat, based in Luxembourg, reported in December 2023 that renewable energy made up 23.0% of the total energy consumption within the European Union (EU) in 2022, marking a rise from 21.9% in 2021. Furthermore, the percentage of renewable energy utilized in transport climbed to 9.6% in 2022, up from 9.1% in 2021. Hence, the uptick in the use of biofuels is fuelling the expansion of the sustainable aviation fuel market.\nGet your free sample here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/sample.aspx?id=14514&type=smp\nWhich Fast-Growing Trends Are Poised to Disrupt the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market?\nMajor firms involved in the sustainable aviation fuel marketplace are championing innovative mechanisms, such as fuel process technologies, in an effort to diminish aviation's environmental footprint. Fuel processing technology deals with the scientific and technological components involved in handling and implementing clean fuels, related chemicals, advanced carbon materials and by-products. For instance, Lummus Technology, an American company known for its process technologies and valuable energy solutions, launched an ethanol-fueled sustainable aviation fuel technology in September 2023. This innovation provides operators a considerable, commercially verified solution for greenhouse gas emission reduction in the aviation sector. Lummus' technology transitions ethanol to sustainable aviation fuel and offers a dependable and secure solution by integrating ethanol to ethylene (EtE), olefin oligomerization, and hydrogenation technologies in a process structure that optimizes SAF yield while reducing capital costs (CAPEX), CO2-specific operational costs (OPEX), and carbon emissions.\nWhat Are the Emerging Segments in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market?\nThe sustainable aviation fuel market covered in this report is segmented -\n1) By Fuel Type: Biofuel, Power-to-Liquid, Gas-to-Liquid\n2) By Blending Capacity: Below 30%, 30% To 50%, Above 50%\n3) By Platform: Commercial Aviation, Military Aviation, Business And General Aviation, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\nSubsegments:\n1) By Biofuel: Biojet Fuel, Algae-based Biofuels, Vegetable Oil-based Biofuels, Waste Oil and Animal Fat-based Biofuels\n2) By Power-to-Liquid: Electro-fuel (e-fuel) Production from Renewable Energy, Hydrogen-based Power-to-Liquid Fuels, CO2-to-fuel Technologies\n3) By Gas-to-Liquid: Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Fuels, Coal-to-Liquid (CTL) Fuels, Natural Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) Fuels\nTailor your insights and customize the full report here:\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/customise?id=14514&type=smp\nWho Are the Global Leaders in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market?\nMajor companies operating in the sustainable aviation fuel market are Shell plc, TotalEnergies SE, BP plc, Eni S.p.A., OMV Group, Neste Oyj, Preem AB, Sustainable Aviation, Aemetis Inc., REG Synthetic Fuels LLC, Ballard Power Systems, ZeroAvia Inc., AvFuel Corporation, LanzaTech Inc., Sundrop Fuels Inc., LanzaJet Inc., Fulcrum BioEnergy Inc., SkyNRG BV, Alder Fuels, Red Rock Biofuels, SG Preston Company, Velocys Plc, WasteFuel, World Energy, SAF+ International Group, Gevo Inc., Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels LLC., AltAir Fuels, REG Geismar LLC\nWhich are the Top Profitable Regional Markets for the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Industry?\nNorth America was the largest region in the sustainable aviation fuel market in 2024.
