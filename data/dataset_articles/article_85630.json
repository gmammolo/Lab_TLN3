  "text": "The best selling vehicle in China in the first half of 2025 was a $10,000 EV you've probably never heard of\nPublished on Jul 31, 2025 at 8:17 AM (UTC+4)\nby Claire Reid\nLast updated on Jul 31, 2025 at 8:17 AM (UTC+4)\nEdited by\nClaire Reid\nThe best-selling vehicle in China in the first half of this year is a low-price EV that might not even be on your radar.\nThe EV topped the sales charts, facing off tough competition from the likes of BYD and Tesla.\nMore than 200,000 sales of the EV have been recorded from January to June.\nAnd with a price tag of under $10,000, it’s not hard to see why it’s such a success.\nDISCOVER SBX CARS – The global premium auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie\nThe best-selling vehicle in China may come as a surprise\nChinese carmakers are enjoying a surge in market share lately, particularly when it comes to EVs.\nIn fact, Chinese brands even managed to collectively outsell Mercedes vehicles in Europe in early 2025.\nAnd over in China, there’s one particular car that’s proving very popular with motorists.\nSo popular that it’s even managed to outsell the BYD Seagull and the Tesla Model Y.\nThe Geely Xingyuan was introduced in September of last year and has proved to be a big hit in a relatively short space of time.\nChinese media outlet Yiche reports that almost 205,000 Xingyuan models were sold in China up to June, followed by the Seagull with 174,912 units, and the Model Y selling 17,491.\nThe car comes with a starting price of around $10,000, but don’t let the low price tag fool you; the Geely Xingyuan is an impressive little car that doesn’t skimp on performance.\nThe Xingyuan, or ‘Star Wish’, rides on Geely’s modular SEA platform, which has been cleverly adapted to create a smaller and more urban-centric EV.\nIt’s smaller size means its ideal for city driving and getting into tight spaces and parking spots.\nThe Xingyuan can be ordered with either the standard 58kW motor or a higher-spec 85kW one.\nThe base model will give you 192 miles of range, while the latter offers up to 255 miles.\nGeely is gearing up to launch a ‘disruptor’ hybrid vehicle\nWhile the Geely Xingyuan is currently the best-selling vehicle in China, the marque isn’t resting on its laurels.\nThe company recently unveiled its Geely Galaxy A7, dubbing it the ‘hybrid family sedan disruptor’.\nWhile hybrids are nothing new, this one stands out thanks to its range of more than 1,300 miles on a full tank and a fully charged battery.\nGeely also claims its combined fuel consumption works out to a staggering 117.6 miles per gallon.\nPre-sales of the hybrid started earlier this month, with the car set to be officially launched on August 8.\nDISCOVER SBX CARS:\nThe global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie\nClaire Reid is a journalist who hails from the UK but is now living in New Zealand.
