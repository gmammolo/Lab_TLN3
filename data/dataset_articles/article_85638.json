  "text": "Electric bus adoption in public transport urban fleet is growing all over the world. It started in China, and it has taken a few years for other regions to start the transition.\nBattery-electric bus registrations in Europe reached 5,315 units in the first half of 2025, extending the upward trajectory seen over the past three years and marking a +41% increase on the first half of 2024 (when 3,751 were registered)\nIn 2024, the electric city bus market in Europe (including the UK) grew 22% on 2023 , reaching the figure of 7,779 electric bus registrations (over 8 ton). While the e-bus market in EU27 saw Daimler Buses and Iveco Bus (the strongest-growing OEM in the chart, after VDL) achieving the first two positions, two of the three top sellers such as Yutong and Wrightbus reached such position thanks to the good performance in the market of Great Britain.\nThe European e-bus market 2023 had seen a 53% growth in registrations : as many as 6,354 were registered in EU27 + Norway, Iceland and Switzerland. Over 42% of city buses were zero-emission (BEV and Hydrogen), quickly growing from 15% in 2020 (tripling in three years).\nBy 2030, Europe’s roads could host as many as 108,000 zero-emission buses and coaches , according to a Market Readiness Analysis about “Expected uptake of alternative fuel heavy-duty vehicles until 2030 and their corresponding infrastructure needs “, released by the European Commission in early 2025.\nYEAR BATTERY-ELECTRIC BUS REGISTRATIONS TREND YoY SHARE ON CITY BUS MARKET 2020 2,062 +22% 15% 2021 3,282 +48% 20% 2022 4,152 +26% 30% 2023 6,354 +53% 42% 2024 7,779 +22% H1 2025 5,315 +41%\n(on H1 2024) ELABORATION SUSTAINABLE BUS ON DATA BY CHATROU CME SOLUTIONS / from 2024: DVV Media Let’s just make a few steps behind. The year 2019 will be remembered as the year when the electric bus sales volumes definitive ramp up . While in 2018 the European electric bus market increased of 48 per cent compared to 2017 , the year 2019 saw a tripling in the number of electric bus registration in Western Europe . And in 2020, the year of Covid, the battery-electric bus market in the same region increased of 22% : 2,062 e-buses were registered . What is worth mentioning, six European countries in 2020 have registered a number of zero emission buses (battery-electric plus fuel cell buses) accounting for over 25% of the Class I registrations .\nElectric bus market in Europe 2024 Yutong, Mercedes, and Wrightbus leading the market Leading the charge in 2024 is Yutong , which saw a staggering 99.8% increase in registrations, reaching 1,092 electric buses , up from 483 in 2023. This sharp rise has catapulted the Chinese manufacturer to a 14% market share in Europe, a notable jump from 7.6% in 2023. Similarly, Daimler Buses has grew 105.8%, registering 918 buses compared to 446 in 2023. This growth has earned Mercedes an 11.8% market share, up from 7%.\nThe stronger leap ahead over the last three years has been made by Northern Irish Wrightbus , with 861 electric buses registered in 2024, a 83.6% increase from the previous year. And 2023 saw the manufacturer growing 4-folds.\nElectric bus deployment forecasts according to studies According to the 2024 Electric Vehicle Outlook , “Municipal buses continue to electrify at a rapid pace and exceed 60% of sales already by 2030, reaching 83% by 2040 ”. According to Bloomberg, e-buses are expected to represent 86% of the global fleet as of 2050 . The segment is said to be “Almost on track: minor additional measures needed” by BloombergNEF analysts concerning the level of policy intervention needed to achieve the Net Zero Scenario of 100% ZEV share by 2050.\nIndustrial landscape is changing: since 2017, EU manufacturers’ market share in the e-bus segment has declined from 74% to 54% , while Chinese manufacturers have risen to 24%, reads Rabobank‘s analysis “Electric city buses: Trade and technological dynamics shape the sector“ , out in mid 2024.\nAccording to another study released in 2021 and signed by financial consulting company ING , a third of the 200,000 buses in European public transport will be zero-emission by 2030. At that year, zero emission buses will cover two thirds of the new city bus registrations. ING clearly reads: «This will be the decade of change».\nGlobal electric bus market to reach 670k units in 2027 (from 112k in 2022), reads a study by MarketsandMarkets . Quoting from the report: «The North America which includes US and Canada is projected to be the fastest-growing market during the forecast period . The increasing demand for electric mass transit solutions, renowned OEMs expanding in the region, and government support are factors driving the North American Electric Bus Market.\nA growing number of electric buses running worldwide India is a market with big potential , when even a small part of the orders will be electric. By 2025, the research company Interact Analysis forecasted in 2020 that « India will account for more than 10% of the total annual demand for electric buses globally, which is more than Europe and North America combined ». A share between 11 and 13% of new bus sales in 2025 are expected to be electric in India, according to a research by investment agency ICRA Limited. The penetration of zero-emission buses stood at 5-6 per cent during the first half of 2023.\nThe Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME) programmes facilitated the deployment of over 10,000 buses in major cities through innovative financing models . The government agency Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL) is now leading the ambitious National Electric Bus Program (NEBP), with the goal of introducing 50,000 electric buses across the country by 2030 .\nThe Indian e-bus market witnessed a growth of 65% in 2022 . However, reporting from Reuters found in late 2022 that “Indian banks are reluctant to lend to electric-bus makers” .\nIn 2024 , India registered 3,616 electric buses , while diesel bus registrations exceeded 41,000, based on figures from government database Vahan portal. In India’s 2024 HPV electric bus market, Tata Motors led with 1,431 registrations , capturing 40% of the market share. Olectra Greentech and JBM Auto (that just secured an order for 1,021 electric buses under the Government of India’s PM e-Bus Sewa Scheme-2 initiative) followed, registering 630 and 556 units respectively, representing 17.7% and 15.6% of the market.\nElectric bus market in the US And United States ? Market penetration was at about 0.5% of the total U.S. public transit bus market at the end of 2017, but in the same time 9% of all transit agencies either had electric buses in service or on order. Things are moving fast! Anyhow, according to BloombergNEF figures, at the end of 2019 in the US «around 450 of the nearly 75,000 municipal buses on the road were e-buses». Zero emission bus deployment in the US has been growing 27% in 2021 , up to 3,533 buses (on the road and on order).\nAccording to Dan Raudebaugh , Executive Director for the Center for Transportation and the Environment (CTE) , in October 2020 there were « slightly over 1,000 zero-emission buses deployed in the US . I think the rate of increase of that figure may slow some due to COVID, like everything else. In the long term, I think this market will continue to grow rapidly . In fact, I think the transit market may be the first major vehicle market to completely switch to zero emissions ».\nAccording to CALSTART, US saw 12% surge in zero emission bus adoption in 2023 (with H2 buses growing 76%). The figure takes into account e-buses both ordered and deployed). A total of 6,147 vehicles are counted for the US (dated as of September 2023). In 2023, still according CALSTART figures, the US e-bus market had experienced a 66% increase . Particularly, fuel cell bus figures grew strongly in 2023 , showing a 76% increase (from 211 to 327 units). What is also interesting, CALSTART’s Mike Hynes said in an interview with Sustainable Bus that “Orders for electric trucks and buses are to rise to 54,000 units by 2025” in the US.\nIn late 2024, EPA funded purchase of 2,400 zero emission heavy-duty vehicles , with 70% of the investments for school buses.\nLatin America, the transition to electric buses is now! According to the figures from E-Bus Radar , backed by ZEBRA alliance, as of April 2025 6,800 e-buses are operating in Latin America.\nIn this landscape, Santiago de Chile is on track to consolidate its position as the leading city for electric public transport outside of China, with 4,406 electric buses expected to be in operation by the end of 2025 . In mid-December 2023 a tender was issued in the city to renew 30 percent of the public transport system Red Movilidad . The tender provided for the introduction in the network of 1,200 zero emission buses (out of 2,100 new buses) and ’embraces’ 121 routes. In August 2024 Chinese OEM Yutong delivered 214 e-buses in Santiago . The Chilean capital aims to introduce 1,800 e-buses this year (thus achieving 68% zero emission bus fleet) .\nBack to some years ago, in 2018 and 2019 two important south American cities announced big plans of transition to electric buses of their public transport fleet. Chile aims to have the second largest electric bus fleet in the world after China. Santiago de Chile already received 200 electric buses from China: half are Yutong branded , the other half are BYD buses . Santiago paved the way, Medellin follows. A few weeks after the delivery of 100 BYD electric buses to Santiago, the Colombian city ordered 64 zero emission buses from BYD, thus making the first steps towards the first electric fleet in the Latin American country.\nA project to speed up electric bus adoption in South America «Shift all new bus procurements in leading Latin American cities to Zero Emission technologies». It’s the ultimate goal of ZEBRA project , carried out by ICCT and C40 with focus on the South American cities of Medellin, Mexico City, São Paulo, Santiago de Chile .\nIn late 2022 São Paulo’s Transit Agency SPTrans (over 13,000 buses) has banned the procurement of new diesel buses in the city . Earlier in the same year, Colombia’s capital city Bogotá stopped procuring fossil-fuelled buses in the city. The news is reported on local media and on C40 website. It is expected that by the end of 2024, São Paulo will have at least 2,600 e-buses operating on municipal lines.\nVolvo Buses in 2023 has begun the first demonstration of its 100% electric city bus in real operation in Latin America . The same year saw the entry in the Mexican bus market of Irizar e-mobility .\nForecasts on e-bus deployment in Latin America 25,000 e-buses are expected to be on Latin American roads by 2030 . Recent data indicates a growth of over 100% in the number of electric public buses between 2020 and April 2023 in the region , marking a pivotal moment in the quest for sustainable urban mobility.\nAs of late 2023, according to the E-Bus Radar, electric buses constitute 4.5% of the total bus fleet in the 32 cities under examination in the new study “ Pipeline of Electric Bus Projects in Latin America “, commissioned by C40 in conjunction with the Clean Transport Finance Academy 2023.\nThe research estimates the deployment of over 25,000 e-buses by 2030 and a staggering 55,000 by 2050 . This projected growth comes with a substantial investment of $13.2 billion.\nElectric buses in Europe. What’s going on? The beginning. The electric bus revolution in Amsterdam region At the end of 2018 , the largest fleet of electric bus in Europe is the one operated by Connexxion around Schipol airport . VDL Bus & Coach has supplied 100 electric buses to Connexxion (part of Transdev) for the Amstelland Meerlanden concession, which were put in service on 1 April 2018.\nThe order of electric buses for Amstelland Meerlanden ‘s electric bus fleet is still the largest single order for VDL Bus & Coach, and with 100 electric buses it is the largest electric bus fleet within a single operation in Europe. The 100 articulated e-buses collectively cover up to 30,000 km per day. These batteries are charged in 20 minutes or less at charging points along the route, allowing 24-hour service.\nAnd Amsterdam city center is no exception. The first vehicles were delivered in spring 2020 in the city. And more are to come: the deal signed in December 2018 between the carrier and VDL Bus & Coach consists of no less than 31 electric buses , 9 12-meter and 22 articulated ones. And there is also an option for 69 extra electric buses.\nRotterdam and electric bus. And Keolis with a major order… In 2018, the Dutch manufacturer VDL Bus & Coach has been award with a 55 units of electric bus contract by Rotterdam public transport operator RET . During the same year 2018, also the Dutch public transport company EBS put 10 units of the electric bus VDL Citeas SLFA-181 in service .\nRemaining in the Netherlands, in The Hague, Heliox delivered to HTM a fast charging system for the charging operations of 9 VDL electric buses.\nHowever, after booming years in the first stage and a good 2022, in 2023 VDL experienced a significant decline in e-bus registrations. The group is struggling to maintain a strong foothold in the European e-mobility market. The bus & coach division saw revenue down 40% in half 2023 .\nNetherlands leading Europe on electric bus adoption Dutch electric bus market has been the first to show a clear rise in Europe, taking a leading position. The reason for that is quite simple: in 2015, the leaders of the PTAs in the Netherlands came to an agreement . From 2025 on, newly bought buses for public transport can only be emission free. In early 2020 10 percent of the Dutch fleet is already electrified . And this rapid growth brings several challenges and opportunities .\nIn March 2019, it has been made public that more than 160 electric buses will hit the streets of the new concession Groningen-Drenthe . The public transport operator Qbuzz , owned by Italian railways FS, will receive the large batch of vehicles from three manufacturers: the largest fleet will be provided by Ebusco with 60 ebuses , while VDL will provide 43 zero emission vehicles and Heuliez Bus further 59 . These 162 buses will join 10 VDL ebuses already in operation.\nIn September 2019 Keolis has been awarded a new concession in the provinces of Veluwe, Central Overijssel and Lelystad for the period 2021 – 2030 .\nFollowing this new contract, Keolis awarded BYD with the largest single order so far secured in Europe for this kind of technology: 259 BYD battery-electric buses were deployed (with some issues arising ).\nElectric bus fleets in UK, Stagecoach docet 105 double decker units of electric bus have been introduced in the fleet between 2019 and 2020 . It’s the plan revealed by the British operator Stagecoach in September 2018. The investment will be around £56m (34.6m from the company, 21.5 from the government). Enviro400 EV City by ADL – BYD is the electric bus model involved in the project.\nElectric public transport back in Glasgow In the first days of 2019, Stagecoach received its first electric buses by ADL – BYD, ready to be deployed in Guildford . And electric buses have been also launched in Glasgow. Friday 10th January 2020 has been the first day on the road for the two 10.8-meter zero emission vehicles produced by the joint venture between ADL and BYD .\nElectric bus adoption and smart garage in London As widely known, London is the leader of the transition to electric buses in the UK. BYD and ADL delivered in November 2018 a 36 vehicles electric bus order in the capital city.\nBut the big news is not necessarily this one. What is also very interesting is that the companies, together with the strategic partner SSE , transformed the historic and land-locked RATP Dev Shepherd’s Bush garage in West London into an advanced, smart electric bus operating centre , that is expected to become the company’s first zero emission bus garage in London.\nAccording to the plans, by 2037 all buses in London (about 8,000) will be zero-emission . As a further step towards this goal, 34 CaetanoBus electric buses will hit London roads for the operator Abellio from March 2020. These will be the first Caetano electric buses for the UK .\nFirst Bus: electric bus deployment for Oxford In early 2024, the Go-Ahead Group announced it has joined partners in Oxford to launch one of the UK’s biggest fleets of electric buses . A £82.5 million project will deliver 159 battery buses onto the streets of Oxford – the first of which have already gone into service, Go-Ahead states.\nGo-Ahead had been celebrating 10 years of electric bus operation in London in late 2023: the company operates 520 zero emission buses on behalf of TfL and expects to increase this number to 1,000 by the end of 2026 – account for almost half the company’s fleet. According to plans, Go-Ahead’s entire fleet of 5,000 UK buses will be converted to zero emission vehicles by 2035 . It’s just one of the pillars of the company’s strategy to reach carbon neutrality by 2045 .",
