  "text": "Highlights\nMicrosoft reported higher-than-expected revenue and earnings growth in its fiscal fourth quarter, with nearly all business units delivering double-digit percentage growth in the top line.\nAzure revenue surged to a record $75 billion for the year, as Microsoft gained cloud market share every quarter in the fiscal year.\nMicrosoft expanded its data center footprint to more than 400 sites in 70 regions and introduced a sovereign cloud offering. It expects to spend $30 billion in capex in Q1, to meet AI infrastructure demand.\nMicrosoft ended its fiscal year with a blowout fourth-quarter performance, driven by demand for cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) services that led to a 34% increase in Azure’s annual revenue to a record $75 billion.\nWe’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.",
