  "text": "AInvest Newsletter\nDaily stocks & crypto headlines, free to your inbox\nHyperliquid's recent HIP-3 growth mode upgrade has been a cornerstone of its success, enabling permissionless perpetual market creation while\nfor new markets. This innovation allows users to deploy custom perpetual contracts by staking 500,000 HYPE tokens, fostering a democratized liquidity ecosystem. By reducing taker fees to as low as 0.00144% for top-tier traders, the platform has incentivized liquidity providers to capitalize on niche markets, and open interest to $1.77 billion by November 2025. The dual-layer architecture of Hyperliquid-combining the HyperEVM for EVM compatibility and the Unit layer for high-speed execution-has further solidified its appeal. This system supports cross-asset trading and streamlined on-chain settlement, by June 2025. Such technical advancements have positioned Hyperliquid as a direct competitor to centralized exchanges, flowing through its platform in Q3 2025.Institutional confidence in Hyperliquid has been bolstered by strategic partnerships and adherence to regulatory frameworks. The platform's integration with Anchorage Digital and Circle's CCTP V2 has enhanced its custodial and cross-chain capabilities, while\nhas attracted risk-averse investors. These measures align with broader industry trends, as institutional players increasingly seek DeFi solutions that balance innovation with regulatory clarity.A landmark development in November 2025 was Hyperliquid's business combination with Sonnet BioTherapeutics and Rorschach I LLC, forming Hyperliquid Strategies Inc. (HSI). This entity,\n, holds $583 million in HYPE tokens and $305 million in cash, with institutional heavyweights like Paradigm, Galaxy Digital, and Pantera Capital participating in the funding round. The transaction, led by former JP Morgan CEO Bob Diamond as Chairman and Atlas Capital's David Schamis as CEO, signals a strategic pivot toward public market exposure for HYPE, .Hyperliquid's TVL surged to $2.15 billion by November 2025,\n. This growth is underpinned by the platform's deflationary token model, , creating a direct link between platform activity and token value. Additionally, Hyperliquid has captured 62.26% of Arbitrum's liquidity, . The platform's hybrid trading model-combining on-chain order books with off-chain matching-has further enhanced execution quality, .Hyperliquid's price surge in late 2025 is not merely a function of speculative fervor but a reflection of its structural advantages in on-chain liquidity and institutional infrastructure. The HIP-3 growth mode has democratized market creation, while strategic partnerships and regulatory alignment have positioned HYPE as a bridge between DeFi and traditional finance. With a TVL exceeding $3.5 billion and a growing institutional footprint, Hyperliquid is redefining the decentralized derivatives landscape. As the platform prepares for public market exposure through HSI, investors may view HYPE's rally as a harbinger of broader adoption in the next phase of DeFi's evolution.\nDaily stocks & crypto headlines, free to your inbox\nNo comments yet",
