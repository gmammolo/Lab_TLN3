  "text": "NOW Tops Microsoft Stock on Price & Potential\nNOW is Microsoft’s peer in Systems Software industry that has:\n1) Lower valuation (P/OpInc) compared to Microsoft stock\n2) But higher revenue and operating income growth\nThis disconnect between valuation and performance could mean that you are better off buying NOW stock vs. MSFT stock\nYou can’t predict what happens to individual stocks, but you can prepare. See how High Quality Portfolio helps you.\nKey Metrics Compared\n| Metric |\n|\n|---|\nNOW\nOpInc = Operating Income, P/OpInc = Price To Operating Income Ratio\nBut do these numbers tell the full story? Read Buy or Sell MSFT Stock to see if Microsoft still has an edge that holds up under the hood. As a quick background, Microsoft (MSFT) provides software, services, devices, and solutions, including Office, Microsoft Teams, Windows OEM licensing, and productivity tools for business and personal computing needs.\nThis is just one approach to evaluate investments. Trefis High Quality Portfolio evaluates much more, and is designed to reduce stock-specific risk while giving upside exposure\nIs The Mismatch In Stock Price Temporary\nOne way to check if Microsoft stock is expensive now versus the other tickers would be to see how these metrics compared across companies exactly a year ago. Specifically, if there has been a marked reversal in the trend for Microsoft in the last 12 months, then there is a chance that the current mismatch is likely to reverse. On the other hand, a persistent underperformance in revenue and operating income growth for Microsoft would reinforce the conclusion that the stock is expensive compared to its peers, but may not revert soon\nKey Metrics Compared 1 Yr Prior\n| Metric |\n|\n|---|\nNOW\nOpInc = Operating Income\nAdditional Metrics To Consider\n| Metric |\n|\n|---|\nNOW\nOpInc = Operating Income\nAlternate buying based on valuation, while attractive, needs to be evaluated carefully from multiple angles. Such multi-factor analysis is exactly how we construct Trefis portfolio strategies. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the its benchmark – a combination of S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap index.",
