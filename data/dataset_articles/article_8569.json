  "text": "BAY COUNTY, Fla. ( [WMBB](https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/local-news/bay-county/fire-officials-offer-tips-for-safe-fireworks-handling-this-4th-of-july/)) – Many people will be preparing for the 4th of July holiday which is just 2 weeks away. Fire officials are warning residents about the dangers of handling their own fireworks. There are some important tips you should know to help keep you and your family safe. While thousands will go out to public firework viewings to celebrate Independence Day, some may opt for fireworks at home. If this is the case officials are offering some tips to avoid a fire while having fun. Andy Biondo from the Office of Financial Services said it’s important to stay vigilant while handling the fireworks. “People are easily distracted with phones and everything, and you’re fighting off bombs in essence. So you must be very careful taking care of those types of things,” Biondo said. He also said having a bucket of water handy and only lighting fireworks in an open area are good ways to prevent a fire from breaking out. Howard Demro from the Panama City Fire Department said what you do after the fireworks is just as important as the preparation. “They’re really hot after you get done using them. And if you dispose of them too quickly in your trash can, you could most likely have a trash can fire later in the night if you’re not careful. So we recommend to put them in a five-gallon bucket of water,” Fire Prevention Lt. Howard Demro said. Demro also said small children should be away from any fireworks. “We don’t want any kids to be lighting any fireworks this holiday. We asked that only adults be near and around the fireworks when they’re being lit and they’re the only ones that are lighting fireworks off,” Demro said. Fire officials warn residents to practice caution when using fireworks but they also want to remind residents to not forget about their furry friends. Additionally, officials said you should always make sure your pets are in a safe space away from the fireworks before you begin lighting them. He also suggests keeping pets inside during the fireworks. Officials said residents should take advantage of public firework showings where viewers are kept a safe distance away from the fireworks. In the month around the 4th of July 2022, 11 people died in fireworks-related incidents, 5 because they misused the fireworks, and more than 10,000 people were injured using fireworks.",
