  "text": "Problem Description\nModern learning environments should reflect the realities of future living and careers. Understanding technology and computers is a must for all employees, and the requirements for qualifications will grow in the next decade. At the same time, the abundance and ease of use of technology enable new types of conventional and unconventional learning.\nFinally, student diversity demands that teachers adapt their strategies to ensure everyone learns according to their capabilities. Teachers have a varied understanding of technology and how to apply it in elementary schools. For any technological advances to be practical, educators must be brought to a standard of minimal technological competence.\nAnalysis\nThe standards of technological competence among teachers are few and far between. Due to differences in when teachers received their education, the type of approach, and the state of technological competence at the time, the understanding of how to use technology is not uniform. Within the same school, individuals may fully utilize all the instruments available to educators, ranging from VR to hearing aids, computers, and online presentation tools (Han, 2020). Others, in the meantime, may be struggling to utilize the basic functions of their smartphone.\nAt the same time, the usefulness of technology in education is an undisputed fact. Various means of information delivery ensure that all types of learning are engaged during the process. In addition, children receive valuable technological skills that will help them in adult life (Patterson & Han, 2019). Finally, the ability of technology to compensate for inconveniences means that the process goes unperturbed by personal challenges. Overall, there is a clear benefit to improving the capabilities of teachers to utilize technology in the elementary classroom.\nDesign\nThe proposed intervention is split into three parts. During the first part, it is suggested that the educators in question would be evaluated based on their capability to understand and utilize technology. This part can be done as a self-report, in which the participants state their technological skills (or lack thereof).\nThe second part will include designing a training schedule to address individual and group deficiencies in skill. It would take approximately 4 weeks, 1.5 hours a day, minus weekends. The training will be done on an extracurricular basis. After the training is complete, teachers will be asked to reassess their capabilities. The results pre- and post-intervention will be compared to determine the program’s efficacy.\nDevelopment\nThe proposed self-assessment form for the project is as follows:\nTable 1 – Self-Assessment Competencies and Elements\nTest Pilot\nThis self-assessment form will be presented to peers and teachers overseeing the project, before being implemented in the field.\nImplementation\nDuring the implementation phase, teachers will receive training on effectively utilizing technology from experienced personnel in the field to deliver adaptive instruction. This will be achieved through various means, such as demonstration, presentation of learning material for individual study, face-to-face interaction, tutoring, and videos dedicated to each part mentioned in the self-assessment form.\nTest Pilot\nFeedback will be received from the participants throughout the process, to receive information on which parts need to be adapted and focused on, for maximum impact.\nEvaluation\nAt the end of each of the four weeks of training, participants will be tasked with passing a test on what they have learned so far. The tests will be graded to oversee the intervention’s progress. If the understanding of the material is not complete, additional time will be dedicated to these subjects. Individuals found lagging will be given extra attention and training opportunities to catch up to the others.\nReflection\nWhile preparing this project, I learned plenty of new knowledge. First, I discovered that the standards for technological training are not as rigorous and all-encompassing as I initially thought. Second, I learned how much technology makes a difference in a diverse classroom. This made me view technology in the classroom in a new light, from being merely a nice addition to an essential part of the education process. In everyday life, I can attempt to implement the whole range of technological advantages during my self-education efforts.\nReferences\nHan, I. (2020).
