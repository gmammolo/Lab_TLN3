  "text": "Introduction\nE-health is an excellent example of how modern technologies can benefit our lives. Remarkably, this instrument can allow people to obtain necessary medical care and information remotely. It is crucial, for example, in such unexpected situations as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAmong the most valuable instruments the patient can use to obtain health services online is the opportunity to obtain information from specialists during online meetings. Healthcare providers can directly answer patients’ questions, educate them to improve the current situation, and make them aware of possible illnesses and outcomes. Moreover, e-health allows people to create personal accounts to track all their medical records, which is popular with mobile apps.\nCancer in the US\nWhile considering the various statistics regarding cancer in the US, it is crucial to highlight that cancer mortality rates have been falling over the past several years. Notably, one should stress that compared to 1990, when the mortality rate per 100,000 people was 279,8 among men and 174,6 among women, the 2017 ratings showed 181,4 and 131,2, respectively. Significant progress must be made, and new methods must be elaborated on to reduce the mortality rate even more. Notably, technological expansion was among the significant reasons why it was possible to reduce the mortality rate. Nowadays, technologies are developing at a high speed and directly ease the approaches in medicine, which gives a chance to find a cure for cancer.\nE-Health Effects\nUsing various technologies, e-health could help maintain the connection with the patient everywhere. Using smartphones mainly allows for gathering the patient’s data regarding their health state, such as heart rate. Various technological companies work on these instruments nowadays, providing unprecedented opportunities for people. Among them are smartwatches, which are always with the person and track their health even while sleeping.\nAll factors mentioned above stress the enormous engagement of patients in the processes of e-health. It allows healthcare providers to gather and monitor the patient’s status constantly and, therefore, to provide necessary recommendations and treatments. One particular example is that doctors provide specific interventions using e-health to promote physical exercise among breast cancer patients.\nE-Health Intervention Details\nConstant communication with the patient allows the healthcare provider to collect information regarding their habits, work, and other aspects of their daily life. This means the doctor can assess the stressors that negatively influence the patient’s health. Particularly regarding cancer, managing specific actions and considering patient needs is possible.\nNotably, the healthcare provider can work with each patient personally and understand the various peculiarities of their illness. After that, the doctor can construct a qualitative approach concerning changing the patient’s behavior while employing different techniques. Some may be changing the patient’s diet, adding specific sports activities, providing unique treatments such as physical activities for breast cancer patients mentioned above, and more.\nE-Health Successes\nConsidering these benefits and positive outcomes of e-health, one should profoundly consider the complete success of implementing e-health systems in the patient’s daily life. Remarkably, one of the most valuable influences is that it allows patients to improve cancer outcomes. It is important to note that e-health influences not only the final result but also the whole process of the treatment.\nFor example, it allows patients to be calmer and relaxed while having constant support from the healthcare provider. While having any questions or misunderstandings, the patient can also promptly receive advice and recommendations from the doctor on how to act and what medications to take. All these factors improve patients’ quality of life and, most importantly, allow them to recover quickly.\nAdded Benefits of E-Health\nAmong other benefits of e-health applications, it is necessary to state the streamlined communication among cancer care providers. It is essential that not only is the contact between the patient and the doctor possible due to modern technologies, but the constant collaboration among various healthcare providers is also achievable. Medical workers can use technologies such as cameras, smartphones, and other techniques to share information regarding critical approaches and instruments to treat the patient. It will not only shorten the time used for collaboration but also significantly improve the patient experience because of the efficient work of doctors. Consequently, patient satisfaction will grow exponentially, and the chance for success will be increased.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, it is necessary to summarize all the benefits of the e-health application. Remarkably, by using this method for patient treatment, healthcare providers can construct a qualitative and helpful strategy. On the one hand, it will allow us to communicate with patients remotely, providing them with all the necessary help and recommendations. It will also increase the outcomes and bring positive effects regarding patient satisfaction.\nOn the other hand, it will improve the work among the doctors by easing their communication and doing it quickly and effectively. One should highlight that modern technologies allow people to use e-health even under challenging situations, such as those with cancer. Healthcare workers can track particular patients’ data and implement various practices like those used for breast cancer patients.",
