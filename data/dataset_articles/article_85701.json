  "text": "Telecanor Global Announces Strategic AI Platform Launch Targeting USD 850 Billion QIS Market\nTelecanor Global Limited announced a strategic transformation to an AI-powered QIS platform targeting the USD 850 billion market, approved by the board on December 19, 2025. The three-phase development plan aims to automate PDF-to-trading strategy conversion, reducing processing time from 30-40 hours to minutes. Financial projections show potential revenue growth from INR 7.50 crores in Year 1 to INR 83.00 crores by Year 3 through a tiered SaaS model.\n*this image is generated using AI for illustrative purposes only.\n Telecanor Global Limited has announced a transformative strategic pivot from its legacy analytics operations to launch an AI-powered quantitative investment strategy (QIS) platform. The company's board of directors approved this major initiative during their meeting held on December 19, 2025, marking what the company describes as a complete business reinvention rather than a routine update.\nStrategic Market Entry\nThe company is positioning itself to enter the USD 850.00 billion QIS market with a solution designed to address a critical industry pain point. Currently, converting complex index rulebooks from PDF format into working trading strategies requires 30-40 hours per strategy and costs thousands of dollars. Telecanor Global's new platform aims to reduce this process to minutes through AI automation.\n| Market Segment | Growth Metrics |\n|---|---|\n| QIS AUM Target | USD 850.00 billion by 2025 |\n| AI Code Tools Market | 27.00% CAGR |\n| AI Trading Platforms | USD 12.50 billion addition by 2029 |\nThree-Phase Development Strategy\nThe company has outlined a comprehensive development roadmap spanning multiple phases:\nPhase 1 (0-10 months) focuses on core functionality, converting QIS PDFs into clean Python code and running backtests with performance metrics display.\nPhase 2 (10-18 months) will introduce advanced features including an interactive strategy editor, AI copilot for strategy explanation and optimization, and multiple output formats supporting Python, JSON, CSV, and API integration.\nPhase 3 (18+ months) represents the platform's maturation with hosting and execution capabilities for institutional clients, complemented by compliance-ready monitoring and audit trail systems.\nFinancial Projections and Business Model\nTelecanor Global plans to implement a tiered SaaS pricing model with Starter, Professional, and Enterprise options. The company expects margins of 70-80% following the R&D phase completion.\n| Timeline | Customer Base | Annual Recurring Revenue |\n|---|---|---|\n| Year 1 | 2-5 customers | INR 7.50 crores |\n| Year 2 | 20 customers | INR 33.00 crores |\n| Year 3 | 40-60 customers | INR 83.00 crores |\nAdditionally, hosting revenue is projected to contribute INR 4.00-8.00 crores to the overall revenue stream.\nGovernance and Risk Management\nThe board has established comprehensive governance protocols for this initiative. All activities will be conducted within approved R&D budgets with no related-party transactions involved. The platform will function as a tooling solution only, providing no investment advice or execution services without proper compliance frameworks.\nRisk Considerations\nThe company has identified several key risk factors including:\n- Technical complexity challenges in AI development\n- Data licensing requirements and costs\n- Extended procurement cycles with institutional clients\n- Evolving AI regulatory norms and compliance requirements\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe company emphasized that projections are based on current market data and development plans, with actual results potentially varying from estimates. The board meeting, which commenced at 1:00 PM and concluded at 1:25 PM, formally noted this strategic initiative with commitments to provide future updates as material developments occur.\nHistorical Stock Returns for TeleCanor Global\n| 1 Day | 5 Days | 1 Month | 6 Months | 1 Year | 5 Years |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| +4.98% | +15.44% | +76.95% | +224.98% | +270.76% | +314.20% |\nView in Depth",
