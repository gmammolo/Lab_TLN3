  "text": "NHPC Launches New 250 MW Unit at Subansiri Lower HE Project, Advancing Toward Full 2000 MW Capacity\nNHPC has successfully launched a new 250 MW unit at its Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project, marking significant progress towards the project's full 2000 MW capacity. This development represents a crucial step in expanding India's renewable energy infrastructure and supporting the country's clean energy transition.\n*this image is generated using AI for illustrative purposes only.\n NHPC has achieved a significant operational milestone with the successful launch of a new 250 MW unit at its Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project. This development marks substantial progress in the company's plan to bring the entire project to its full operational capacity of 2000 MW.\nProject Development Progress\nThe launch of this new unit represents a crucial step forward in the development of the Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project. The project details highlight the scale and importance of this infrastructure development:\n| Parameter | Details |\n|---|---|\n| New Unit Capacity | 250 MW |\n| Total Project Capacity | 2000 MW |\n| Project Type | Hydroelectric Power Generation |\n| Current Status | Progressing Toward Full Operations |\nStrategic Significance\nThe addition of this 250 MW unit demonstrates NHPC's continued commitment to expanding India's renewable energy infrastructure. Hydroelectric projects like Subansiri Lower play a vital role in the country's clean energy transition, providing reliable and sustainable power generation capacity.\nThe successful commissioning of individual units within large-scale hydroelectric projects requires careful coordination and technical expertise. Each unit that comes online brings the project closer to its full operational potential and contributes to the national power grid.\nOperational Impact\nWith this new unit now operational, the Subansiri Lower project moves closer to achieving its full 2000 MW capacity. The systematic approach to bringing units online aims to ensure stable integration with the power grid while maintaining operational efficiency.\nThe project's progression toward full operations represents a substantial addition to India's hydroelectric power generation capacity, supporting the country's growing energy demands through clean and renewable sources.\nHistorical Stock Returns for NHPC\n| 1 Day | 5 Days | 1 Month | 6 Months | 1 Year | 5 Years |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| -0.54% | +3.21% | +1.10% | -8.94% | -5.17% | +236.11% |\nView in Depth",
