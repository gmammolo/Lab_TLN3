  "text": "Mae Fah Luang University (MFU) reaffirms its position as a leading research-driven university in the region through the MFU RESEARCH EXPO 2025, held on 23-24 December 2025 at the Kham Mok Luang Room, M-Square, MFU. The event was organised by the Research Administration Division, under the MFU Research and Innovation Institute, with the theme \"Well-being and Sustainable Future,\" highlighting MFU’s commitment to driving research that improves quality of life.\nThe expo served as a platform for MFU researchers to present their research outcomes from the past year, while also providing a forum for young researchers to gain inspiration and guidance from senior scholars. In addition, the event created opportunities for researchers from different schools to explore potential interdisciplinary research collaborations within the university.\nThe opening ceremony featured welcoming remarks by Asst. Prof. Dr. Matchima Naradisorn, President of MFU, and a report by Prof. Dr. Sujitra Wongkasemjit, Vice President. Distinguished guests included Prof. Dr. Komgrit Leksakul, Deputy Director of Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI); Prof. Dr. Somkiat Wattanasirichaigoon, M.D., Former Director of the Health Systems Research Institute (HSRI); Assoc. Prof. Dr. Nisit Panthamit, Head of the ASEAN Studies Center, Chiang Mai University; along with MFU researchers, students, and staff.\nThe expo featured exhibitions showcasing research outputs from MFU’s 14 schools, reflecting the University’s strengths in research, innovation, and multidisciplinary knowledge in addressing complex global challenges. Key focus areas included natural resource and environmental sustainability; health and natural products; inclusive and sustainable socio-economic development; digital technology for social advancement; research in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS); and initiatives aligned with MFU’s FMFC strategic framework (Innovative Farmers, Traditional Medicines, Healthy Foods, Cosmetics).\nIn addition, MFU presented flagship research from its six Centres of Excellence:\n• Centre of Excellence in Fungal Research showcased the development of biomaterials from mushroom fibers and pigments derived from fungi, utilising local biological resources and waste materials to advance green innovation and future alternative material industries.\n• Centre of Excellence in Natural Products Innovation displayed research on the use of agricultural by-products from corn to develop bioactive ingredients for cosmetics and natural products, aiming to reduce environmental impact and add value to biological resources.\n• Medicinal Plant Innovation Centre presented research on Thai medicinal herbs, including turmeric, Rhinacanthus nasutus, gotu kola, and black ginger, focusing on anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties to support the development of evidence-based herbal and cosmeceutical products.\n• Institute for Mekong Basin Civilisation, Art, and Culture presented research on cultural capital, creative design, and the enhancement of Mekong subregion identity to support the creative economy and sustainable tourism through the integration of research, art, and contemporary culture.\n• Tea and Coffee Institute showcased research and innovation in tea and coffee, ranging from product development and knowledge transfer to communities, to building collaborative networks that drive sustainable grassroots economic development.\n• SMEs Cosmetic Center highlighted initiatives to strengthen the capacity of Thai cosmetic SMEs, elevate product standards, and enhance the competitiveness of the national cosmetic industry.\nBeyond the exhibitions, the expo emphasised knowledge exchange and policy engagement through a range of activities, including a keynote lecture on \"Research Directions under TSRI”; a panel discussion on \"Research Development Trends in the GMS\"; a panel discussion on \"Urgent Issues in Contaminant Management: Mekong and Kok Rivers; as well as the presentation of the Outstanding Research Exhibition Awards.\nIn her opening remarks, Asst. Prof. Dr. Matchima Naradisorn, President of MFU, emphasized that MFU Research Expo 2025 reflects the University’s commitment to fostering a vibrant research culture, empowering researchers, and enhancing the visibility and real-world application of its research outcomes. She further noted that the university’s unique position as a hub connecting neighboring countries and China, presents challenges and opportunities across education, health research, agriculture, and the social sciences. By leveraging its role in the GMS region, MFU has developed a research strategy that fully capitalises on these geographical advantages and creates a clear distinction.\nShe added that, in science and technology, research can support agricultural outputs—such as medicinal plants—by transforming them into food products, medicines, and cosmetics. This represents a key area of expertise at Mae Fah Luang University. In addition, local cultural capital can be enhanced, conserved, and transformed into added value, enabling communities and society to sustain their livelihoods in the long term.\nOverall, MFU Research Expo 2025 provided MFU researchers not only with a platform to showcase the tangible application of research in supporting area-based development, economic growth, and social advancement, but also with inspiration for future interdisciplinary research initiatives.",
