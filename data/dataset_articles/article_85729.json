  "text": "Vijay Sales 2025: This could be the ideal moment to get an iPhone 16. The Apple iPhone 16 is offered at an attractive price all over the Christmas and New Year’s holiday season, which is extremely uncommon.

This gadget offers a number of major upgrades over the iPhone 15 in terms of performance, design, camera, and other area. Vijay Sales is the one offering this deal on the Apple phone.\nApple iPhone 16 discount at Vijay Sales is as follows:\nCurrently priced at Rs 66,900 on Vijay Sales, the 128GB model of the Apple iPhone 16 is Rs 13,000 less than its original price. However, the price was lowered by Rs 10,000 to Rs 69,900 upon the release of the new iPhone 17. Customers are receiving a flat discount of Rs 3,000 as a result.
