  "text": "Vbot’s AI Robot Dog Sells 1,000 Units in 52 Minutes, Signaling Breakthrough for Consumer Embodied Intelligence\nWant to read in a language you're more familiar with?\nVita Dynamics' AI-powered robot dog, priced at $1,368, sold over 1,000 units within 52 minutes of launch, setting a sales record for consumer embodied intelligence products. The device's autonomous capabilities, driven by 128 TOPS of on-device AI, signal a key validation for the mass-market potential of household robotic companions.\nVita Dynamics (Vbot)’s newly launched AI-powered robot dog saw explosive early demand following its December 23 product launch. Orders surpassed 1,000 units within just 52 minutes of going live on the company’s official mini-program, setting a new record for five-figure-priced embodied AI products reaching four-digit sales volumes. Related topics climbed to No. 7 on Weibo’s trending list within five hours, while total livestream viewership exceeded 10 million.\nDeveloped by Vita Dynamics (Vbot), the robot dog is positioned as a fully autonomous household companion, requiring no remote control. Priced at RMB 9,988 (approx. 1,368 USD) under an early-bird offer, the product aims to bring high-performance robot dogs—previously priced near RMB 90,000(approx. 1,283 USD) —into the mass consumer market.\nThe device delivers 128 TOPS of on-device AI compute, integrates LiDAR and depth vision, and processes all visual data locally to ensure user privacy. It uses Vbot’s self-developed N45 high-torque permanent-magnet joint motors, offering 24.5 Nm peak torque, the ability to tow up to 100 kg, and a battery life of roughly five hours, with support for wireless charging and 240W USB-C fast charging.\nVbot’s founding team includes veterans from Horizon Robotics and Li Auto. Founder Yu Yinan said the product borrows heavily from smart EV architecture, equipping the robot dog with both a “spatial intelligence system” (akin to autonomous driving) and an “interactive cockpit” (human–machine interaction). Public beta testing is scheduled for January 2026, with batch deliveries beginning in March, and the early sales performance is widely viewed as a key validation moment for consumer-grade embodied intelligence.\nSource : GEEKPARK",
