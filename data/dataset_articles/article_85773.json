  "text": "Is the BYD Sealion 6 DM-i plug-in hybrid the best of both worlds?\nBYD’s first plug-in hybrid to be sold locally offers fantastic range and practicality.\nBy Kenny Yeo -\nNote: This review was first published on 13 November 2025.\nCharging is probably the biggest issue that is keeping some drivers from committing to an electric car. Driving is a deeply personal activity, and some drivers either don’t have easy access to a charger or they don’t want to deal with the charging times associated with electric cars. BYD is attempting to address these users with the Sealion 6 DM-i, a plug-in hybrid that, on paper, seems to offer the best of both worlds. I took it for a spin over the weekend to see if that’s really the case.\nStyling\nThere’s no question that the Sealion 6 shares styling cues with its all-electric sibling, the Sealion 7. To my eyes, the Sealion 6 DM-i looks more slender. This is confirmed by taking a glance at their spec sheets and looking at their dimensions. The Sealion 6 is a tad shorter and narrower. Some would say it’s a handsome car, which I agree, but then there’s also something slightly generic about the way it looks. Nothing about it stands out, which I suppose is a good thing if you want to blend into traffic and not draw too much attention. Furthermore, it only comes in four colours (Delan Black, Harbour Grey, Arctic White, and Stone Grey) and they are a little bland.\nPracticality\nThe Sealion 6 is a mid-size SUV that is roughly the size of a Tesla Model Y or Toyota Harrier. For most families, space should not be an issue. Rear leg and head room are good. I’m 1.8 metres and I can sit in the back comfortably, even with the front seat in my driving position. The boot is of a decent size, even if it’s not quite as big as some of its rivals. It’ll more than suffice for road trips up north. And if you need more room, you can always fold the rear seats down. With the seats down, the carrying capacity expands from 425L to 1,440L.\nBecause the Sealion 6 is based on an older model in China, the interior is a bit more conventional than its newer siblings. Some might say it looks a bit dated, but I say it’s functional. For example, you still have buttons on the centre console and a gear knob. The aircon vents are also manually adjusted, which are much more straightforward to use than some models which rely on the infotainment display for adjustment.\nSpeaking of which, the infotainment display is 15.6 inches, and like most other BYD cars, it can rotate to be used in a portrait orientation. I didn’t find that to be useful since I rely on Apple CarPlay, which can only be used in a landscape orientation. The car also supports wireless Android Auto. The front seats are ventilated, which is great for our torrid weather. On the whole, the Sealion 6 is well-equipped, and the only feature I wish it had was a heads-up display.\nHow does it perform?\nThe main reason why anyone might want a Sealion 6 is because it’s a plug-in hybrid. The DM-i in its name stands for “dual mode intelligent” and it refers to its hybrid powertrain, which consists of a 195hp electric motor and a 96hp 1.5-litre naturally-aspirated 4-cylinder engine. However, the combined maximum output is 215hp. The electric motor is powered by a small 18.3kWh battery, which is good for around 80km. The motor burns petrol from a 60L fuel tank. Together, BYD claims the system can provide 1,100km of range.\nLike most hybrids, the way the powertrain behaves is complex and dependent on the battery’s state of charge and the driver’s throttle input. The default behaviour, however, is for the car to rely on the battery and electric motor. So if driven normally and if the battery is sufficiently charged, the Sealion 6 will use as much of the battery’s energy as possible, with the motor kicking in only under heavy loads and to keep the battery’s charge level up. Once the battery falls under a certain level – which can be adjusted in the infotainment system – the motor will activate more frequently to provide both motive force and keep the battery charged.\nThis may sound complicated, but what you need to know is that as long as the battery is adequately charged, the Sealion 6 will drive like an EV. In other words, it feels preppy and it’s quiet. And even if the motor does kick in, it happens seamlessly. The only times I was ever aware it even had an internal combustion engine were when I floored the throttle to test its acceleration. It was only during those times that I could discern an audible hum from the bonnet.\nBYD claims 0-100km/h in 8.5 seconds, and that feels believable. However, its performance does appear to become more blunted if the battery is low on juice, which makes sense because it has to conserve charge, and the motor has to shuffle between providing motive force and charge to the battery. At any rate, the Sealion 6 isn’t a car that will set your pants on fire, but it is powerful enough for its size and for our roads.\nFor a car that’s ostensibly targeted at families, the ride is on the firmer side. It’s never uncomfortable, but those used to cushier riding cars might need some time to adjust. The upside is that body control is good and the Sealion 6 is a keener handling car than its specifications and looks might suggest. Personally, I think it’s well-judged and appreciate the extra firmness and control. The steering is passable. It’s light and vague, and even in the Sports mode, it doesn’t provide enough precision or give enough feedback.\nHow efficient is it?\nBYD claims the Sealion 6, with its battery and fuel tank, has a total range of 1,100km. I didn’t manage to travel that far during my weekend with the car. However, I did manage to travel about 500km, and when I returned the car, the trip computer said it had around 24% of charge, half a tank of fuel, and a range of 510km.\nBecause it’s powered by a mix of the electric motor and internal combustion engine, and the rate at which they contribute varies depending on a number of conditions, it’s hard to give a combined fuel efficiency figure. However, I noted that the trip computer calculated its overall efficiency at 3.8kWh/100km and 4.7L/100km. These figures were derived from its total mileage, which was 4681km at the point when I returned the car.\nIn my time with the car, if it was mostly relying on battery power, its power consumption could rise to 9.1kWh/100km, while its fuel consumption could drop to just 2.8L/100km. Likewise, if it was running low on battery, I saw its power consumption drop to 2.8kWh/100km, while its fuel consumption increased to 6.8L/100km.\nEven if the Sealion 6 cannot match BYD’s claims, there’s no denying that it’s a leggy car with impressive range. With the sort of economy I got during my test, a full charge and tank of petrol is more than enough to get you from anywhere in Singapore to Genting Highlands and back.\nBecause the battery is just 18.3kWh, charging is a fairly brisk affair. Even with a slow 7kW AC charger, you should be able to get a full charge in just under three hours. The maximum DC charging rate is 18kW, so an hour or so will suffice with a DC charger.\nFinal thoughts\nUnless you have access to a personal charger and only drive in Singapore, it’s likely that switching to an EV would require a change in lifestyle. Therefore, plug-in hybrids are a sensible middle ground for drivers who are EV-curious but are perhaps unsure if it’s right for them. If driven sensibly and charged frequently, it is entirely possible to use the Sealion 6 as a pure EV. And if you need the extra range, there’s no need to worry since there’s the engine to fall back on. Crucially, it means buyers don’t have to change their lifestyle to suit the car.\nComparisons will inevitably be made with mild hybrids like the Toyota Prius or Hyundai Kona Hybrid. These hybrids are different in that they cannot be charged using a charging station and often cannot run on battery alone. Even though mild hybrids could be even more economical to run on a daily basis, they cannot offer a pure EV driving experience like the Sealion 6 can. Furthermore, BYD backs its cars up with a 10-year warranty on its batteries and 10 years of free servicing.\nOverall, the Sealion 6 is a car that will appeal to drivers seeking practicality. It’s large, spacious, and offers impressive economy. You could run it as a pure EV, or you could use it like a traditional ICE car and get remarkable fuel efficiency. Furthermore, there are only a handful of plug-in hybrids currently on the market, and the Sealion 6 happens to be one of the more affordable ones. If you think a plug-in hybrid would be the right type of car for you, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t pay BYD a visit and have a test drive.\nAvailability and pricing\nThe BYD Sealion 6 DM-i is available now and prices start at S$219,388.
