  "text": "A breathtaking sight was witnessed in Navi Mumbai when 1,515 drones lit up the city’s skies on the eve of the operational opening of the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA). The event took place on December 24, 2025. The 1,515 drones synchronized perfectly to create breathtaking visuals of 3D lotus formations, Lotus formations in the airport terminals, the formation of the NMIA logo, “Green Airport,” an aircraft flying above Mumbai, and “Rise of India.”\nThe Drone Show, organized last night, transformed the evening sky into a living painting, leaving audiences in awe. The perfect synchronization and accuracy showcased India’s capabilities in cutting-edge technology and creative design. Unfolding through each pattern, they drew a picture of how NMIA stands out as a modern and sustainable gateway and is intended to act as a global aviation hub, but remains Indian at heart.\nMaking the event even more historic and special was the fact that it was attended by a diverse segment of people who got to witness it firsthand. Specially abled people, young athletes, and NMIA employees were among the people who were in attendance as the event made it a point to reach out to the community and touch as many lives as possible.\nIt highlighted the fact that the NMIA’s commitment is not only in terms of developing its infrastructure but also in terms of its people who would be using it and getting inspired by its growth as well.\nThe drone show also represented the starting point in the operational journey that NMIA will take in its future years. The airport is on the verge of handling its inaugural flights as it opens its gates in India’s sky.",
