  "text": "RUIDOSO, N.M. — Recent rains and cooler weather are helping more than 1,000 firefighters gain ground on two wildfires in southern New Mexico on Saturday that have killed two people, destroyed hundreds of homes and forced thousands to flee.\nFire crews took advantage of temperatures in the 70s, scattered showers and light winds to use bulldozers to dig protective lines while hand crews used shovels in more rugged terrain to battle the fires near the mountain village of Ruidoso.\nThe South Fork fire, which reached 26 square miles, was 26% contained, while the Salt Fire, at 12 square miles, was 7% contained as of Saturday morning, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\nAdvertisement Full containment was not expected until July 15, according to the agency.\nWorld & Nation\nMiscalculations, errors blamed for massive New Mexico blaze Miscalculations, inaccurate models and underestimation of dry conditions turned a controlled burn into New Mexico’s largest wildfire ever recorded.\nJune 21, 2022\nElsewhere in New Mexico, heavy rain and flash flood warnings prompted officials to order some mandatory evacuations Friday in the city of Las Vegas, N.M., and communities near Albuquerque, about 200 miles north of Ruidoso. Las Vegas set up shelters for displaced residents, and some evacuation orders remained in place there Saturday.\nFlash flood warnings were canceled Saturday, though the National Weather Service said afternoon storms could produce excessive runoff and more flooding in the area.\nThe wildfires have destroyed or damaged an estimated 1,400 structures. Other fallout from the fires — including downed power lines, damaged water, sewer and gas lines, flooding in burn scars — continued “to pose risks to firefighters and the public,” according to a Saturday update from the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department.\nEvacuations in areas near Ruidoso and road closures were still in effect. In Ruidoso, full-time residents will be allowed to return Monday, though everyday life won’t return to normal.\n“You’re going to need to bring a week’s worth of food, you’re going to need to bring drinking water,” Mayor Lynn Crawford said on Facebook.\nWorld & Nation\nU.S. Forest Service burn started wildfire that nearly reached Los Alamos, N.M., agency says The U.S. Forest Service says its own prescribed burn started a 2022 wildfire that nearly burned into Los Alamos, New Mexico.\nJuly 24, 2023\nDeanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham were scheduled to tour the disaster area Saturday.\nAdvertisement President Biden issued a disaster declaration for parts of southern New Mexico on Thursday, freeing up funding and more resources to help with recovery efforts including temporary housing, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property and other emergency work in Lincoln County and on lands belonging to the Mescalero Apache tribe.\nMuch of the Southwest has been exceedingly dry and hot in recent months. Those conditions, along with strong wind, whipped the flames out of control, rapidly advancing the South Fork fire into Ruidoso in a matter of hours. Evacuations extended to hundreds of homes, businesses, a regional medical center and the Ruidoso Downs horse track.\nNationwide, wildfires have scorched more than 3,344 square miles this year — a figure higher than the 10-year average, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\nMore to Read\nEvacuation orders lifted for some Arizona residents forced from their homes by a wildfire June 30, 2024\nArizona wildfire advances after forcing evacuations near Phoenix June 29, 2024\nFBI offers reward for information about deadly southern New Mexico fires June 23, 2024\nWorld & Nation Fires",
