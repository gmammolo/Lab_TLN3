  "text": "Breaking: Xiaomi unveils EMG-enabled smartwatch and Buds 6 with lossless audio and real-time translation\nIn a move spotlighting health-first wearables, Xiaomi announced a fresh lineup that pairs premium hardware with advanced health analytics. Teh highlight is a smartwatch rumored too include an electromyography (EMG) sensor, alongside a new generation of Buds with lossless wireless audio and live-language translation.\nSmartwatch introduces EMG sensor for muscle activity\nGoing beyond the familiar heart-rate and ECG capabilities, the upcoming watch is said to feature EMG – a technology that measures the electrical activity produced by muscles. In medical practice, EMG helps diagnose nerve and muscle conditions, but Xiaomi appears to be positioning the sensor as a tool for sports analysis and training optimization. The company has yet to disclose exact workings or the concrete benefits for everyday users, but the inclusion signals an emphasis on performance monitoring that goes deeper than typical wearables.\nDetails on how the EMG function will operate in practice remain scant.The feature is not commonly found in consumer smartwatches, which could make it a standout draw for power users and fitness enthusiasts.\nDisclaimer: Health-related features are promotional claims. Consult a healthcare professional for medical interpretation.\n- Context on EMG technology:\nMayo Clinic EMG overview - industry perspective on EMG wearables:\nIEEE spectrum on EMG wearables\nBuds 6: lossless sound and on-the-fly translation\nThe new Buds 6 continue Xiaomi’s premium audio trajectory, delivering lossless wireless transmission for uncompromised sound. Real-time AI translation is also highlighted, following a trend already seen in some flagship headphones, and aimed at users who value seamless multilingual communication.\nAccording to official teasers, Buds 6 will launch in three colors: black, white, and pink. While active noise cancellation is not explicitly named in the teasers, it’s a staple feature for high-end wireless earbuds and is expected to be included.\nEurope’s timeline: spring wait anticipated\nChinese buyers are expected to place orders shortly after the Christmas unveiling, but European availability remains unconfirmed. Based on Xiaomi’s prior patterns,a global rollout may coincide with major tech events,potentially around the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in early March.\nImplications for the wearables market\nbeyond glossy finishes, Xiaomi appears to be pushing a health analytics-forward approach in its consumer devices. The EMG sensor could expand at-home performance monitoring,while Buds 6 with lossless audio and translation features may benefit travelers,multilingual teams,and fitness enthusiasts seeking deeper insights and convenience.\n| Product | Key Feature | Availability | Colors |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Smartwatch | EMG sensor for muscle activity;
