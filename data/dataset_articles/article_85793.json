  "text": "If 2025 proved anything, it’s this: the best seat in photography is officially in the sky. This year’s award-winning drone photos didn’t just show us the world from above—they flipped our perspective upside down and made us feel small in the best possible way. From icy coastlines and sun-scorched deserts to chaotic cities that suddenly look like abstract art, these 36 images ruled international photography competitions for a reason.\nWhat separates 2025 from previous years is confidence. Drone photographers stopped chasing gimmicks and leaned hard into storytelling. Judges across major global competitions rewarded images that blended clean composition, bold geometry, and emotional punch. These weren’t just technically perfect shots—they had soul. A lone boat cutting through black water. Crowds moving like brushstrokes. Farmlands turning into patchwork poetry.\nYou can feel the evolution in every frame. Pilots flew lower, waited longer, and trusted negative space. Shadows became subjects. Patterns became narratives. Some photos stunned with symmetry so sharp it felt unreal, while others embraced chaos—waves crashing, traffic flowing, humans shrinking into dots of color. It’s aerial photography growing up, flexing restraint instead of excess.\nWhat really hits home is how global this collection feels. Winners came from every corner of the planet, proving that creativity isn’t limited by borders—just altitude. Whether captured over bustling megacities or silent natural landscapes, these drone photos show how much beauty hides in plain sight once you rise above it.\nThese 36 award-winning images didn’t just win trophies—they reset expectations. They remind us that drone photography isn’t about flying higher anymore. It’s about seeing deeper.\n#1. 35 Awards Drone Winners: “The geometry of nature” by Mikhail Kharitonychev\n#2. 35 Awards Drone Winners: “Harvesting water lilies” by Tuấn Nguyễn Tấn\n#3. 35 Awards Drone Winners: “Falling Leaves Season on Tuyen Lam Lake” by Tran Phuong\n#4. 35 Awards Drone Winners: “Beach” by Alina Yantsen\n#5. 35 Awards Drone Winners: “Surfing” by Lekontsev\nMaster Light Like a Cinematographer\n- Fly during golden hour for long, dramatic shadows\n- Avoid harsh midday light unless shooting patterns or textures\n- Use clouds as natural diffusers for soft contrast\n- Watch how light shapes land, water, and buildings\n- Plan flights based on sun direction, not just location\n#6. 35 Awards Drone Winners: “Daisy garden” by Tuấn Nguyễn Tấn\n#7.
