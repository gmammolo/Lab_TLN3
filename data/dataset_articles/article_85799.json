If this partnership translates into credible traction in data center projects, it could complement the Nexis platform rollout as a catalyst that gradually reshapes investor expectations around growth and diversification.\nHowever, against this improving cash flow story, investors should also be aware of the ongoing risk that SolarEdge’s still‑sizeable net losses and volatile share price could...\nRead the full narrative on SolarEdge Technologies (it's free!)\nSolarEdge Technologies' narrative projects $1.6 billion revenue and $11.8 million earnings by 2028.
