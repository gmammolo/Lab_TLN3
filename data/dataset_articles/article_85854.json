  "text": "Samsung is seeking to strengthen its long-term manufacturing strategy in India by expanding component production and reinforcing export-led growth, rather than relocating facilities from other geographies, as per The Economic Times report.\nThe company has applied under the production-linked incentive scheme for components to manufacture mobile phone displays domestically. The move signals a shift towards higher value-added manufacturing within India’s electronics ecosystem, as Samsung looks to reduce dependence on imported components and deepen localisation.\nIn parallel, Samsung has approached the government for additional time under the smartphone PLI programme, which has recently concluded. The company is also understood to be engaging with policymakers on the possibility of incentives continuing under a future phase of the scheme.\nJB Park, president and CEO of Samsung’s Southwest Asia region, said the company views India as a critical technology and manufacturing base.\nHe indicated that discussions with the government are ongoing to support sustained investments, exports and component manufacturing as part of Samsung’s India strategy.\nRead More: Google to Scale Up Green Card Sponsorship for Employees in 2026; New Eligibility Guidelines Released!\nSamsung’s focus on local display manufacturing and continued engagement on PLI incentives underscores its intent to anchor long-term production and exports from India. The approach aligns with the government’s push for deeper electronics manufacturing and positions India as a central node in Samsung’s global supply chain.\nDisclaimer: This blog has been written exclusively for educational purposes.
