  "text": "Jabil (JBL) Valuation Check After Raised Outlook and AI-Driven Growth Momentum Simply Wall St Thu, 25 December 2025 at 7:08 am GMT+2 2 min read\nIn this article: JBL\nJabil (JBL) just delivered a fourth quarter that lined up with expectations, but the mix under the hood is what matters, especially the momentum in Intelligent Infrastructure and management’s decision to lift full year revenue and EPS guidance.\nSee our latest analysis for Jabil.\nThe upbeat guidance seems to be feeding into an already strong trend, with the stock’s 18.94% 1 month share price return adding to a 64.17% year to date gain and a 5 year total shareholder return of 465.07%. This suggests momentum is still building rather than fading.\nIf Jabil’s run has you thinking about what else could benefit from similar themes in tech and automation, this is a good moment to explore fast growing stocks with high insider ownership .\nWith earnings trending higher, a raised revenue outlook, and shares still sitting below the average analyst target, the big question now is whether Jabil remains undervalued or if the market has already priced in its next leg of growth.\nMost Popular Narrative Narrative: 9.6% Undervalued With Jabil last closing at 234.49 dollars against a narrative fair value of 259.25 dollars, the story points to more upside if its assumptions hold.\nStrong demand in AI related markets, with expected revenue growth of 40% year on year, indicates significant potential to drive future revenue and improve operating margins through an expanded share of high growth technology sectors. The anticipated 1.2 billion dollars in free cash flow generation suggests sound financial health, providing flexibility for share buybacks or strategic investments to further enhance earnings per share growth.\nRead the complete narrative.\nCurious how steady mid single digit revenue growth, fatter margins, shrinking share count, and a lower future earnings multiple still add up to that valuation? The narrative connects these moving parts into one ambitious earnings path. Want to see exactly how those levers combine to justify the gap to fair value? Read on to unpack the full playbook behind this price target.\nResult: Fair Value of $259.25 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, softness in EV and renewable demand, along with tariff uncertainty across key trade corridors, could easily derail those earnings and margin ambitions.\nFind out about the key risks to this Jabil narrative.\nBuild Your Own Jabil Narrative If you see the outlook differently or would rather dig through the numbers yourself, you can build a tailored view in just minutes: Do it your way .\nA great starting point for your Jabil research is our analysis highlighting 2 key rewards and 4 important warning signs that could impact your investment decision.\n繼續閱讀 Looking for more investment ideas? Before you move on, lock in fresh opportunities by using the Simply Wall St Screener to uncover focused stock ideas that match your strategy and risk appetite.\nBoost your hunt for overlooked value by targeting companies trading below their cash flow potential through these 904 undervalued stocks based on cash flows .\nCapitalize on transformative innovation by zeroing in on growth names riding the AI wave with these 24 AI penny stocks .\nStrengthen your income game by filtering for reliable payers using these 10 dividend stocks with yields > 3% .\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.
