  "text": "Most people think real AI needs a data center and a massive budget.\nThey're overthinking it.\nHere's what actually works ↓\nI’ve realized the most dangerous shift in AI isn’t happening in the cloud.\nIt’s happening in your pocket.\nOr on your desk.\nOr in your fridge.\nTiny models running locally are getting scary good.\nWe’re talking a few billion parameters.\nRunning on a Raspberry Pi, a laptop, even embedded in devices.\nThey can chat.\nThey can reason.\nThey can see images.\nThey can call tools.\nThey can summarize long documents, read code, and even work with video.\nAll without sending data to a server.\nI tested a local setup on a cheap device.\nZero GPU.\nNo subscription.\nIt handled a 50-page doc, wrote code stubs, and answered follow-up questions in seconds.\nIt wasn’t perfect.\nBut it was private, fast, and always on.\n↓ Here’s the simple framework I’d use if I were you:\n• Start: Pick one workflow you run weekly that’s boring but repeatable.\n• Plug in: Try a small local model (on a laptop or mini PC) just for that workflow.\n• Iterate: Measure time saved, errors reduced, and how often you reuse it.\n↳ If it saves you 2–3 hours a week, scale it to your team.\nThis isn’t a toy anymore.\nIt’s a pocket superpower hiding in plain sight.\nWhat’s stopping you from testing a tiny local AI model in the next 7 days?",
