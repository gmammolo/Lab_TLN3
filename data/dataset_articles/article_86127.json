  "text": "Meet the IIT Madras professor who won national award for his hospital on wheels\nIIT Madras Professor Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam has won the Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar 2025 in the Vigyan Yuva category for his pioneering work in affordable medical devices and brain mapping.\nIn the heart of a nation striving for affordable and equitable healthcare, where millions still battle blindness, heart risks, and inaccessible surgery, one quiet pioneer is turning engineering into acts of profound kindness.\nProfessor Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam, director of the Healthcare Technology Innovation Centre and the Sudha Gopalakrishnan Brain Centre at IIT Madras, has been awarded the prestigious Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar 2025 in the Vigyan Yuva-Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar category for Technology and Innovation.\nWHAT THIS AWARD TRULY SIGNIFIES\nIn an exclusive interview with India Today, Professor Sivaprakasam shared its deeper meaning.\n\"I see this as essentially a recognition of the fact that we have been able to demonstrate that you can do really cutting-edge research and development in India, which can be translated into real-world technologies and commercial products that can be manufactured as indigenous products in the country,\" he told IndiaToday.in.\nIt challenges outdated views of academia. \"Very often we think of academia as a conservative place that does work inside its own lab,\" he reflected.\nCollaboration fuels everything. \"They realise the kind of work we do, it is highly collaborative. We work with hospitals, doctors, industry, biologists, and international collaborators,\" he explained.\nIt sparks hope for the future. \"It is definitely an inspiration for people, especially those wanting to use technologies that are focused on developing products that are indigenously available in India. Essentially, indigenous technologies will lead to commercial success because India needs that a lot these days.\"\nHis centres have delivered projects worth 300 to 400 crore over 15 years. \"It started with the government, and today we get more than 60 to 70 per cent of our funding from private sources, be it industry or private philanthropy,\" he revealed.\n\"That is another acknowledgement that you can do models of research and development and science which you can amplify beyond government funding using private resources.\"\nThe Brain Centre started with government funds but now thrives on private support. \"And obviously all this is a big inspiration, not just for the researchers, but also for the funding sources.\"\nRETURNING HOME WITH A MISSION\nHe left the United States in 2008, forgoing a faculty position. \"I was doing some really cutting-edge research and development work in the US, and in 2008, I decided to return to India,\" he recalled.\n\"I was always clear that this is where I started and this is where I will contribute to making impactful work.\"\nIIT Madras embraced translation. India's heavy reliance on imports, with bills soaring from 35,000 crore to over one lakh crore, became his driving force. \"What could be a better motivation,\" he stressed.\nProfessor Sivaprakasam's innovations encompass the Mobile Eye Surgical Unit for rural cataract surgery, Eye PAC for cost-effective adult and neonatal ophthalmic screening, and VITALSENS clinical-grade wearables for fever and cardiovascular monitoring.\nAmong other innovations are the Insight indigenous bronchoscopy processor, SmartEye endoscopy platform, disposable ureteroscope reducing costs and infections, DISHA X robotic spine surgery system, ARTSENS image-free vascular ultrasound, a machine learning decarbonisation framework for healthcare, and groundbreaking cellular-resolution 3D human brain atlases including the DHARANI foetal atlas at the Sudha Gopalakrishnan Brain Centre.\nBRINGING SURGERY TO FORGOTTEN VILLAGES\nThe Mobile Eye Surgical Unit transforms a truck into a sterile operating theatre for cataract surgery in remote areas, and is also known as the 'Hospital on Wheels' model.\nIndia's first Ministry-approved out-of-hospital model, it has restored sight through over 30,000 surgeries in 225 rural sites over 14 years, without a single adverse event.\nSterility relies on precise measurements. \"There are many key elements to keep it sterile: sterile water, sterile air, the vibration of the overall unit itself. The way we do that is we measure all these.\"\nDesign safeguards every step. \"At no point of time is the operating area compromised in terms of sterility.\"\nBuilt-in intelligence monitors constantly. \"The way we actually build intelligence into the system, and the way we actually measure and monitor determine how sterility is maintained.\"\nEven the basics are engineered. \"How do you move the patient? How do you move the instrument? How do you supply air? How do you supply power? All of this is done in a very constrained environment, unlike a land-based hospital. And those are the ones that make the mobile surgical unit sterile and high quality.\"\nThe Mobile Eye Surgical Unit is now scaling across states.\nAI POWERED EYE SCREENING FOR MILLIONS\nEye PAC harnesses intelligent image computing to slash costs five times against imports.\nAdult devices operate in 2,900 sites across 40 countries, conducting 12 million exams for diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration.\nNeonatal versions have screened over 8,00,000 newborns in 45 countries for retinopathy of prematurity.\n\"The primary reason we are able to bring down the cost is that we have an intelligent system,\" he said.\nAlgorithms blend data and clever design. \"You have so much intelligence built into the system, which is based on the data collected and also some really practical and intelligent algorithms that do first-order detection.\"\nEarly intervention saves fortunes. \"These algorithms are able to detect and threshold it at a much earlier stage, and as a result, you are able to save enormous healthcare costs before it becomes too expensive, or before it becomes irreversible.\"\nTRUSTWORTHY WEARABLES FOR REAL HEALTH\nVITALSENS elevates wearables to clinical standards.\n\"Normally, when you look at wearables, they are used for hobbies and non-serious matters,\" he contrasted.\nRooted in physics and physiology, it spawned a fever monitor scaling nationwide after Tamil Nadu pilots for vulnerable newborns, and a cardiovascular device with 500 units poised for 10 to 20 times growth in patient recovery, athlete fitness, and stress assessment.\n\"The algorithms that we have built are based on physics and physiology, which require research,\" he explained.\nSMART CHECK FOR HIDDEN ARTERY RISKS\nARTSENS delivers image-free ultrasound to measure all early vascular ageing markers in one test, at a 20 times lower cost.\n\"We do this through deep mathematical modelling involving the underlying physiology of the artery and the circulation, and we develop algorithms using these physiological models and then implement these algorithms into a computing system,\" he explained.\n\"By doing this, we remove the complexity of having an image through which the expert has to interpret. So, compared to a normal imaging system which will cost you tens of lakhs, we are able to bring down this cost to 1/10th or 1/20th of it because there is no image.\"\nReflected waves reveal details. \"It is an ultrasound probe. The reflected ultrasound waves are mathematically modelled and then computed to determine the elasticity and the finer movements of the artery. With blood pressure, we can calculate the stiffness and that is how we are able to make ARTSENS work without the ultrasound imaging system which is normally used otherwise.\"\nValidated in 8,000 patients, it edges toward FDA approval and is licenced to VascRisk, a Virginia-based health-tech company.\nMORE INDIGENOUS WONDERS\nInsight delivers India's first homegrown high-definition bronchoscopy processor compatible with four procedures, reducing costs reliably.\n\"Typically, people use a fibre-based camera, and the fibre breaks. So we have used a different architecture, which is to put a CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) camera,\" he said.\nSwitching to a chip-based camera brings new challenges, such as slightly lower image quality, higher power consumption, and more heat generation inside the body.\nTo overcome these, the team designed innovative architectures that solve the problems while keeping costs low. They moved all the heavy processing to an external video processor outside the scope. This clever shift not only manages heat and power better but also opens the door to adding advanced intelligence, including digital enhancements and AI features, directly into the system.\nSmartEye, developed after seven years of effort, bridges the endoscopy import gap.\nThe disposable ureteroscope halves costs and infections to one per cent, ready for export. \"The constraint here is when you put a camera towards the tip of the urethra, there are a lot of engineering challenges,\" he said. \"The other aspect of it is when you have something tiny, the amount of light that falls is also small. There is a lot of image processing that you have to do to make sure that the quality of the image is very good.\"\nDISHA X marks India's first fully indigenous robotic spine surgery system, and is approved by the CDSCO (Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation).\nA decarbonisation machine learning framework guides hospitals toward sustainability.\n\"The machine learning system is fundamentally a self-learning system,\" he explained. \"By creating a machine learning framework, what we essentially do is let the machine learning intelligent system figure it out.\"\nPEERING INTO THE BRAIN LIKE NEVER BEFORE\nThe Sudha Gopalakrishnan Brain Centre crafts cellular-resolution 3D atlases of entire human brains, a global milestone drawing over 20 international collaborators.\nThe DHARANI foetal atlas boosts resolution 10 times and is freely shared, earning acclaim like an editorial \"India Gets a Seat at the Table of Human Brain Cartography\" in the Journal of Comparative Neurology.\n\"The reason we are able to obtain such a high resolution is because, instead of taking only portions of the brain and imaging them, we are imaging the entire brain by cutting it into sections of 20 microns each,\" he explained.\n\"For an adult brain, we cut it into about 10,000 sections, each about 20 micrometres thick. We do not use electron microscopes, because to do cell resolution, light microscopy is sufficient. We have created imaging microscopy and digital microscopy systems that can image an entire brain section in less than 30 minutes.\"\nA FUTURE FULL OF PROMISE\nIn five years, his vision targets 50 million patients annually through three affordable image-guided robotic systems, a heart preservation device that mimics natural pumping for better transplants, and products from over 20 startups.\nProfessor Sivaprakasam's journey proves that true innovation can be compassionate, indigenous, and world-changing.",
