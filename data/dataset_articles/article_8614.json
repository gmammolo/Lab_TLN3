  "text": "GULFPORT, Miss. (WLOX) - When emergency events take place, phone service could be dropped across the Coast. The Mississippi Coast Amateur Radio Association (MCARA) is prepared for that exact scenario. On Saturday, members of the MCARA practiced setting up and making communications as part of a field day. “We take time to share our knowledge and develop relationships in case you need them later on, perhaps in an emergency,” said MCARA coordinator Steven Harrison. Hurricanes are an example of when ham radio communication is critical. “If you remember Hurricane Katrina, I was on my roof with my cell phone holding it up in the air trying to get in touch with anybody,” explains Harrison. “With ham radio, all you have to do is pull your radio out and call, and a group like this is going to have somebody listening.” Other groups like this around the country are also taking part in the 24-hour field day activity to make as many contacts as possible. “We’ve made contacts so far with groups in Oklahoma, Texas, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and as far as Oregon,” Harrison said. While radio communication can be important in an emergency, it’s also a fun hobby. “Ham radio is communicating not using your telephone or wires and radio frequencies,” said Harrison. “When you were younger, you might have used walkie-talkies too. Ham radio is for people who want to buy more capable, probably more expensive walkie-talkies. It’s fun to be able to do that and say, ‘Yeah, I can talk to the world.’” The field day event continues until Sunday afternoon.
