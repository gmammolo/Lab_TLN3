  "text": "By Brad Matthews ,\n11 hours ago\nA Foreman Creek, California, man was rescued alive from a wooded area not far from the town earlier this week after being missing since June 11.\nBefore being found Thursday, Lukas McClish, 34, had last been seen on June 11 walking on a road in Boulder Creek, which is near Big Basin Redwoods State Park. His family reported him missing on Sunday, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) San Mateo-Santa Cruz Unit posted on Facebook.\nAt around 3 p.m. local time Thursday, a bystander heard someone yelling for help in the area of Foreman Creek, not far from California State Route 236.\nLocal law enforcement used drones to find Mr. McClish, and California State Parks personnel were the first to reach him, with state and local fire personnel helping him to safety, the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post.\nMr. McClish was found in a remote canyon below the community of Braemoor, California.\n“There are no trails, no roads, several miles from the closest place to a road, which the closest road that we got into, we had to four-wheel drive probably a quarter of a mile in and then we couldn’t go further,” Boulder Creek Fire Protection District Chief Mark Bingham told the Santa Cruz Sentinel.\nMr. McClish had no major injuries and has been reunited with his family, SCSO said . He managed to forage for sustenance in the time he was missing.\n“About 10 days he survived in the wilderness, essentially, drinking out of the creek and eating wild berries. He did have a minor injury … but, for the most part, he was disoriented and lost and surviving off of the land, which is pretty impressive,” District Chief Mark Bingham told the Santa Cruz Sentinel.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
