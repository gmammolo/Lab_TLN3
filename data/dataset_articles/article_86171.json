  "text": "By Sourav Chakraborty ,\n1 hours ago Photo Credit: Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images In the race to make Artificial Intelligence (AI) interactions more and more coherent with human interactions, ChatGPT has now added a feature that allows users to tweak the chatbot’s warmth, enthusiasm, and emoji use , according to a new social media post. This will give users further control over how the chatbot reacts to questions and tasks.\nYou can now adjust ChatGPT’s enthusiasm level Users can now adjust ChatGPT’s enthusiasm and warmth levels, according to a recent post by OpenAI. In a social media post, OpenAI posted on X about the new feature and where to find it. The post read, “You can now adjust specific characteristics in ChatGPT, like warmth, enthusiasm, and emoji use. Now available in your “Personalization” settings.”\nThis means that ChatGPT’s interaction with users will now be even more human-like, with the users getting to choose what tone they prefer. These options now appear in the Personalization menu and can be set to More, Less, or Default. They appear on the menu alongside other customizable options like ChatGPT’s headers and lists.\nThis new set of abilities will function on top of the existing “base style and tone.” OpenAI added tones like Professional, Candid, and Quirky in November 2025.\nChatGPT’s tone has been a frequent topic of discussion over the past year. OpenAI previously rolled back an update due to concerns about excessive agreeableness. The company later adjusted GPT-5 to make it warmer after users reported that it felt overly cold.\nThe expanded tone options arrive amid broader concerns about AI sycophancy. Experts have warned that constant affirmation from AI systems could have negative effects, including the risk of emotional dependence.\nThe move has received mixed reactions from users. Some users praised it. For instance, one user wrote , “This is a game changer! Customizing tone will be huge for educators and content creators. Looking forward to seeing how far the personalization can go.” Highlighting the potential concerns, another user wrote , “This is like customizing a virtual personality for your digital butler, except instead of fetching tea, it’s generating existential dread at 3 am.”\nThe post ChatGPT Now Lets Users Tune Warmth, Enthusiasm & Emojis appeared first on Mandatory .",
