  "text": "1 Reason I Am Buying Taiwan Semiconductor Stock to Hold Forever\nStefon Walters| December 25, 2025, 1:37 AM\nKey Points\nTSMC's foundry models allow it to manufacture specialized chips that tech companies design themselves.\nTSMC has a virtual monopoly on artificial intelligence (AI) chip manufacturing.\nA dominant market position has given TSMC pricing power that has improved its margins.\nIf you look around your house, you'll likely see a smartphone, TV, laptop, tablet (especially if you have young kids), gaming console, or even smart appliances. One thing all those items have in common is that they rely on semiconductors (chips) to function properly.\nIf you dig deeper into what those chips have in common, they were likely manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (TSMC). TSMC is by far the world's leading chip manufacturer, and that's the reason why I'm loading up on the stock to hold forever.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »\nImage source: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\nMuch of the physical tech world begins with TSMC\nTSMC operates on the foundry model. Instead of manufacturing chips for general sale, it manufactures chips on order to meet the specific needs of other companies.\nFor example, Apple would design the chips it needs for its latest iPhone, Nvidia designs the chips for its GPUs, and Amazon will design chips for its cloud servers. In all those situations, TSMC is often the company that brings these blueprints to physical life.\nManufacturing chips with the precision, reliability, and consistency of TSMC isn't easy for even the most tech-forward companies in the world. It requires tens of billions of dollars in investment, tons of specialized engineers, and world-class plants, which is why companies would rather rely on TSMC to do it than make the investments to build their own (less effective) plants or spend on the engineering talent.\nA monopoly on AI chips\nWhen it comes to manufacturing chips for items like smartphones or computers, TSMC holds a commanding market share. However, when it comes to manufacturing artificial intelligence (AI) chips, TSMC is essentially the only game in town. Its market share is well into the upper-90% range.\nAs tech companies (especially hyperscalers) commit to spending more on building out their AI infrastructure, TSMC will be a natural beneficiary. It won't supply the systems that fills data centers, but it will undoubtedly supply the chips those machines we built around.\nThis reliance on TSMC has boded well for its finances in recent years, too. Its high-performance computing (HPC) segment, which includes its AI chips, accounted for 57% of its $33.1 billion in revenue in the third quarter.\nMaybe more noteworthy, though, is how TSMC's leadership position has given it pricing power that has strengthened its margins. In the third quarter, its gross margins increased from 57.8% to 59.5%, and its operating margins increased from 47.5% to 50.6%.\nRegardless of how beneficial AI chips have been to TSMC's business over the past couple of years, the company is far from dependent on them; they're just a massive plus.\nTSMC has a strongstrong foothold inmanufacturing for virtually all major tech companies, which makes it a stock I'm comfortable holding for the long haul.\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $504,239!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,159,896!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 985% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 195% for the S&P 500. Don't miss the latest top 10 list, available with Stock Advisor, and join an investing community built by individual investors for individual investors.\n*Stock Advisor returns as of December 25, 2025.\nStefon Walters has positions in Apple and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
