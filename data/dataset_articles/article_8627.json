  "text": "The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) have partnered to strengthen Vietnam’s capacities for managing infectious diseases, including COVID-19. According to a press release by UNICEF Vietnam on Friday, this support also aims to enhance cold chain systems for routine immunization and COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. As part of this effort, USAID and UNICEF have provided 680 patient vital sign monitors, 810 electronic syringe pumps, and 150 refrigerators to departments of health across nine provinces. The vital sign monitors and syringe pumps are being distributed to hospitals with the goal of increasing their ability to effectively monitor and treat patients suffering from infectious diseases. The vaccine refrigerators, which maintain the required temperature range of +2˚C to +8˚C for safe vaccine storage, will be distributed to commune health centers to ensure the availability of vaccines from the National Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) for community members. Launched in 1981, EPI provides free immunization against 12 vaccine-preventable diseases, namely tuberculosis, hepatitis B, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, Hib, measles, rubella, Japanese encephalitis, cholera, and typhoid. All the medical devices will empower healthcare professionals to provide timely and precise care, thereby improving patient outcomes. The departments of health receiving the equipment are serving communities in Thai Binh, Son La, Nghe An, Dong Thap, Soc Trang, Lai Chau, Dien Bien, Gia Lai, and Thai Nguyen Provinces. These locations have been identified as requiring additional support to cope with healthcare burdens associated with infectious diseases. This initiative is part of a broader effort by USAID and UNICEF to enhance global health security and strengthen healthcare systems in countries facing public health challenges. The provided medical equipment and cold chain supplies will provide long-term services, improving the resilience and preparedness of Vietnam's healthcare system. \"The U.S. government is proud to continue our strong collaboration with the government and people of Vietnam in jointly addressing the national and global challenge of infectious diseases,” Dr. Hany Helmy, deputy office director of the USAID/Vietnam Office of Health, said during a symbolic handover ceremony in Dong Thap on Friday. “The critical commodities provided by USAID through UNICEF will help Vietnam to strengthen the country's capacity to effectively monitor and treat patients suffering from infectious diseases, including COVID-19, and to further improve cold chain systems for routine immunization and COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.” Access to reliable medical equipment is essential for effective healthcare delivery, UNICEF Vietnam acting deputy representative Anjanette Saguisag added. “This contribution will significantly improve the capacity of hospitals at both national and sub-national levels to manage and treat infectious diseases, ensuring better health outcomes for children, women, and communities across Vietnam,\" Saguisag said. “With USAID’s support, UNICEF is pleased to work with the Ministry of Health and help strengthen its immunization systems, ensuring that families in remote areas have strengthened access to safe vaccines.” Meanwhile, Dr. Duong Duc Thien, deputy director of the Department of Planning and Finance, expressed the Vietnamese Ministry of Health’s appreciation to USAID and UNICEF “for the timely support from the government and people of the U.S., and from UNICEF in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.” “USAID and UNICEF are among the countries and organizations that have provided the most support to Vietnam, including COVID-19 vaccines/vaccination supplies, cold chain equipment for vaccination, treatment equipment, ventilators, vital sign monitors, liquid oxygen systems, etc., for hospitals, helping Vietnam to control and reduce COVID-19 mortality rates”, Thien said.
