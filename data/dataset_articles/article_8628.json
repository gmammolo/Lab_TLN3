  "text": "Recent rains and cooler weather are helping more than 1000 firefighters gain ground on two wildfires in southern New Mexico that have killed two people, destroyed hundreds of homes and forced thousands to flee.\nFire crews took advantage of temperatures in the 70s, scattered showers and light winds to use bulldozers to dig protective lines while hand crews used shovels in more rugged terrain to battle the fires near the mountain village of Ruidoso.\nThe South Fork Fire, which reached 67 square kilometres, was 26% contained, while the Salt Fire, at 31 square kilometres, was 7% contained as of Saturday morning, according to the National Interagency Fire Centre.\nFull containment was not expected until July 15, per the agency.\nElsewhere in New Mexico, heavy rain and flash flood warnings prompted officials to order some mandatory evacuations Friday in the city of Las Vegas, New Mexico, and communities near Albuquerque, about 320 kilometres north of Ruidoso. Las Vegas set up shelters for displaced residents, and some evacuation orders remained in place there on Saturday.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFlash flood warnings were cancelled Saturday, though the National Weather Service said afternoon storms could produce excessive runoff and more flooding in the area.\nThe wildfires have destroyed or damaged an estimated 1400 structures. Other fallout from the fires — including downed power lines, damaged water, sewer and gas lines, flooding in burn scars — continued “to pose risks to firefighters and the public,” according to a Saturday update from the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department.\nEvacuations in areas near Ruidoso and road closures were still in effect. In Ruidoso, full-time residents will be allowed to return Monday, though everyday life won’t return to normal.\n“You’re going to need to bring a week’s worth of food, you’re going to need to bring drinking water,” Mayor Lynn Crawford said on Facebook.\nPresident Joe Biden issued a disaster declaration for parts of southern New Mexico on Thursday, freeing up funding and more resources to help with recovery efforts including temporary housing, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property and other emergency work in Lincoln County and on lands belonging to the Mescalero Apache Tribe.\nDeanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, met with Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, Crawford and Mescalero Apache President Thora Walsh Padilla on Saturday. “These communities have our support for as long as it takes to recover,” Criswell posted on the social media platform X.\nMuch of the Southwest has been exceedingly dry and hot in recent months. Those conditions, along with strong wind, whipped the flames out of control, rapidly advancing the South Fork Fire into Ruidoso in a matter of hours. Evacuations extended to hundreds of homes, businesses, a regional medical centre and the Ruidoso Downs horse track.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNationwide, wildfires have scorched more than 8660 square kilometres this year — a figure higher than the 10-year average, according to the National Interagency Fire Centre.",
