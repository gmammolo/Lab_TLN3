  "text": "A Palm Bay man escaped a car fire on Monday and then ran into an inferno to save his pets. The home on Hallmark Street SE is a total loss, and the newly married couple is starting over from scratch. Blake Garrett’s BMW was parked in the garage, and he was sitting in the driver’s seat. When he tried to start it, he saw a flame spark from the hood, and the rest is history. The fire quickly engulfed the garage and spread to another car parked in the driveway. After Blake escaped the explosion, he didn’t run away from the fire. Instead, he ran inside to save what he could. “I was sitting in the driver’s seat when everything kicked off,” said Blake, showing FOX 35 around the home exclusively on Friday. He realizes days later how the flames could have been the end for him. “The only way I can explain it is a miracle, really. Five seconds more, and I wouldn’t be standing here today with you,” said Garrett. After narrowly missing death in the driveway, he put himself in danger again to save his three pets still trapped inside. CLICK HERE TO READ FULL ARTICLE ON FOX 35",
