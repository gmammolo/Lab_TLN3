  "text": "Voibe is an offline voice dictation app for macOS that lets you write at the speed of thought. It works everywhere (Mail, Notes, Browsers, Slack, VS Code, ChatGPT, etc.), making it easy to draft messages, capture ideas, and produce long content without breaking concentration. Unlike cloud dictation tools, Voibe runs fully on device using a local Whisper model. Your audio does not get uploaded, so private work stays local and dictation keeps working offline without any internet dependency. The experience is built for low latency, so words appear quickly while you talk and you spend less time waiting and correcting. How it works 1. Click into the editor you want to type 2. Just hold your favorite hotkey and speak naturally 3. Release the hotkey and your words appear instantly on the editor you are on. Key features - On device speech to text using a local Whisper model - Works across all apps on your mac - Near real-time transcription to keep you in your flow - Custom dictionary for names, acronyms, and domain terms - Cursor and VS Code integration for workspace aware file and folder names Benefits - Write about 3 times faster than typing. - Single hotkey for all apps to keep you in the flow. - Protect sensitive work since voice stays on device - Dictate anywhere without relying on internet quality - Spend less time correcting names and niche vocabulary - Better inputs for AI tools since voice captures richer intent - Helpful for people with RSI, hand pain, or mobility limitations that make typing difficult Ready to get 1 hour back in your day?
