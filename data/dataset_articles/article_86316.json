  "text": "Google Trick: We all use Google countless times a day. Sometimes for homework, sometimes for office work, and sometimes just to pass the time. But did you know that Google Baba isn’t just a treasure trove of information, he also has many ways of having fun? These days, the number ’67’ is making waves on the internet. People are saying that searching for it on Google brings something you never imagined. Let’s find out the truth behind this viral trick!\nWhat’s the ’67’ thing?\nIf you type 67 or 6-7 into the Google search bar, your phone or computer screen suddenly starts shaking or vibrating. At first, anyone might be afraid the phone is damaged!\nDon’t panic! This isn’t a malfunction of your device. In fact, it’s a new Easter Egg (a kind of hidden feature) from Google. Google often incorporates viral trends around the world into its search engine. This ‘shake’ effect is inspired by the “brainrot” memes and transition videos that recently went viral on social media.\nHow does this amazing trick work?\nIf you want to try it, just follow these steps:\nOpen google.com\nSimply type 67 or 6-7 in the search box.\nNow press ‘Enter’ or tap the search button.\nWatch the magic! Your entire screen will shake like an earthquake for a few seconds.\nPro tip: This effect only lasts for a few moments, and then the screen automatically returns to normal. If the screen doesn’t stop shaking, refresh the page once, and everything will be fine.\nWhy does Google do this?\nGoogle periodically introduces features like this to make its boring search image a little more cool and fun. Previously, features like ‘Do a barrel roll’ (making the screen spin) and ‘Thanos Snap’ (making search results disappear) have been quite popular. This ’67’ trick is becoming especially popular among youngsters and meme lovers.\nA word of caution\nThis trick is completely safe and will not harm your data or device. This is a code created just for fun. So feel free to show it to your friends and surprise them!",
