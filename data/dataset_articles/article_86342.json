  "text": "Nvidia To Buy AI Chip Startup Groq In $20 Billion Blockbuster Deal\nImage Source: Pixabay\nNvidia (NVDA) dropped $20 billion to acquire Groq, an artificial intelligence startup that’s been eating into Nvidia’s dominance in a crucial part of the AI market, a CNBC report said on Wednesday.\nIt’s the chipmaker’s biggest deal ever, and it sends a clear message: Nvidia wants to control not just how AI models get trained, but how they actually get used by customers and companies.\nThe move is a bold consolidation play in an increasingly crowded AI chip market, which can reshape how enterprises buy and deploy artificial intelligence.\nWhat Groq does and why Nvidia needs it\nHere’s the simple version: Nvidia has owned the market for training AI models, that’s the expensive, compute-heavy part, where you teach an AI system to do something useful.\nGroq’s specialty is different. It focuses on inference, which is basically running that trained AI in real time.\nThink of it like this: Nvidia built the kitchen where AI gets cooked; Groq built the restaurant where it gets served to customers.\nGroq’s pitch is compelling. Its chips run AI workloads about four times faster than Nvidia GPUs while using far less power and costing way less to operate.\nThat matters enormously at scale. A company running millions of customer requests through ChatGPT-like systems every day would love a cheaper, faster way to do it.\nGroq’s already proven this works; it’s got over a million developers using its GroqCloud platform, and major customers, including Meta, are already running inference workloads on its hardware.\nThe startup raised $750 million just three months ago at a $6.9 billion valuation, so the $20 billion price tag shows how aggressively Nvidia wanted to lock this down.\nWhat this consolidation means\nNvidia just got bigger and more monopolistic. The company already controls about 90% of the market for AI training chips.\nNow it’s adding a credible inference alternative and folding Groq’s technology into its ecosystem.\nThat’s powerful because customers often prefer buying from one vendor instead of stitching together parts from multiple suppliers.\nIt’s simpler, it’s cheaper to support, and Nvidia has proven it knows how to play this game.\nBut consolidation has a downside. The Federal Trade Commission is already watching Nvidia closely.\nBuying Groq could trigger antitrust concerns at a time when Washington is scrutinising Big Tech harder than ever.\nRegulators will almost certainly take a close look at whether this deal reduces choice for customers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, which are desperate to reduce their Nvidia dependence anyway.\nFor other AI chip startups, this is a warning shot. Companies like Cerebras, SambaNova, and Graphcore were betting they could challenge Nvidia in specific niches.\nNow Nvidia’s message is clear: we will buy the best threats and eliminate the rest.\nMore By This Author:\nDisclaimer: Invezz is a place where people can find reliable, unbiased information about finance, trading, and investing – but we do not offer financial advice and users should always ...\nmore",
