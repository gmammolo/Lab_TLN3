  "text": "A lamp in the garage sparked a Wednesday afternoon fire that left more than $400,000 in damages to an Ashburn townhouse. Crews were called to the fire in the 43000 block of Baltusrol Terrace about 2:10 p.m., with units from Lansdowne, Ashburn, Moorefield, Kincora, and Leesburg, as well as numerous command staff responding, Loudoun County fire and rescue said in a news release. The first firefighters to arrive reported a two-story townhouse with smoke and fire showing. A \"Rapid Intervention Taskforce\" was subsequently requested to bring additional firefighters to the scene. Within 11 minutes of the initial dispatch, crews had multiple hand lines in place to control the fire and searched the entire inside of the structure to ensure no occupants were inside, the release said. No one was home, but a dog was rescued by firefighters. Crews determined there was no extension of the fire into the adjacent home. The Loudoun County Fire Marshal's Office determined the fire was accidental, caused by an unspecified electrical or mechanical event from a lamp on the workbench in the garage. Damages are estimated at $417,253. No resident or firefighter injuries were reported. The fire marshal's office reminds community members to always use caution when using extension cords. Always inspect cords for damage before use and replace if you observe any frayed or worn areas. Avoid overloading cords by plugging in only as many devices are recommended. Never run cords under carpets or rugs where damage can occur unnoticed. For additional electrical safety tips and information, visit the Electrical Safety Foundation’s website.",
