  "text": "Indian Railways achieved a milestone with the successful trial run on the newly constructed Chenab Rail Bridge, touted as the world's highest railway bridge. Spanning between Sangaldan in Ramban district and Reasi, the bridge is set to revolutionize rail connectivity in the region. ANI 2 / 5 USBRL Project Minister for Railways, Ashwini Vaishnaw, announced the successful trial run of a MEMU train along the Sangaldan-Reasi section of the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) project in Jammu & Kashmir. This crucial phase marks a significant step towards the operationalization of the entire line, enhancing connectivity from Baramulla to Sangaldan in the Kashmir Valley. ANI 3 / 5 Historical The USBRL project, including the 48.1 km Banihal-Sangaldan section, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 20, 2024. The project aims to link the Kashmir valley seamlessly with the Indian Railway network, facilitating smoother and faster transportation across the region. ANI 4 / 5 Engineering Marvel At an astonishing height of 359 meters (approximately 1,178 feet) above the Chenab River, the Chenab Rail Bridge stands taller than the Eiffel Tower. Spanning 1,315 meters in length, this architectural marvel exemplifies India's engineering prowess and commitment to enhancing infrastructure in challenging terrains. ANI 5 / 5 Future prospects Upon completion by year-end, the USBRL project will provide a crucial lifeline for the region, connecting major towns and cities in Jammu & Kashmir. With its completion, the project promises to not only boost economic opportunities but also foster cultural and social exchanges, reaffirming the Indian Railways' role in nation-building and regional integration.
