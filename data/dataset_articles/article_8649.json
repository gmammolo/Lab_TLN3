  "text": "HOLLIDAYSBURG — Blair County officials and first responders gathered alongside community members to honor local police officers who lost their lives in the line of duty during the 32nd annual ceremony outside of the county courthouse Thursday evening. The event, which was hosted by the Blair County Law Enforcement Officer’s Memorial Foundation, began with an introduction from Sheriff James Ott and prayer from AMED Chaplin Mike Blackie. “Almighty God, we come to you today to honor each individual name that’s on the memorial in front of us, that is engraved in the granite that’s here, but, more importantly, they’re engraved on the hearts of those who loved them and knew them best,” Blackie said. “We thank you for their sacrifice, their service.” District Attorney Pete Weeks talked about the importance of recognizing those who gave the “ultimate sacrifice.” “In 2023, 136 police officers lost their lives in the line of duty (nationwide),” Weeks said. Law enforcement officers have a challenging job, Weeks said, since they have to routinely risk their lives in service of the community. “They work long hours, usually overtime, and then court time which interrupts time with their family and their pre-paid vacations, and this is when it all goes right and they get to come home,” Weeks said. Retired Pittsburgh Chief of Police Scott Schubert delivered remarks as a guest speaker, noting that he was honored to be in the presence of so many people who respect and support their local police officers. “This is truly a beautiful part of Pennsylvania, and it warms my heart to see just how tight-knit the communities are here, and how much they love and support law enforcement. God knows they need it now more than ever,” Schubert said. Schubert recognized the friends and family of Blair Township Patrolman Ronald Turek, who helped found the foundation and to design the current pedestal and statue which reside on the courthouse grounds. “Thanks to you, the names of all these heroes will last forever in our hearts and on this beautiful memorial,” Schubert said. The families of the 12 local fallen officers were given an opportunity to lay a rose on the memorial, which was accompanied by a 21 Gun Salute, taps and a bagpipe rendition of “Amazing Grace” by Ron Vonada. According to Michele Pielmeier, who came to the ceremony in honor of her brother Turek, the service was “gratifying.” “It’s just a way to see that everybody remembers the sacrifice of all the officers on the memorial, not just my brother,” Pielmeier said. “You hear all the bad things (said about law enforcement) but you don’t see this too much, this is what it’s all about.” After the service, Weeks noted the strong support shown by community members. “I’ve always said, and I believe this sincerely, that Blair County is special in that we have a very close bond between the citizens of Blair County and the law enforcement that serve the citizens, it should be celebrated, and today is this for sure,” Weeks said.
