  "text": "Minnesota Aurora FC might be a community-owned club, but over the past two matches, the team has shared the wealth on the field, too. Four goal scorers found the back of the net in the Aurora's 5-0 victory over Bavarian United SC on Thursday night at TCO Stadium. And the team's last rout — Sunday's 6-0 home victory over Chicago Dutch Lions FC — featured six players netting a goal. Now, 14 players have scored for Minnesota (7-0-2) this season. \"This team is so deep,\" midfielder Katie Duong said. \"We've been working on being more clinical in the final third a lot in practice, and I think that's been translating the past couple of games.\" That's especially key for a club that's a pre-professional \"pit stop\" and \"pathway,\" said Aurora coach Colette Montgomery . With the timing of the playoffs in July, Aurora linchpins could miss playing time for trials with new pro teams. A diversified set of goal scorers provides a strategic, not just celebratory, advantage. \"If a player leaves this environment, we've helped them to get to where they go,\" Montgomery said. \"We know that we've got a large squad … and when the time is right, and they're needed, they're going to be able to step up.\" Coming off Sunday's three-assist, one-goal performance, Duong continued her sharp form with two goals and two assists against Bavarian United (4-4-1). After three consecutive games scoring long-range strikes, Duong netted a close-range, 16th-minute shot after a run up the right side of the field by forward Saige Wimes. But the 5,225 fans in attendance wouldn't go home without a Duong long-distance shot; she curled one into the far post in the 77th minute to put Minnesota up 5-0. \"I'm just starting to find my rhythm and my rhythm with the team as well,\" Duong said. Montgomery pointed out the team has been together for only 44 days total. Defender Julia Sattler opened the scoring in the 12th minute with a header off a lofted free kick into the six-yard box by Duong. Sattler's goal was her first in Minnesota after playing in Germany, Austria and Albania following college. Sattler and the back line recorded the Aurora's third shutout in a row. The two other Minnesota players on the scoresheet were Wimes, scoring off a cross from Jelena Zbiljic in the 26th minute, and Addy Weichers, heading home a corner kick from Duong. The Aurora remain first in the USL W League's Heartland Division, one point ahead of River Light FC and Chicago City SC. Minnesota looks to remain undefeated in its remaining three matches — including its next match at home Saturday against Chicago City SC — on the way to the league playoffs in July.",
