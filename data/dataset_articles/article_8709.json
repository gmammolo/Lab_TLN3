  "text": "Tokyo, February 2, 2022 - The Rakuten Group would like to extend its deepest sympathies to everyone who has been affected by the volcanic eruption in Tonga. We sincerely hope for the swift recovery of all the affected regions. Rakuten has begun accepting contributions for the Tonga Volcanic Eruption of January 2022 fund through its online donation system, the Rakuten Clutch Special Charity Fund. The Rakuten Clutch Special Charity Fund is an initiative launched in 2011 following the Great East Japan Earthquake. As more and more aid continued to flow in from both domestic and international sources, many requests were received to be allowed to make donations online. Over the years many have donated through the fund, and this support has been directed primarily towards raising funds to provide natural disaster relief both in Japan and internationally. To date, the fund has reached a cumulative total of over 1.2 billion yen. Those wishing to make donations can choose from a variety of payment methods including Rakuten Points, Rakuten Card, VISA and Mastercard credit cards, and cash transfers to a designated Rakuten Bank account, as indicated below. Donations through Rakuten Clutch will be presented to the Japanese Red Cross Society with the purpose of assisting those affected by the eruption. Rakuten will accept donations until February 28, 2022*1. The Rakuten Group is committed to maximizing the potential of the internet to empower the provision of aid to those in need, including charitable activities. *1 The donation period may be extended depending on future developments.
