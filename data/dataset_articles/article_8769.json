  "text": "23/06/2024 This news has been read 388 times!\nKUWAIT CITY, June 23: Once again, the leadership, government, and people of Kuwait have demonstrated why they were named “Leaders in Humanitarian Work” by the United Nations. This recognition stems from their continuous efforts and significant initiatives to assist those in need worldwide.\nThe most recent example of this humanitarian spirit was evident in the response to the Mangaf fire and its victims. Survivors of the fire, which claimed 49 lives and injured dozens, have expressed their deep gratitude for the swift and compassionate Kuwaiti response. The injured were promptly transferred to hospitals for treatment.\nKuwait’s announcement of financial compensation for the families of the fire victims was a significant relief for many. Survivors also appreciated the repeated visits from government officials to the accident site and hospitals since the morning of the incident. The efforts of the fire force and medical emergency teams in rescuing the building’s residents were also widely praised.\nSeveral injured workers who had been discharged from hospitals about ten days after the disaster, now residing in temporary housing. In one apartment, three injured individuals, (Supervisor Praveen Raju, driver Nalina Kishan, and worker Dorji Lama)were still recovering with plaster casts on their feet from fractures sustained while jumping from the second floor to escape the thick smoke, reports Al Rai. Raju recounted his escape, noting that he jumped onto a water tanker below but still suffered injuries due to inhaling smoke.\nThese survivors expressed their heartfelt thanks for the ongoing assistance, highlighting the humanitarian care they received from Kuwaiti officials at all levels. They also acknowledged the support from their home country, particularly the Indian ambassador in Kuwait and embassy staff, who were among the first to arrive at the accident site and maintained constant contact to check on their well-being.\nIn another apartment, four recently discharged individuals (Sharat, Santosh Pal, driver Anil Om, and storekeeper Faisal Muhammad) were also recovering, with some still in plaster casts. Pal described waking up at five in the morning to screams and attempting to escape through the smoke-filled stairs before returning to his apartment, where those who continued down succumbed to suffocation. Another survivor recounted attempting to descend from the balcony using a television cable, only to fall and break his legs when it snapped. These individuals echoed their colleagues’ gratitude for the humanitarian aid and efforts extended by Kuwait and their embassy.\nInjured worker’s families arrive in Kuwait Meanwhile, Five relatives of the workers injured in the Mangaf fire arrived in Kuwait. Four more individuals are expected to arrive this Wednesday. Upon their arrival, the relatives went directly to their accommodations to check the health status of the injured workers.\nThis news has been read 388 times!\n23/06/2024 Share Facebook X WhatsApp Share via Email Print Related Articles NBTC expresses condolences to Mangaf fire victims’ families 20/06/2024 A Kuwaiti, 3 Indians & 4 Egyptians Detention Over Mangaf Fire Extended 19/06/2024 Mangaf Fire Sparks Surge in Kuwait’s Warehouse and Housing Costs 18/06/2024 $15,000 compensation for each family affected by the Mangaf fire 18/06/2024 Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.\nCheck Also Close Kuwait Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh and Farwaniya Electricity Restored After Maintenance Work 23/06/2024 visit – WWW.ALJARALLAH.COM E Paper 24th Jun 23/06/2024 24th Jun Most Popular List of Kuwait Areas Set for 2-Hour Blackouts\n(48,559 views) Illegal Indian Restaurant in Salmiya Apartment Raided by Authorities\n(22,231 views) 55 Stores and Facilities Closed by KFSD\n(8,001 views) Escalating outages in Kuwait prompt solar energy proposal\n(5,951 views) Expat Deported After Caught in Smartphone Smuggling at Kuwait Airport\n(3,857 views) Stuck in an Elevator During a Power Outage?
