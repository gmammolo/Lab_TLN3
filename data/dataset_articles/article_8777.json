  "text": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (KELO) — The city of Sioux Falls says that it is making ‘significant progress’ in tackling the flooding threat. According to a press release, the city cites summer-like weather without additional rainfall on Sunday is allowing crews to make great progress in multiple areas of the flash flooding event. The Big Sioux River and Skunk Creek have crested in the Sioux Falls area, allowing water levels to come down. Crews have been able to reopen arterial streets throughout the city, including 12th Street at La Mesa Avenue, 41st Street at Louise Avenue and 49th Street between Louise Avenue and Kiwanis Avenue. Crews will continue to open roads as it becomes safe to do so. The community of Sioux Falls is encouraged to check siouxfalls.gov/flood for up-to-date information on road closures as progress is made. The amount of rain Sioux Falls received in such a short amount of time continues to stress the City’s storm drainage and wastewater collection and treatment systems, but they are beginning to slowly catch up. Pumps are still operating in areas needed to clear out the local storm drainage systems. “We appreciate the community’s willingness to do their part and conserve their wastewater usage the last 36 hours. The One Sioux Falls response has been amazing to experience and has made a difference,” said Mark Cotter, Director of Public Works said in the press release. “Our wastewater collection and treatment systems remain strained, but they are back to a point where we believe it is manageable.” Community members who are cleaning up water damage from this flash flooding event are asked to bring carpeting, furniture, or other items that need to be disposed of to the Sioux Falls Regional Sanitary Landfill. The landfill is closed on Sundays but open Monday through Saturday from 7:30 am to 5 pm. Residents receive one free annual pass to the landfill to dispose of items for free. City officials also send some reminders to citizens regarding flooded areas, including: - Call 911 in the event of a life-threatening emergency. - Call 211 for non-emergencies. - Turn around if you experience water on the road. - Respect road barricades. Do not drive around them, as they mark road and park closures. - Keep a safe distance away from rushing water and follow posted safety signage.",
