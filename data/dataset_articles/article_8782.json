  "text": "In a recent development, Governor Ahmed Aliyu of Sokoto State has initiated the distribution of N100 million funds provided by the state government to individuals affected by the recent fire outbreak at the Sokoto central market.\nThe announcement was made in a statement released to the media on Saturday in Sokoto, as disclosed by the Governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Malam Abubakar Bawa.\nSenator Sahabi Gada, serving as the Committee’s Chairman, represented Aliyu during the disbursement of financial aid, emphasizing that the recipients were categorized based on the extent of their losses.\nThe distribution involved giving N19 million to the most heavily impacted traders, with those facing lesser losses receiving N300,000 each.\nBawa further stated that the committee took meticulous steps to ensure that only genuine victims of the disaster benefitted from the support.\nQuoting Gada, Bawa mentioned, “Our detailed assessment of the impacted areas is aimed at directing the assistance to the right individuals.”\nGada clarified, “The aid provided by the Governor is not about compensating but offering relief to those affected, aiding them in restarting their businesses.”\nGada urged the beneficiaries to utilize the financial assistance prudently to achieve the intended purpose.\nHe further highlighted the appreciation expressed by Alhaji Garba Gwazi, the Chairman of the Motorcycles Sellers Association in the state, towards Governor Aliyu for his compassionate gesture, underscoring his care and concern for the state’s residents.",
