In recent years, flash floods triggered by glacial lake outbursts have resulted in fatalities, displaced hundreds, and disrupted communication lines and road networks in Sikkim and Uttarakhand.\nShah suggested creating at least 50 large ponds in the northeast to divert and store water from the Brahmaputra.
