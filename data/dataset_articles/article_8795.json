  "text": "By KATIE GARCIA ,\n2 hours ago\nJANESVILLE – Volunteers came out to the former Rock County Job Center, 1900 Center Ave., on Janesville’s southside on Sunday, to help clean up damage from a reported tornado that hit the city’s southside Saturday night.\nThe center was serving as a hub until 4 p.m. Sunday, providing support and food for volunteers and storm victims, as part of the City of Janesville’s Emergency Operations Center.\nVolunteers were distributing sack lunches, water and being sent out on assignments to impacted homes. As of 12:15 p.m., nearly 140 people had signed up to volunteer, not including the volunteers coordinating the hub.\nJanesville resident Velma Leak wore one of her husband’s high-visibility vests as she helped to coordinate volunteers.\n“Anyone in the area who wants to volunteer is more than welcome to come out and help. Anyone who requires help is welcome to come out and give their addresses and inform us of what they need. Whether it be food, a chainsaw, or just people to move brush,” Leak said.\nNiqi Linneman and her daughter stood behind a table provided by the Janesville Community Center, handing out food donated by Hacienda Real and Panera Bread.\nThe owners of JD’s Lunchbox, a local popup hotdog stand, were meanwhile handing out free hotdogs to volunteers.\nJD’s Lunchbox owners John Toles and Dana Toles said they were impacted by the reported tornado and wanted to support their community by handing out free food while supplies lasted.\n“There’s a lot of elderly and disabled people on the southside of Janesville. We felt like we needed to do our part to help,” John Toles said.\nCity of Janesville employees and EOC community support members Becky Lee and Linda Kleven, and Diversity Action Team of Rock County member Teresa Nguyen were gathering volunteer information to ensure safety before volunteers moved over to the next table for assignments. Volunteers were asked to return to check out so the city can keep track of the hours they put in.\nLeak said she had been out since early Sunday morning helping her aunt clear debris before coming to help at the former job center.\n“I wasn't directly impacted by the storm but when I was younger, my family was impacted by some really bad storms in our hometown,” Leak said. “I saw the community come together and I thought to myself if that ever happens, I want to help. I'm very proud of how well the community has come together, showing all the support to everyone.”\nCathy Myers, a candidate for the 44th Wisconsin Assembly District and her campaign manager, Shane Seeman, and Janesville police officer Bradley Rau were assigning volunteers to areas that had requested assistance.\n“Rau has been making sure we’re doing this in a very orderly fashion and to comply with city requirements to get volunteer information and keep everyone safe,” Nguyen said. Rau and other volunteers who were not on scene were organizing which homes need help.\n“Some bigger requests we are not able to accommodate, but people with chainsaws and hand tools are willing to come out and make those bigger branches more manageable to pile up or dispose of,” Rau said.\nThe Salvation Army Rock County was also on scene distributing cases of water, Gatorade and 200 sack lunches that they’d prepared, sheltered by two instant canopy tents.\n“Volunteers brought enough donations for us to put together another 200,” Lt. Jen Rysdyk with the Salvation Army said. “Those are being made at our building right now. I don't know how many days they have planned for us to be out here.”\nRysdyk said the Salvation Army’s building at 514 Sutherland Ave. is now open as an emergency shelter.\nThose wanting to stay at the Salvation Army, 514 Sutherland Ave., must be checked in before midnight Sunday.\n“We are taking physical donations, such as food and water, and ECHO is taking the monetary donations,” Rysdyk also noted.\nLocal businesses that had donated food and supplies on Sunday included Home Depot, Woodman’s Markets and Festival Foods.\nFor questions about the Emergency Operations Center call (608) 373-6025. To request help call (608)607-1314.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
