  "text": "( NewsNation ) — Nine days after a hike gone wrong, 34-year-old Lukas McClish was found safe in California’s Big Basin State Park and reunited with his family. One photographer captured it all.\nEmergency rescue photographer Steve Kuehl was on the scene when responding agencies located McClish after more than a week of searching.\n“It was obviously a very emotional and raw moment for everybody. Because at that moment, all the responders that were there got to see a mother seeing her son alive for the first time in almost weeks, not knowing what happened to them,” Kuehl said. “So it was a powerful moment.”\nMissing hiker rescued after nine days in California forest Kuehl has known McClish’s family for years and witnessed how his disappearance impacted his loved ones.\n“His father’s a retired fire chief from the local districts, and he pretty much never stopped hiking from what I heard,” he said. “He had been up for days, hiking for days, looking in all parts of that area and around our district.”\nClose Thank you for signing up!\nSubscribe to more newsletters here .\nSubscribe Now\nYour Morning Newsletter Submit While fire damage changed the landscape of the park and wiped away markers McClish had grown familiar with, leading to his disappearance, fires are also what helped save him.\nThe man who called and reported McClish’s yelling — the “unsung hero” of the incident, according to Kuehl — was a retired firefighter with a good ear.\nSearch for Wisconsin 3-year-old Elijah Vue nears four months “[His] house burned down and CZU fire that came through here about four years ago,” Kuehl said. “And with all the foliage removed in the canyon below his house, he was able to hear Lucas calling for help.”\nRescuing agencies said McClish had no major injuries when he was found.",
