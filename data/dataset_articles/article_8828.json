  "text": "Gorakhpur: A man who thought he had cremated his wife last week, was reunited with her after she was found alive about 600 kilometres away in Jhansi. Ram Sumer, a 60-year-old resident of Bansgaon in Gorakhpur, reported his wife Phoolmati missing on June 15. Four days later, on June 19, a woman’s body was discovered in the Uruva Bazaar area. Sumer identified the body as his wife and carried out the last rites.However, the case took a surprising turn when the post-mortem revealed that the woman had been strangled to death. This revelation led the police to probe further into the matter. The police then traced Phoolmati’s mobile phone, which showed activity in Jhansi, around 600 kilometres from Gorakhpur. Call records indicated frequent contact between Phoolmati and a man named Shubham from Sultanpur.Upon questioning, Shubham revealed that Phoolmati was alive and he had taken her to Jhansi. The police then located Phoolmati at the address provided by Shubham.Sumer told the police that Phoolmati had left her parental home on June 15 to return to his house but never arrived. After searching extensively, he reported her missing.Superintendent of Police (South) Jitendra Kumar Tomar said that Phoolmati was sent back to her husband on Saturday after recording her statement. The investigation is ongoing to determine the relationships between Sumer, Phoolmati, Shubham, and the unidentified woman who was cremated. The police have also obtained CCTV footage showing a suspicious individual and are re-investigating the case.(With inputs from PTI)",
