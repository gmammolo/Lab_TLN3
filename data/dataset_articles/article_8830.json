  "text": "Surviving a dire situation seven years ago, the Deputy Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Senator Akon Eyakenyi, shared her harrowing experience of narrowly escaping death during the collapse of the Reigners Bible Internal Bible Church in Uyo.\nTragedy struck on December 10, 2016, as the church crumbled during the ordination ceremony of the senior pastor, Akan Weeks, resulting in numerous casualties and injuries.\nEven the then Governor Udom Emmanuel narrowly evaded death during the catastrophic event.\nRecounting the incident at her daughter’s wedding in Uyo, Eyakenyi revealed that her timely exit from the building moments before the collapse likely saved her life.\nShe disclosed that the area where she had been seated inside the church was severely affected by the collapse.\n“Blessing (my daughter) was nurtured by another set of parents during her upbringing – the former Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Mr. Udom Gabriel Emmanuel, and his wife, Martha Udom Emmanuel.\n“While Blessing pursued her Master’s degree in the US, the former governor and his wife assumed responsibility for her welfare, overseeing her education until her return to Nigeria. It was a significant sacrifice.”\n“I owe my survival to the former governor’s selfless act. On the fateful day of December 10, 2016, it was a portion of the tuition fees he bore that led me out of the collapsing church, mere moments before its collapse.\n“The section where I had been seated suffered grave injuries, but I was spared. I attribute my continued existence to his intervention. I am truly grateful,” expressed the deputy governor.\nShe extended her gratitude to Governor Umo Eno for his unwavering support towards her and her family, acknowledging his significant role in their lives.\n“The governor has been instrumental in showering blessings upon my family and the children present here today. Words fall short in expressing my appreciation for everything he has done,\n“I want to sincerely thank him. May he and his wife be blessed abundantly,” concluded Eyakenyi.",
