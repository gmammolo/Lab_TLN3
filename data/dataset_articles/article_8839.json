  "text": "Rescue efforts in Spencer bring community together in tough time SPENCER, IOWA (KTIV) - ”I woke my daughter up in her room and woke my son up in his room and I said you guys need to get your stuff and get the hell out of the house now,” said Brian Habben, a Spencer resident. Urgent action taken by many residents in Spencer as flooding ravages the community. In spite of the tragic event however, residents are finding ways to lend a helping hand to those in need. “It was really devastating to see our town like this, but I was really just in the zone of trying to help anybody that we could. I’ve always been the type of person to give the shirt off my back and i believe in good karma, so you give out good karma you get it back,” said Wyatt Gardner, a Spencer resident. Boats, kayaks and canoes all taken to the flood streets to rescue neighbors. Derek Halquist and Wyatt Gardner came up with a system to find those affected. “Our wives are on Facebook and they’re getting all their updates and we’re just kind of going where we’re needed so that’s where we’re at right now,” said Derek Halquist, a Spencer resident. The duo using their own kayaks and rescuing a few themselves. Just a few people lending a big helping hand. Copyright 2024 KTIV. All rights reserved.",
