  "text": "The new CAVITEX (R1) link to Sucat in Paranaque City is accessible toll-free for a limited time. Photo from CAVITEX FB. The CAVITEX C5 Link Sucat Interchange opened to the motoring public over the weekend, reducing travel time from Kawit, Cavite, to just five minutes. Previously, the journey took about an hour on existing public roads. The new road access opened toll-free for a limited time. The interchange which opened on Sunday, June 23, 2024, extends from the 14-kilometer CAVITEX expressway which connects Manila to Cavite via Roxas Boulevard. An estimated 23,000 vehicles are expected to use the new route daily. The Philippine Reclamation Authority (PRA) had earlier proposed a 30-day suspension of toll fees for all vehicles using the Manila-Cavite Toll Expressway in Taguig, Parañaque, Las Piñas, Bacoor, and Kawit. This initiative aims to familiarize motorists with the new roads. A new two-kilometer segment of the CAVITEX C5 Link Expressway (Segment 3B) is under construction. Once completed, it will cut travel time from the CAVITEX R1 Expressway Section to SLEX/C5 Road to just 10 minutes, down from the usual 40 minutes. The Cavitex C5 Link provides access points at C5 Road in Taguig and Dr. A. Santos Avenue in Parañaque. Access maps released by the Cavitex Infrastructure Corporation can be found in this FB post: Transportation to and from Cavite has also been improved by the Cavite-Laguna Interchange (CALAX) and the soon-to-be-opened LRT-1 Cavite Extension.
