I would like to warmly thank the generous donors who contributed their Adahi through QRCS.”\nInternationally, Adahi Project was implemented in 15 countries across Asia and Africa, in coordination with the host national societies.\nIn cooperation with Pakistan Red Crescent Society (PRCS), sacrificial goats were distributed to 80 families, or 560 beneficiaries, in eight flood-affected provinces, including Sindh, Punjab, and Balochistan.

Totaling 100 tons, with a shelf life of one year, the canned meat will be distributed to over 26,400 beneficiaries. QRCS's office in Sudan distributed the meat of 134 cows, or 938 sacrificial meat parcels, to 2,700 displaced families at shelter centers in Red Sea and Kassala States.
