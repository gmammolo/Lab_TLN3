'We are proud to support the Red Cross in delivering critical supplies to affected communities in New Mexico so they can recover and thrive.' The Foundation is pledging up to $50,000 , which would help support the distribution of much-needed resources to those impacted by the fast-moving fires. Part of the Sempra Foundation's legacy includes responding to disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes and earthquakes.\n'With its diverse culture, deep heritage and stunning landscapes, New Mexico is truly the land of enchantment,' continued Alexander.
