  "text": "Cabonne Council has proudly taken home top honours at the 2025 Statewide Mutual Conference, held on 28–29 August, with multiple awards recognising its commitment to innovation and excellence in risk management.\nThe Council was awarded the Risk Management Excellence Award in the Operational Risk Initiative category for Regional, Rural and County Councils, thanks to its proactive Unsupervised Pools Program. This initiative stood out for its practical approach to community safety and operational risk, earning Cabonne not only the category win but also the title of Overall Winner for its group.\nAdding to the celebrations, Cabonne also received the prestigious FM Scholarship for Building Asset Protection. The scholarship was awarded to Matt Christensen, who will travel to Singapore next year to attend the FM Training Centre, further strengthening the Council's expertise in asset management and protection.\nThese achievements highlight Cabonne's leadership in risk management and its ongoing dedication to building safer, more resilient communities.\nhere.",
