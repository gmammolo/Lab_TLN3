  "text": "XRP News Today: XRP Holders Outmaneuver SEC, Reshape Crypto Regulation\n- XRP Army, a community of XRP holders, played a pivotal role in Ripple's 2024 SEC lawsuit victory by providing critical research and evidence.\n- Judge Torres ruled XRP is not a security in July 2023, reshaping crypto regulation and removing major legal uncertainty for digital assets.\n- The decision triggered a 72% XRP price surge and created regulatory clarity, though long-term risks remain due to XRP's centralized nature.\n- Grassroots advocacy demonstrated through amicus briefs and affidavits highlighted crypto communities' growing influence in legal and regulatory outcomes.\nThe XRP Army, a dedicated community of XRP tokenholders, played a pivotal role in Ripple’s legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to John Deaton, a legal advocate for crypto investors. Deaton emphasized that the community’s contributions were instrumental in shaping the outcome of the case, which culminated in August 2024 when both sides agreed to drop appeals. The lawsuit, initially filed in December 2020, alleged that Ripple’s sales of XRP were unregistered securities. After a protracted legal battle, Judge Analisa Torres ruled in July 2023 that XRP itself is not a security, a decision that effectively reshaped the regulatory landscape for digital assets.\nRipple’s deputy general counsel, Deborah McCrimmon, acknowledged the XRP Army’s indispensable role in the litigation process. She noted that the community, inspired by Deaton’s advocacy, conducted extensive research and uncovered critical evidence supporting Ripple’s “fair notice” defense. This included identifying past SEC speeches and regulatory communications that Ripple argued were inconsistent with how the agency applied the law. McCrimmon stated that the effort was invaluable, as it provided Ripple with the legal foundation to challenge the SEC’s enforcement actions. “We didn't ask them to do this, but once they saw the defense, they got to work,” she said in an interview with The Penta Podcast. The XRP Army’s efforts, she added, helped the court understand that the case impacted a wide range of stakeholders, not just Ripple.\nDeaton further highlighted the legal significance of the XRP Army’s involvement. In her final ruling, Judge Torres cited both Deaton’s amicus brief and affidavits from XRP holders. These materials were critical in reinforcing the argument that XRP is not a security, a distinction that could have far-reaching implications for the crypto industry. “The proof is in the decision itself,” Deaton wrote on X. “Had she not cited those things, people could legitimately debate whether our efforts made a real difference.” The inclusion of these materials in the ruling underscored the impact of grassroots advocacy in complex legal proceedings.\nThe legal victory also had immediate market effects. Following Judge Torres’ July 2023 decision, XRP’s price surged 72%, rising from $0.47 to $0.81. The price continued to climb, reaching an all-time high of $3.65 in July 2025, before retreating to $2.85 in recent days. Analysts have linked the price movements to broader regulatory clarity and the potential for spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The SEC’s decision to withdraw its appeal, under the leadership of pro-crypto appointee Paul Atkins, removed a major overhang for the token and signaled a more accommodating regulatory environment.\nDespite the positive developments, some experts caution that XRP’s long-term prospects remain uncertain. While the token has a clear use case in cross-border payments via Ripple’s network, financial institutions are not obligated to use XRP, which limits its direct upside. Additionally, unlike Bitcoin, XRP is centralized and controlled by Ripple, making it more susceptible to regulatory and corporate risks. Nevertheless, the XRP Army’s role in the lawsuit demonstrates the growing influence of crypto communities in shaping legal and regulatory outcomes. As Deaton noted, “One person can inspire many people, and together, they can make a difference.”\nSource: [1] XRP (Ripple) Plunged Below $3.
