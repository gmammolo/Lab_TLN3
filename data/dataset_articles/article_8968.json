  "text": "ROCKFORD, Ill. (WREX) — Good news came this week for people who live at the Luther Center in Rockford as residents were able to begin moving back in. The move came less than two weeks after an electrical fire broke out that forced more than 200 people from their home. Many of these people stayed in a hotel for the past week and half but were able to move home starting Tuesday. This date was earlier than scheduled as they were originally told they would be out for at least two weeks. The Salvation Army stepped in to provide transportation for those residents back to their apartment. \"For me I was impressed. When you do hear about fire and you think about an electrical system, what did it hurt in the electrical system, when there's a fire how much smoke, where did it go? That can cause a lot of damage too, but it sounds like to me from everything I'm hearing it was a centralized location,\" Monty Wandling, the Coordinator for the Salvation Army of Winnebago County said. Wandling also added that residents were pleased to get back to a sense of normalcy. \"It's just nice to see. I know they were very relieved and good to get out of the hotel. They were well cared for and were excited about that and our part on this one was literally saying, \"Hey, we've got some vehicles, and we can take some time and help get people home,\" Wandling said. At the time of the fire, it was estimated the Luther Center had over $500,000 worth of damage.",
