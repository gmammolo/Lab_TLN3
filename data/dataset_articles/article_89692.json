  "text": "GRAND BLANC — The community is invited to witness the opening of a time capsule that was buried at Indian Hill Elementary school more than 60 years ago.\nIn 1963, a time capsule was placed behind the cornerstone at the front of the school.\nAt 6 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 18, school officials will have a ceremony in the school cafeteria to open the capsule and reveal its contents.\nAll Indian Hill students, past and present, are urged to attend the ceremony, which takes place during Homecoming Week.\n“This ceremony will be a wonderful opportunity to reconnect with old classmates, share memories, and celebrate the legacy of Indian Hill,” Principal Timothy S. Stein said in a letter to the community.\n“Together, we will take a step back in time to reflect on what school life was like in 1963 and see the treasures that your generation left for us.”\nIn 1963, Indian Hill was one of the cornerstone elementary schools in a rapidly growing Grand Blanc community. That year marked a time of expansion in the district, as families moved to the area and schools worked to keep pace with enrollment growth.\n“The placement of the time capsule was a symbol of optimism for the future, a future we now share with you,” Stein wrote.\n“We sincerely hope you’ll be able to join us for this once-in-a-lifetime event. Your stories, memories, and presence will help make the occasion even more meaningful.” — L.R.",
