  "text": "By Jasmine Huda ,\n2 hours ago\nST. LOUIS COUNTY, Mo. – Police have broken up an organized retail theft ring that hit the Galleria, Plaza Frontenac, West County Center, Chesterfield, and beyond.\nAt the center of the alleged operation are Ashley Ford and Shannon Fisher, both 39 and from St. Louis. Police say surveillance footage shows the pair removing clothing from hangers and placing items into shopping bags.\nSgt. Brandon Elzinga, with the Des Peres Department of Public Safety’s Retail Theft Unit, said police from various jurisdictions are familiar with the two women, who he said hit multiple malls in a single day.\n“They were advertising, taking orders, and ultimately putting those items back out to the market to get them sold,” he said. “They could be at the Galleria just before lunch, and that might end up pointing to mall at West County Center by dinner.”\nPolice recover $12,000 worth of apparel stolen from area shopping malls The women allegedly hit shopping centers over a several-week period between July and August. Authorities said they were quick, organized, and efficient.\nHowever, they were no match for another organized operation – one that involved collaborative police work among various jurisdictions. Detectives from Frontenac, Chesterfield, and Des Peres joined forces to bring the alleged suspects into custody.\n“Our agencies work so well together. And this is evidence of that,” Frontenac Police Chief Craig Picha said.\nChesterfield Police obtained a court order for a tracking device that recently led detectives to two homes in Hanley Hills. Inside the homes were bags upon bags of stolen clothing from Lululemon, American Eagle, Victoria’s Secret, Burlington and other stores. In all, more than $12,000 worth of merchandise was recovered.\n“It’s a lot of evidence. You’ll see that many of the pieces still have the sensors attached to them,” Chesterfield Police Det. Sgt. Robert Powell said.\nIn many cases, retailers choose not to actively pursue shoplifters for a variety of reasons – potential liability, safety, and insurance issues. But Powell, and the other departments, said through a coordinated effort, authorities managed to apprehend the pair wanted for this operation.\n“We know that theft organizations can go in a lot of different directions. And we are prepared for that,” Det. Sgt. Powell said.\nClose Thanks for signing up!\nWatch for us in your inbox.\nSubscribe Now\nDaily News The closing of this case brings relief to the police. However, they know there are so many cases beyond this one.\n“Unfortunately, this is becoming the fastest-growing crime pretty much nationwide. Everybody always talks about the cost of everyday living, and this directly impacts that. Insurance companies have to pay for the loss. That then drives the cost of everyday products up. And ultimately, the American people and our communities are paying that price,” Sgt. Elzinga said.\nA new Missouri law that went into effect last week could help crack down on organized retail theft, as it increases the penalty for repeat offenders. Sgt. Elzinga said the ORT, or Organized Retail Theft Law, gives law enforcement another tool in their arsenal to combat thefts.\nThe offense would be a class C felony if the stolen merchandise in 120 days falls between $1,500 and $10,000. It bumps up to a class B felony if the value is more than $10,000.\n“This would have been a perfect case for that – because it gives more teeth to the prosecutors as well as law enforcement,” he said.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
