  "text": "Plans for a new AI factory have been approved by the Launceston council, who say the proposed project is a big win for the region.\nTechnology company Firmus first flagged a plan to develop the $2.1 billion centre in early 2025.\nThe company was then endorsed by Premier Jeremy Rockliff, who promised in the 2025 state election to smooth the road for Firmus and ensure they had what they needed.\nAt a special council meeting held on September 1, 2025, the Launceston Council endorsed a recommendation to grant a planning permit for what Firmus calls an AI factory.\nThe centre will see Firmus redevelop their five-hectare St Leonards property, located in Launceston's east.\nThe development will include two large server halls, an office building, associated infrastructure, and landscaped surroundings and is designed to operate 24/7, according to a statement issued by the council.\nWhat is an AI factory?\nAn AI factory is like a data centre, which have been cropping up nationwide and is a growing and lucrative industry.\nSearch engines, online banking transactions, online videos, and digital calls are all fed back to data centres, which store and process the information.\nFirmus' AI factory operates in a slightly different way, instead focusing more on AI.\nIt produces what are called tokens, which AI software, like ChatGPT, use to train itself.\nAI factories and data centres require a lot of energy and produce an extreme amount of heat.\nThey require liquid cooling systems and are taxing on the environment.\nThis is again where Firmus' planned AI factory differs.\nTheir AI factory will use Tasmanian renewable energy and a cooler environment to produce a green AI token.\n'A big win for jobs, investment and the future of our region'\nCity of Launceston Mayor Matthew Garwood described the new facility as a big win for the region.\n\"This project really puts Launnie on the map as a hub for digital innovation,\" he said.\n\"It's about more than just data. It's about harnessing Tasmania's renewable energy advantage and making sure our city is at the forefront of Australia's AI and tech economy.\"\nDuring the 2025 state election campaign trail, Mr Rockliff said Firmus' AI factory would result in 100 direct jobs and support hundreds more through construction, energy and technology supply chains and more direct jobs in future stages of the project.\nBoth the council and the state government have positioned this project to be just the beginning.\nThis would follow a national trend of data centres becoming more commonplace.\nAccording to a 2024 Mandala report, new investments in Australian data centres are forecasted to reach $26 billion by 2030.\nThe report said this was due to the rising popularity of internet-connected devices, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\nIt also predicted the data centre workforce to reach 17,900 by 2030.\nTributes & Funerals Notices\nMore Tributes & Funerals Notices",
