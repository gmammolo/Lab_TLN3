  "text": "Containment has grown on a pair of New Mexico wildfires that caused that destroyed thousands of structures and forced the evacuation of more than 8,000 people.\nThe Salt and South Fork fires have burned more than 25,000 acres. The South Force fire, the biggest blaze, is 31% contained. The Salt fire is 7% contained.\n“The South Fork and Salt fires saw additional precipitation on Saturday, making it difficult for crews to access some areas due to unsafe conditions,” an update from the New Mexico Fire Information service states. “On Sunday, weather conditions will allow firefighters to continue securing the perimeter and responding to hot spots within the interior of the fire area.”\nThere are 1,114 personnel assigned to the fires, and 88 engines, 13 dozers and 18 water tenders.\nRecent rains and cooler weather have assisted firefighters working to contain the fires.\nToday has a potential for scattered storms, as warmer weather moves into the area. Temperatures are expected to warm to above normal with mostly light winds.\nFederal authorities are offering a reward for information about people responsible for igniting the wildfires, which have killed two people. The FBI on Saturday offered up to $10,000 for information in connection with the fires.\nRelated:\nGrowing Wildfires in New Mexico Destroyed 1,400 Structures New Mexico Wildfires Spread to 20,000 Acres, Forcing Thousands to Evacuate New Mexico Town Ordered to Evacuate Due to Large, Uncontained Wildfire\nTopics\n[Catastrophe](/catastrophe/)\n[Natural Disasters](/natural-disasters/)\n[Wildfire](/wildfire/)\n[Mexico](/location/mexico/)\n[New Mexico](/location/new-mexico/)\nWas this article valuable?\nHere are more articles you may enjoy.",
