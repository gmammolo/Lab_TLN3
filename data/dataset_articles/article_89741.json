  "text": "After ‘masterclass’ in witness stand, Cardi B is cleared of assaulting security guard in obstetrician’s office\nEccentric US rapper denied claims she left left security guard with facial scar from her fake nails\nAmerican rapper Cardi B has been cleared of assaulting a security guard with her three-inch rhinestone acrylic nails in the conclusion of an £18m (€20.7m) lawsuit.\nThe Grammy-winning singer was accused of scratching the face of Emani Ellis in the hallway of a Beverly Hills obstetrician’s office in 2018 and leaving a scar that required cosmetic surgery.\nCardi B, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almanzar, was four months pregnant with her first child at the time of the altercation and had been concealing her condition from the public through fear it would hamper her music career.\nThe 32-year-old told jurors in the civil trial that Ms Ellis had followed her up to the fifth floor of the office and began recording her on her phone.\nMs Ellis claimed that she had been assaulted, spat on, called racial slurs, and had lost her job after the incident, which had left her “deeply traumatised”.\nShe sought an estimated £18m in damages, including medical expenses, compensation for emotional and physical suffering and lost wages, along with punitive damages.\nHowever, on Tuesday, the panel of 12 jurors at Los Angeles Superior Court took less than an hour to clear Cardi B of the allegations of assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence and false imprisonment.\nI know I’ve got a little reputation but I swear, I am innocent\nOutside the Alhambra courthouse, Cardi B thanked her lawyers, media and fans and reiterated that she had never touched Ms Ellis.\n“Let’s just put this behind [us],” she said.\n“But I’m giving a warning. I am not that celeb you gonna sue and you think is going to settle.\n“Especially when I am super, completely innocent. I know I’ve got a little reputation but I swear to God, I am innocent,” she added, drawing laughter from the crowd of journalists gathered outside.\n“The next person that tries to do a frivolous lawsuit against me, I’m going to countersue and I’m going to make you pay,” the rapper added, before asking her fans not to send abusive messages to Ms Ellis or her family on social media.\nThe trial had attracted significant media attention over Cardi B’s eccentric behaviour in the witness stand.\nShe is, like, security-heavy. She looks like she could protect the building\nVideo excerpts of the rapper’s appearance from one day to the next in different wigs and hairstyles and her unvarnished responses to questions under cross-examination went viral online.\nIn one incident, recounting the physical differences between the two during the altercation, Cardi B, who is 5ft 2in tall and approximately 58kg, said of Ms Ellis, “She is like, security-heavy. She just looks a little, like, she could protect the building.”\nAsked by Ms Ellis’s attorney, Ron Rosen Janfaza, whether she was physically able to scratch someone at the time of the incident, she replied: “But I didn’t because I had a baby inside me.”\nPressed on whether she was disabled or not, she replied: “At that moment, when you’re pregnant, I’m very disabled. Do you want me to tell you things I can’t do?”.\nCardi B acknowledged cursing at Ms Ellis as the two women yelled at one another “chest-to-chest,” but she maintained that no physical contact was made, and she denied spitting or using racial epithets.\nSara Williams, a trial attorney and law professor from Alabama, described Cardi B’s performance in the witness stand as a “masterclass”.\n“She listened to the questions, she answered the questions with poise.”\nJoin the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel\nStay up to date with all the latest news",
