  "text": "Simplifying a two-tier tax system, the GST Council has approved a watershed step that lowers the four existing slabs (5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%) to just two: 5% and 18%. Beginning September 22, 2025, the restructuring aims to help the common man by moving daily requirements such as ghee, coffee, and toothbrush to the bottom 5% slab. Moreover, \"sin goods\" like high-end automobiles and tobacco will get a fresh 40% slab; 90% of the things from the 28% category will include small At the lowered rate of 18%, cars, air conditioners, and concrete are taxed. Along with stimulating economic activity, this reform promises greater affordability on household items, food products, and construction materials.\nSubstantial gains are predicted in sectors like FMCG, cars, and real estate. Major gains are predicted for FMCG behemoths including Britannia, ITC, and Nestlé India from lower pricing of biscuits, noodles, and shampoos. In the automotive industry, a dramatic increase in sales is expected to come from decreased GST on passenger cars, motorcycles, and components. The lower 18% GST on cement will energize the real estate industry, so favoring premium companies like UltraTech and Shree Cement. Likewise, tax breaks on artificial yarns, fertilizers, bio-pesticides, and solar gear would help the footwear, textile, agriculture, and renewable energy industries to expand.\nThough the changes are first forecast to cause a revenue loss of ₹477 billion, the government hopes to make up for this through greater consumer demand and economic expansion. Cheaper consumer products, better real estate affordability, and reduced expenses for vital industries like agriculture and renewable energy emphasize a change toward policies favoring the middle class and small companies. This significant GST change shows the government's emphasis on encouraging consumption-led development and improving access to basic commodities and services for millions of families.",
