  "text": "Amazon: Perth delivery centre opens up flexible job opportunities amid rising cost-of-living\nEver wanted to know what it’s like being the one dropping off parcels, instead of the one receiving them?\nAs the cost of living rises, Amazon’s Perth warehouse is searching for West Australians willing to pick up a side hustle.\nA new study by YouGov revealed 45 per cent of West Aussies were looking to sign on for additional work within the next six months as a result of rising cost-of-living rates.\nWith more than 950,000 Australians working more than one job, Amazon Australia spokesperson Ellie Thomas told PerthNow the e-commerce giant wanted to offer WA residents a chance to pick up a side hustle and earn some extra money in their spare time.\n“As residents look to supplement their earnings, our Perth delivery centre is offering new flexible opportunities,” Ms Thomas said.\n“Amazon Flex enables everyday Australians to earn extra money when it suits them, using their own vehicles to deliver Amazon packages.\n“We also schedule all delivery blocks a week in advance, meaning our Perth delivery partners know upfront the minimum they will earn and can schedule shifts to suit their work and personal lives.”\nSide hustles have grown in popularity over the past year, with 61 per cent of Aussies either taking up a side hustle or considering one within the past 12 months.\nFinancial planner Canna Campbell said side hustles such as Amazon Flex delivery can make a sizeable financial difference for a WA household, especially when the cost-of-living continues to rise.\n“Side hustles like this are a great way to supplement someone’s income, no matter their age or circumstances — especially given how many Aussies are feeling the pinch,” she said.\n“Taking on extra work may sound daunting but just a few extra hours a week can have a huge impact on a household budget and someone’s peace of mind — with Amazon, for example, a weekly four-hour delivery block can earn someone an additional $6,136 a year at a minimum.”\nThe study shows the average WA household is looking to boost its budget by an extra $578 per week.\nElizabeth Yonatan is one of many Aussie residents who has already taken the Amazon plunge.\nShe works a day job as an acupuncturist — but after the 9 to 5 ends, she heads to the warehouse and delivers packages across the city for Amazon Flex.\n“Delivering packages allows me to get outside and gives me some time to refresh, away from the clinic,” Ms Yonatan said about the gig.\n“For me, it works well as the flexibility allows me to schedule delivery blocks around my clients and personal plans, knowing in advance when I will be delivering.”\nMore information on Amazon’s current Perth opportunities can be found via their website.",
