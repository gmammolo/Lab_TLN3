  "text": "DH cracks down on unlicensed medicine shops illegally selling controlled medicines\nThe Department of Health (DH) yesterday (September 3) conducted a joint operation with the Police in Sham Shui Po District to crack down on unlicensed medicine shops illegally selling controlled medicines. During the operation, controlled drugs were seized and two people were arrested.\nThe DH received intelligence indicating that two unlicensed medicine shops located in Pak Tin were suspected of illegally selling or possessing controlled medicines. The DH, in collaboration with the Police, took enforcement action at the two premises concerned. During the operation, 125 types of controlled drugs were discovered on the premises. A 39-year-old woman and a 36-year-old man present at the scene were arrested on suspicion of illegally selling Part 2 poisons and illegally possessing Part 1 poisons and antibiotics respectively.\nA preliminary investigation indicated that the products seized during the operation included substances classified as Part 1 poisons or Part 2 poisons under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138) (PPO), and antibiotic substances under the Antibiotics Ordinance (Cap. 137) (AO). Some of the products also did not bear Hong Kong registration numbers for pharmaceutical products as required by law and were labelled only in foreign languages (including Japanese and English).\nThe DH will continue to follow up and investigate the incident.\nAccording to the PPO, all pharmaceutical products must be registered with the Pharmacy and Poisons Board of Hong Kong before they can be legally sold in the market. Additionally, only persons authorised by the Board as Authorized Sellers of Poisons (ASPs) are allowed to conduct the relevant retail business of selling poisons listed in Part 1 and Part 2 of the Poisons List at Schedule 10 of the Pharmacy and Poisons Regulations (Cap. 138A) at premises registered by the Board, whereas Listed Sellers of Poisons can only conduct the retail business of selling poisons listed in Part 2 of the Poisons List. Illegal sale or possession of unregistered pharmaceutical products or Part 1 poisons and illegal sale of Part 2 poisons are criminal offences. The maximum penalty for each offence is a fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment. Moreover, according to the AO, ASPs can only sell antibiotics with the authority of a doctor's prescription. The maximum penalty for illegal sale or possession of antibiotics is a fine of $50,000 and 12 months' imprisonment.\nThe DH strongly urges members of the public not to buy or use unregistered pharmaceutical products as their safety, efficacy and quality are not guaranteed. All registered pharmaceutical products should carry a Hong Kong registration number on the package in the format of \"HK-XXXXX\". Members of the public should not self-medicate without advice from healthcare professionals. They should stop using them and consult healthcare professionals if they are in doubt or feeling unwell after use. They may visit the website of the Drug Office of the DH for \"General Knowledge on the Use of Medicines\" for information.",
