  "text": "Will Colorado Ever See Male NFL Cheerleaders? Here’s What We Know\nIt was recently announced that the Minnesota Vikings would be introducing multiple male cheerleaders to their roster for the 2025-2026 NFL Season.\nThis announcement was met with a variety of reactions, from praise to disdain to indifference.\nWhile not overtly common, male cheerleaders are nothing new, as former United States President was a male cheerleader many years before being elected, and the late comedian and actor Robin Williams even made a hilarious one-time appearance as a male cheerleader for the Denver Broncos back in the 1970s.\nSo, the question must be asked: Will the Denver Broncos see the return of male cheerleaders in 2025, like the Minnesota Vikings?\nWill Colorado Have Male NFL Cheerleaders in 2025?\nAccording to the official website of the Denver Broncos, the team will include a total of 28 cheerleaders for the 2025-2026 season, all of whom are female.\nWhile Denver does not appear to be employing any male cheerleaders for the upcoming NFL season, the Minnesota Vikings are far from the only team that will be in 2025.\nWhat Teams Besides the Minnesota Vikings Have Male Cheerleaders?\nAccording to a new article from Newsweek, a total of 11 NFL teams have male cheerleader on their rosters for the upcoming 2025-2026 season.\nRead More: What’s Wrong With Empower Field At Mile High Stadium?\nThese teams include the aforementioned Minnesota Vikings, as well as the Baltimore Ravens, Los Angeles Rams, New England Patriots, New Orleans Saints, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Tennessee Titans, San Francisco 49ers, Philadelphia Eagles, Washington Commanders, and the Seattle Seahawks.\nDenver Broncos 2025 Schedule\nDenver Broncos2025 season could be one of their best in recent years, as Bo Nix moves into his second season and Head Coach\nSean Paytonmoves into his third.\nGallery Credit: Dave Jensen\nThe Good, The Great, The Ugly — The 19 Head Coaches of the Denver Broncos\nGallery Credit: Dave Jensen\nDenver Broncos All-Time Leading Rushers\nGallery Credit: Bert Remien",
