  "text": "By Jill Kuramoto ,\n2 hours ago\nHONOLULU (KHON2) — Honolulu officials are adding more eyes in two high-profile areas. It’s part of a push to improve public safety at some of the island’s most visited – and sometimes most vulnerable – spots.\nHonolulu park video surveillance could expand Halona Blowhole is one of Oahu’s iconic postcard views. But it’s also a hot spot for car break-ins and other crimes. Now, it’s one of two places that are getting video surveillance cameras installed, aimed at improving safety and deterring crime.\n“With the shortage of police officers, this is maybe just another way to stop the criminal activity in the area,” said Councilmember Augie Tulba, chair of the Public Safety and Economy Committee.\nIn total, 10 new cameras are going up – two at Halona Blowhole and eight more at Hawaii’s Plantation Village.\nThe cultural museum tells the story of immigrant plantation life in Hawaii, but in recent years, staff say they have struggled with repeated vandalism, theft and break-ins.\n“Whenever there’s a break in, we do have to shut that building down, so it is something that the visitors won’t be able to experience until it gets fixed for safety. There’s also the financial impact to us. Every time a window is broken, it costs us anywhere between $1,000 to $2,000 just to fix the window because it has to be done time period to fit the rest of the plantation experience,” said Derrick Iwata, Education and Program Manager at Hawaii’s Plantation Village.\nThe non-profit museum has a consignment agreement with the city and county to operate on the property. The cameras at the Plantation Village are being paid for by a grant.\nGet Hawaii’s latest morning news delivered to your inbox, sign up for News 2 You\n“We talk about the history of old Hawaii and how things were, you know, people used to trust each other. I mean, I remember hearing stories like people never locked their doors, right? And now, fast forward to now, where we have to put security cameras because we can’t trust our neighbors or to protect ourselves, right? So it’s kind of sad that way that we come to this point,” said Iwata.\nHonolulu has gradually expanded its use of cameras in public spaces – from Chinatown to city parks.\nThese 10 cameras now bring the total to 176 cameras in 19 city parks island-wide. The city is paying $65,000 for the cameras at the Blowhole, Makapuu and Lanai lookouts on East Oahu.\nHowever, not everyone is on board with more cameras in public spaces. Privacy advocates argue the city needs clear policies on how footage is stored and who has access.\nBut city officials maintain the cameras will only be used for safety and enforcement purposes, not constant monitoring.\n“It’s just another way of securing the place. So, I don’t think privacy will be an issue because. again, it’s an open public place to people to come and enjoy the area,” said Tulba.\nDownload the free KHON2 app for iOS or Android to stay informed on the latest news\nThe cameras are expected to be installed and operating in the next few weeks.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
