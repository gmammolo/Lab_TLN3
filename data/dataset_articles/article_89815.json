  "text": "A memorial event was held on Wednesday in Nanjing City, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, to mark the 80th anniversary of victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War.\nThemed \"Remember History, Cherish Peace,\" the event took place at the Memorial Hall of the Victims of the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders, and was attended by more than 200 people, including youth delegates, representatives of volunteers who served as guide in the exhibitions and staff of the memorial hall.\nThe commemoration opened with four young buglers sounding a fanfare. As the final notes faded, the crowd stood in silence before joining together in singing China's national anthem.\nA flower-laying ceremony followed. Wreaths were placed in memory of the victims of the Nanjing Massacre, civilians killed by Japanese invaders, revolutionary martyrs and national heroes who sacrificed their lives for victory, and foreign soldiers and friends who fought alongside the Chinese people during the war. The fragrance of lilies and chrysanthemums carried a tribute of remembrance and a wish for lasting peace.\nStudents then recited and sang war of resistance-themed poems and songs. The ceremony ended with participants singing the patriotic song \"Ode to the Motherland\" while waving national flags.\n\"This event taught me that remembering history is not about reliving pain, but about spreading the power of peace with our voices,\" said Chen Sisi, a student.",
