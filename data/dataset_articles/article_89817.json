This Korean debut doesn’t mean &TEAM is abandoning their Japanese market roots. The group is likely to maintain a dual-market strategy, similar to other successful international acts. Their label YX LABELS (formerly HYBE LABELS JAPAN) has the infrastructure to support releases in both markets, allowing &TEAM to grow their fanbase in Korea while maintaining their strong Japanese following.\nQ: What makes &TEAM’s Korean debut different from other Japanese groups entering K-pop?\nA: &TEAM’s approach is unique because they’re backed by YX LABELS with existing HYBE ecosystem connections, giving them access to proven Korean market strategies. Unlike groups that completely transition markets, &TEAM appears to be expanding rather than relocating their focus. Their multicultural background and previous international exposure also position them better for cross-cultural appeal than groups making more traditional market transitions.",
