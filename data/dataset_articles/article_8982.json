  "text": "(Photo : Fresno County Sheriff's office) Christian Ramirez was missing for 22 hours A 4-year-old boy is safe and reunited with his family after spending nearly 24 hours [ missing in the California wilderness](https://www.hngn.com/articles/261638/20240623/california-hiker-survived-lost-mountains-wilderness-berries-week.htm). Christian Ramirez's family reported the young boy [missing](https://www.hngn.com/articles/261205/20240604/girl-missing-bus-stop-pennsylvania-vanished-1985-cherrie-mahan.htm) on Thursday after searching for him at the Rancheria Campground, on the northeastern side of Huntington Lake. The [Fresno County Sheriff's Office says](https://www.facebook.com/FresnoSheriff/videos/487440496963331) more than 50 people took part in the \"non-stop\" hunt for little Christian. At around 8 a.m. Friday, members of the Tulare County Search and Rescue Team found Ramirez about a quarter-mile away from where he was last seen. He was found \"nestled under a tree\" near the lake. \"He was hungry and exhausted, but otherwise in good health. We got him a sandwich and then carried him out to be reunited with Mom and Dad,\" the Fresno County Sheriff's Office said. A video showed the boy eating and talking to a rescuer who carried him down the mountain. The searchers posed for a photo with the happy parents after a reunion with their son. \"This was an amazing show of teamwork and dedication,\" the sheriff's office said. With TMX",
