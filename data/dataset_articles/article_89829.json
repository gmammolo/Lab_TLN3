  "text": "KUALA TERENGGANU (Sept 4): The Congress of Unions of Employees in the Public Service (Cuepacs) has urged the government to give greater attention to upgrading dilapidated health facilities in the upcoming Budget 2026.\nIts president, Datuk Dr Adnan Mat, said the union had found that there were still health clinics in rural and interior areas in a rundown state, affecting the quality of medical services provided to the people.\n“We (Cuepacs) have conducted field visits, especially to rural and interior clinics. We found that there are still clinics with earthen floors and wooden walls in a dilapidated condition,” he said at the 10th Cuepacs Terengganu Madani 2025 Appreciation Dinner here last night.\nHe hoped that in the coming budget, the government would continue upgrading health facilities so that healthcare workers can deliver the best services to the people.\nIn addition, Adnan said Cuepacs also appealed to the government to expedite the confirmation of about 2,000 community nurses who had passed the Promotion Through Appointment (PSL) exercise to meet the pressing needs of the country’s healthcare sector.\nHe said medical sector workers, including nurses, were currently under pressure due to heavy workloads at all facilities caused by staff shortages.\n“We found that nearly 2,000 community nurses have passed the PSL, but they have not been appointed as trained nurses or promoted from grade U1 to U5,” he added.\nHe also hoped they could be promoted without being transferred to Sabah or Sarawak, as vacancies and needs still exist at their current locations.\nAt the same time, he called on the government to consider granting a one-month bonus for civil servants in the upcoming budget.\nAccording to him, such an announcement was eagerly awaited by all civil servants, as the last time they enjoyed a special financial aid equivalent to one month’s salary was 12 years ago.\nHowever, he said civil servants were thankful for the eight per cent salary increase last December and a further seven per cent increase due next January.",
