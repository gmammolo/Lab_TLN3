  "text": "To create a safe space for victims to speak up, and for perpetrators to know that bullying is not ‘cool’, Royal Christian Academy, in President Park, held a successful anti-bullying campaign.\nThe campaign, under the theme: Say no to bullying, no to drugs – yes to a brighter future, was incorporated with anti-drug awareness, and took place at the school premises on August 29 for intermediate, senior, and FET phases, with the involvement of, and an address from, the Tshwarang Prevention and Awareness Treatment Centre (TPATC), formerly the South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (Sanca).\nTwo student-teachers and organisers, Bongekile Happiness Mlilo and Kebuakgalalelo Diutlwileng, said the campaign fostered a holistic approach to address bullying and drug awareness, by integrating it into the education space.\nRead more: City health department regrets woman giving birth outside Rabie Ridge Clinic\nMlilo said the purpose of the campaign was to create a safe, respectful, and inclusive school environment, where every learner feels valued and supported. “As a private school that upholds strong values of integrity, empathy, and community, we are committed to preventing all forms of bullying – verbal, physical, social, and cyber – through education, awareness, and proactive intervention.”\nEvent organisers flank young learners carrying placards at the school in President Park. Photo: Sphiwe Masilela Diutlwileng said bullying is not a private issue, but a shared responsibility. She said parents, guardians, leaders, and law enforcement are encouraged to participate and contribute to the curbing of bullying and drug abuse at schools. “This campaign aims to empower learners, staff, and families to recognise, report, and respond to bullying behaviours, fostering a culture of kindness, accountability, and mutual respect.”\nTPATC Ke Moja [I am cool] coaches Mpho Nonyani and Thandi Mabaso attended the event, with Nonyani addressing the learners about the effects of drug and alcohol abuse, as well as what they do as Ke Moja coaches.\nAlso read: Well wishes to Nizamiye Primary and High School ahead of exams\nDeputy head girl and Grade 10 learner Ashley Rossen said bullying affects many people, often in silence. “Bullying is not just teasing or joking around; it is when someone uses their power, words, or actions to hurt, shame, or control another person. The truth is, the pain caused by bullying doesn’t just go away. It can leave scars on someone’s heart and mind for years.”\nDeputy head girl Ashley Rossen addresses her peers during the campaign at the Royal Christian Academy.
