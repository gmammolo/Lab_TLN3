  "text": "The annual RFDS ‘Wings For Life’ Gala hosted in South Australia was the hottest ticket in town last Saturday, with 900 guests immersing themselves in the glitz and glamour of the 2021 theme – CLUB CABARET.\nHosted by RFDS ambassador Jessica Adamson, CLUB CABARET delivered a high-impact, unforgettable night of song, dance, burlesque and acrobatics including a spectacular headline performance by Australian star of the stage, Rachael Beck.\nIt is through the support of these attendees, along with our event sponsors, volunteers and prize donors, that the Flying Doctor was able to raise an incredible $300,000 (net) on the night.\nThese crucial funds will directly benefit our capital-raising program for the replacement of our 'flying intensive care units' so that we continue provide the finest care in the air.\nThank you to our amazing event and corporate partners - Beach Energy, OZ Minerals, Heathgate, Iluka, S. Kidman & Co, Ahrens, 7 News, SA Power Networks, MGA Whittles, Edible Blooms, Pilatus, Senex Energy, Elders, Hackett Foundation, BHP, IGA, DogRidge, Balco Australia, The Advertiser, Stock Journal, Coopers and WDM.",
