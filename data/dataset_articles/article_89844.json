  "text": "LANGKAWI, Sept 4 (Bernama) -- The inaugural ASEAN-EU Ministerial Dialogue on Environment and Climate Change, held here, has complemented ASEAN’s growing environmental agenda with the EU's leadership in setting ambitious climate targets and promoting environmental protection through initiatives like the European Green Deal and its commitment to carbon neutrality.\nActing Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Minister Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani said the dialogue is set to establish a framework for environmental cooperation, promote capacity building and technology transfer, and explore synergies in addressing shared challenges such as plastic pollution, biodiversity loss and climate change.\n“From circular economy initiatives to marine environment protection, from biodiversity conservation to climate resilience - our agenda today reflects the breadth and depth of cooperation possible between our regions.\n“The challenges we face - whether it's ending plastic pollution, protecting our oceans, or building climate resilience - require collective action that transcends geographical boundaries. Today, we begin building that collective response,” he said in his opening remarks at the dialogue at Langkawi International Convention Centre (LICC) here today.\nThe dialogue, co-chaired by Malaysia and the European Union (EU), highlights both regions’ commitment to environmental cooperation.\nMeanwhile, European Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, Wopke Bastiaan Hoekstra, reaffirmed the EU’s commitment to remain a trusted partner in advancing climate action, underscoring the urgency of stronger cooperation with ASEAN in addressing global environmental challenges.\nEurope and ASEAN share common ground in their outlook on geopolitics, trade and the environment, adding that such alignment is crucial in a world facing increasing turmoil.\n“Climate change will continue to affect every single corner of the earth and it needs to be a top priority. and it demands urgent action. If you look at the data, 2024 was the warmest year on record and the first to exceed 1.5 degrees (Celsius) above pre-industrial levels. Alarmingly, the pace of global climate action, unfortunately, remains too slow.\n“Everyone in your beautiful region, as well as in ours, is at the receiving end of what that means. So we have no choice; we do need to become more ambitious,” he said at the dialogue.\nThe three-day 18th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on the Environment (AMME-18), held from Tuesday, brings together ASEAN environment ministers and senior officials to discuss regional cooperation on sustainability and inclusive environmental management.\n-- BERNAMA\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial\n© 2025 BERNAMA\n• Disclaimer\n• Privacy Policy\n• Security Policy",
