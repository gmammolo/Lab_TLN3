  "text": "THE Port Moresby Soccer Association men’s premier division is picking-up steam as it heads into week 13 with seven matches remaining before the playoffs.\nPMSA general secretary George Bukoya said that the men’s premier division is shaping up well for the top four placing, with the reigning champions PS Ruts FC still in contention in sixth place.\nHeading the top four are Mungkas FC (24 points), Solomon United FC (23 points), Murat NCD FC (22 points) and FC Genesis (21 points).\nPS Ruts are on 14 points.\nBukoya said: “City Strikers, University and Blue Kumuls are also showing positive signs of making a last-minute dash to secure one of the four slots as well.\n“So, the pressure is definitely on,” he added.\nThis weekend will see, Solomon United take on Cloudy Bay, a revitalised Blue Kumuls will face Mungkas, University will have to play above themselves to contain Murat NCD, FC Genesis will take on Momase and PS Ruts will do battle with the City Strikers young guns, added Bukoya.\nIn the women’s premier division, Bismark and FC Genesis will have to dig deep to win their remining matches to unseat the top four.\n“Mungkas FC, University SC, and Finance are comfortable in the top three slots, while Murat will have to stay consistent to secure the fourth spot,” Bukoya said.\nThe women’s competition has been tightly contested with very good consistent performances from Murat NCD, Kurti Andra, PS Ruts and Borders, he said.\n“The top teams will be hard to topple, but things can change when it comes to the business end of the competition.\n“Mungkas will have to deny PS Ruts if they want to remain at the top, while theoretically University SC should not struggle to overcome City Strikers.\n“But again, that is not set in stone.\n“The City Strikers maidens may stage an upset and stun University SC as well.”",
