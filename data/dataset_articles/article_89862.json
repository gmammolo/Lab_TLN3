  "text": "Frankie Plutz, who attends Jefferson Elementary School, is one of only five students nationwide to win tickets to the big game in February 2026.\nThe Packers believed in Golden enough to depart from their usual draft strategy by making him the first receiver they've selected in the first round since 2002.\nLambeau Field has historically been a house of horrors for the Lions, with the Packers holding an all-time 62-30-4 record against Detroit on their home field.\nWhile Labor Day weekend tends to be the unofficial end to summer, Labor Day is the unofficial start to the Packers regular season.\nThe trade potentially gives the Packers one of the league’s best pass rushing tandems in Parsons and Rashan Gary\nMicah Parsons wore a Packers uniform for the first time during Monday's practice. Wearing the number one, the former Cowboy looked happy to be in Green Bay.\nMicah Parsons says he's excited to be in Green Bay and ready to become a dominant player for the Packers\nThe Packers' newest star is asking fans which jersey number he should wear.",
