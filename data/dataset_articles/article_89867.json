  "text": "Preliminary harvest totals are 5.2% higher than last year. DNR State Deer Program Specialist Jeff Pritzl calls the nine-day gun hunting campaign a success.\nPritzl says overall, this gun deer season was a little above the five-year average in harvest.\nPreliminary figures show hunters registered 189,622 deer during the 2024 gun deer season, including 89,787 antlered and 99,835 antlerless deer.\nAlthough preliminary harvest totals for Deer Hunt 2024 aren't expected until Tuesday, many hunters are already getting their deer processed into venison.\nIt's been 10 years since the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources implemented a deer management system based on county lines.\nCWD is fatal and highly contagious. It impacts the nervous systems of deer, elk, moose and caribou, so properly disposing of deer carcasses is key.\nThe preliminary numbers are in for opening weekend of Deer Hunt 2024.\nMore hunters bought licenses compared to last year, but they bagged slightly fewer deer during opening weekend of this year's gun hunting season.",
