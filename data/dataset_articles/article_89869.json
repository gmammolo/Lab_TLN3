  "text": "A couple of youngsters made good on their last day of vacation before school, while a veteran of the League couldn’t hit the ground if he fell out of the cart. A team made up of Sean The Rookie Fletcher, Gabby Gavin Bruzzi, and Rick Marsh Mellow ended up + 17.5.\nWhat happens when they add Winston into the mix? Well, they are now +11.,5, which was enough to claim victory. Winston offered to pay somebody to take his putter off his hands, the major reason he had 12 bogeys, nine in a row on his way to a -6. The savior of this club was Marsh Mellow, who ended up +10.5. That was enough to give him the most over points. Winners get $12.\nThe Dumpster team had a guy who might have turned in one of the most pitiful performances since The Tapper carded a 105 and was -12. None other than Pistol Pete Columb swung his way around the course, shooting a 103 and ending up -8.5. Bone was on this club, which is enough to give anyone the shakes. Jim Shank Hemingway and Larry Harley Wilson took themselves out of the running for the Invisible Man Award by collecting a Dumpster. The team finished -9 with Pistol winning the Crash and Burn Trophy. Last week, he finished first. Where are you, Hitchhiker Sears?\nA guy who we haven’t seen in at least a month won the closest to pin on #6 with a shot of 1’ 2” away. Larry the Lyons claims he was on assignment, and if he told us where, he’d have to kill us.\nOne would think that running this League would involve a committee of 10 people, a huge computer, and plenty of alcohol. Wrong. It consists of two people, one of whom is the brains behind the operation. Bone caught up with “Lisa” to find out what her deal is.\nBone: “So, Lisa, where did you learn how to run The League?”\nLisa: “An insane asylum.”\nBone: “Wowser. An insane asylum. How did you get here?”\nLisa: “I escaped.”\nBone: “You escaped…My, that’s a big hatchet you have.”\nOn a safer note, there were six skins this week, paying $7 each. Gabby Gavin on #1, Haulin’ Dahlin on #4 and #9, Marsh Mellow on #8, Ringo Jacobs on #12, and Dan Whiffer Babcock on #14.\nLast official week, next week, when the guys use only three clubs. Who could forget Stormin’ Norman Sarthou when he used two wedges and a three wood for his clubs? He averaged four putts per hole. Additionally, the Invisible Man will be unveiled, possibly accompanied by an interview with Bone. Hope to see you all next week.",
