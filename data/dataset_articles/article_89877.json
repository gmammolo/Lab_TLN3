  "text": "The Royal Flying Doctor Service is now “on tap” at the iconic William Creek Hotel.\nThe watering hole – a popular pit-stop for outback holiday-makers exploring the Oodnadatta Track in South Australia’s far north – is one of the newest locations to house an RFDS Tap ‘n’ Go donation machine.\nMore than 100 patrons have already tapped their credit or debit cards to make an instant $2 donation to the Flying Doctor since the Tap ‘n’ Go was installed late last year.\nThe pub is no stranger to supporting the life-saving work of the Royal Flying Doctor Service.\nOver more than two decades, its staff and patrons have raised more than $54,000 through traditional donation tins and front bar challenges.\n“William Creek is one of Australia's most remote locations and the RFDS is an integral part of our business and the outback,” William Creek Hotel owner Trevor Wright said.\n“Knowing we have the support of the RFDS provides enormous confidence to businesses and farmers to continue to trade, operate and invest – not to mention the tourism industry.\n“Every day, Australians continue to travel and explore our great country knowing the Flying Doctor is just a phone call away if needed.\n“Our experience first-hand is that the RFDS is at the forefront of modern medical practices and is constantly improving its services to assist outback residents who need to undertake critical initial assessments while flight crews are on their way to help. When you’re over 800 kilometres from the nearest hospital, every minute counts.”\nRFDS Central Operations currently has 60 Tap ‘n’ Go donation machines active in South Australia and the Northern Territory and is on the look-out for new locations.\nIf you are interested in installing a Tap ‘n’ Go supporting the Flying Doctor at your local business, please contact Kristen Newlyn at kristen.newlyn@flyingdoctor.net.\nPictured: Wrightsair pilot Mariano Salvati with hotel caretaker Rose Broughton at William Creek Hotel.",
