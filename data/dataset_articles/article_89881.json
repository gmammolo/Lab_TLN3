  "title": "GST reforms: Grocery essentials to be cheaper by nearly 15% - The Economic Times",
  "text": "Prices of almost all grocery essentials including biscuits, soaps, noodles, coffee and butter are set to become cheaper by 10-15% because of the GST reforms announced on Wednesday. This is likely to spur demand and drive volume growth across the board in the FMCG sector, which has been facing demand headwinds over the past five quarters as inflation-impacted consumers cut back on consumption and competition heated up from regional players. More products will move into the organised sector. Dairy products such as cheese, butter and ice-cream have significantly lower penetration in India compared to western markets, so with lower prices now, we see a huge opportunity for these categories, said Jayen Mehta, MD of GCMMF, which makes Amul milk, cheese, butter and ice-cream. He said Amul will start reducing prices upfront and put new stocks in retail trade as soon as possible.While tax slabs of butter, cheese, confectionery and salty snacks have been cut to 5% from 12%, GST on chocolates, biscuits, corn flakes, coffee, ice-cream, bottled water, hair oil, shampoo, soaps, shaving cream and toothpaste have been slashed to 5% from 18%.The GST rate on sugary aerated drinks has been hiked from 28% to 40%. However, even prior to Wednesday's announcement, all aerated drinks, including no-sugar, low-sugar and fruit-based drinks, were taxed at 28% in addition to 12% compensation cess, taking overall to 40%. So, there will be no net impact on the consumer prices of these products, which come under sin tax category.Analysts said they expect stocks of all listed FMCG companies, such as Hindustan Unilever, Britannia, Dabur, Marico, ITC and Nestle to benefit. This will be a game changer for consumption. We expect at least 10-13% price cuts in most categories, said Mayank Shah, vice-president at Parle Products.The All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation, which represents over 450,000 distributors and 13 million kirana retailers, said the sweeping reforms will ease pressure on trade and strengthen supply chain.",
