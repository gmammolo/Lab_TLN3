  "text": "NO VISA, a genre-agnostic dance party series, has taken to Tokyo, Johannesburg,and Brooklyn — but the North Carolina scene remains their creative heartbeat.\nOn Aug. 23, NO VISA hosted a sold-out party at PS37, a pop-up venue in Durham, in partnership with London promoter and global dance music community, Keep Hush, which films and archives raves around the world.\nNO VISA co-founders and brothers Alec Lomami and Mike Tambashe — who also run a music management company, Immaculate Taste — have brought underground headliners like Baltimore’s JIALING and Atlanta’s Nikki Nair to their parties. But for the Keep Hush collaboration, the brothers prioritized spotlighting local talent and making the event free for all.\nLomami was born in Belgium, raisein Congo and eventually settled in Hillsborough to join Tambashe and their father.\nA desire to spotlight Francophone dance music informed Lomami's early forays into live mixing, and he continues to feature sounds from West Africa at NO VISA and his other DJ ventures.\nNO VISA’s tagline, “No immigration paper needed, just a will to dance,” speaks to the brothers’ dedication to international music and building a border-defying community.\nThe concept behind NO VISA came from Lomami’s experience in a detention center for undocumented immigrants where he witnessed music as a healing force.\n“That was a real, tangible example of what music can do,” Lomami said. “In that horrible place, you will still have these moments of joy and bringing people together.”\nThe name ‘NO VISA’ does not just refer to the series’ transcendence of geographic and genric boundaries. It also alludes to the diversity of music played – at any given party, one could hear K-pop, UK jungle and 2000s crunk all at once.",
