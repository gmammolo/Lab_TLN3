LOUIS — The family and friends of Jarvis McIntyre, who tragically vanished and was found deceased in San Antonio, Texas, lit up the sky with lanterns Thursday night in a powerful tribute, seeking justice and closure.\n“We are definitely seeking justice for him because, at the moment, they say there is no foul play. But clearly, there is. His body was actually decomposed,” said Monikki Williams-Tippet, mother of McIntyre.\nMcIntyre, a 26-year-old from St. Louis, traveled to San Antonio on June 6th to visit family. Two days later, someone last spotted him jogging in John James Park.\n“He was off; I don’t believe he was jogging in the park. If they saw him running, he was running from somebody in the park,” said Williams-Tippet.\nClose Thanks for signing up!\nWatch for us in your inbox.\nSubscribe Now\nDaily News",
