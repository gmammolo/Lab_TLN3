Newsroom Reviewed\nTeachers' Day, celebrated on Sept. 5 in India, marks the birth anniversary of renowned scholar and philosopher and the second President of India, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. It is a day when students express their gratitude toward their teachers and honour their contribution to society.\nThe origin of this day dates back to 1962, when a few students of Dr. Radhakrishnan wished to celebrate his birthday. However, he requested that the day be observed as Teachers’ Day instead. Since then, Teachers’ Day has become a nationwide observance, honouring Dr. Radhakrishnan’s lifelong devotion to learning and his invaluable role in shaping modern India.\nDr. Radhakrishnan stands as a towering figure in modern India's intellectual landscape. Celebrated for his profound philosophical insights and distinguished academic career, he went on to serve as the nation’s second President from 1962 to 1967.\nWho Was Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan? Born on Sept. 5, 1888, in a small town in present-day Andhra Pradesh, Dr. Radhakrishnan rose from humble beginnings to become a global figure in the field of philosophy and earned respect as both a scholar and a statesman.\nALSO READ Teachers' Day 2025: History, Significance, Celebrations And All You Need To Know Opinion Teachers' Day 2025: History, Significance, Celebrations And All You Need To Know Read More Throughout his professional life, he emphasised the importance of education as a tool for national progress and cultural identity. His leadership brought dignity to India and reflected his commitment to moral values and intellectual thought.\nDr. Radhakrishnan pursued higher studies at Christian College, Madras, where his brilliance as a student was quickly recognised.\nHe later built an academic career teaching in some of the country’s leading institutions, such as the University of Mysore and the University of Calcutta. His reputation as a profound thinker on philosophy and religion eventually took him abroad, where he was appointed as the Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at the University of Oxford. It was a role through which he introduced Indian philosophical traditions to a global audience.\nDr. Radhakrishnan also played an important role in India’s political life. Between 1949 and 1952, he represented India as its Ambassador in the Soviet Union, playing a crucial role in strengthening diplomatic ties during a challenging period in global politics.\nFollowing this, he served as the country’s first Vice-President from 1952 to 1962. Thereafter, he was elevated to the highest office of the country, becoming the President of India.\nIn 1954, Dr. Radhakrishnan received the Bharat Ratna, the nation’s highest civilian honour, in recognition of his outstanding service to the nation.\nHis intellectual stature was widely recognised on the international stage as well. This is clear from the fact that he was nominated for the Nobel Prize 27 times: 16 times for Literature and 11 times for the Peace Prize.\nDr. Radhakrishnan breathed his last on April 17, 1975, leaving behind a rich legacy of thought and service.\nALSO READ Teacher's Day 2025 Speech Ideas: Five Short Speeches In English For School Students Opinion Teacher's Day 2025 Speech Ideas: Five Short Speeches In English For School Students Read More",
