  "text": "The Grade 10C class at Banz Lutheran Day Secondary School is raising funds for a class picnic.\nThe students set up stalls at the school’s pre-independence celebration, where they sold groceries and offered face painting for a fee of 50t.\nThe money they earn will go toward their picnic.\nAccording to school principal Terence Tai, other classes are also holding similar fundraising events at the celebration.\nMr Tai said it was not only the 10c but other classes are doing the same",
