  "text": "Pride Week, Competitive Biking Month, and Constitution Week proclaimed by the Grand Junction City Council\nGRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (KKCO) - Three proclamations were made at the Grand Junction City Council’s regular meeting on September 3.\nThe council proclaimed September 17-23, 2025, as Constitution Week to honor the principles of the Constitution for the United States of America.\nThe council proclaimed September 2-7, 2025, as Grand Junction Pride Week. According to Jon Michael Nitschke, Board President of Colorado West Pride, it’s an honor to be recognized for the work they do.\n“The work that we do is hard and it’s important and it means so much to our community, to ourselves, to the people who work with us,” said Nitschke. “So being able to stand in front of elected officials and share our gratitude for that, being able to talk to them about the importance of the work we do, and be able to celebrate with our community means everything.”\nFor the remainder of the week, Colorado West Pride will host a series of events celebrating the LGBTQIA+ community. More information on their events can be found here.\nThe council also proclaimed September as Competitive Cycling and Tour of the Moon Month to recognize the cultural value of cycling in the community.\nI think the more we can do to promote the Grand Valley and all the municipalities as destinations for cyclist-friendly communities, the better off we stand to be in the long run, said Chandler Smith, Co-Owner & Director for the Ride Collective. On September 13, the Ride Collective will host the 13th annual Tour of the Moon, a cycling event that will bring riders along the Colorado National Monument. Smith anticipates 1,500 to 2,000 people will ride in the event.\n“It has an economic impact of about $1 million over the course of the weekend through lodging, retail, and dining. We have a number of charity groups that we engage with, and they help support staff, aid stations, and course marshals. So there’s a charitable arm to this,” said Smith.\nMore information on Tour of the Moon can be found here. Registration ends on September 7.\nCopyright 2025 KKCO. All rights reserved.",
