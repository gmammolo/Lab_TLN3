  "text": ":::\nTaiwan Golden Hand Award Winners Take Part in Educational Exchanges in London\nThe Golden Hand Award is a competition that recognises excellence and outstanding achievements in vocational education in Taiwan across fields such as engineering, business, robotics, and computer maintenance. The competition attracts thousands of entrants from more than 150 vocational schools across Taiwan each year.\nA visit to the UK and a program of educational exchanges were arranged for the winners of the 2025 Golden Hand Award competition with the assistance of the Education Division of the Taipei Representative Office in the UK. During their time in London, a delegation including the seven Golden Hand Award-winning vocational education students, their mentors and educators, and officials from the New Taipei City Government Education Department visited the Angel campus of Capital City College on May 20, 2025.\nThe delegation was greeted by Mr. Saeesh Shirsat, the Angel centre’s Curriculum Leader in Engineering, and the visiting students from Taiwan took part in a collaborative robotics workshop with a group of seven students in the college’s Engineering – Level 3 Diploma program. After watching a demonstration, the students from Taiwan and the UK worked together on a number of tasks, which included making a solar-powered charger and controlling robots competing against each other to navigate an obstacle course in the shortest time. Despite the language barrier and different cultural backgrounds, the Taiwanese and UK students worked together effectively, demonstrating their strong problem-solving and technical skills, and sharing their enthusiasm for engineering.\nThe workshop was an invaluable way to enhance all the participating students’ global perspectives and prepare them for the demands of practical collaboration as part of a globalised workforce. It also illustrated the benefits of cross-border partnerships in vocational education: the teachers accompanying the visiting students also enjoyed the workshop and interacting with the Angel centre teachers. Taiwan is strongly committed to international educational collaboration, and the Education Division of the Taipei Representative Office in the UK will continue to help connect schools and institutions at all educational levels in Taiwan and in the UK.",
