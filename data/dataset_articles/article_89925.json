  "text": "- Dr Michael Schaper appointed deputy chairperson to Infrastructure WA board\n- Dr Schaper brings extensive experience in governance, regulatory oversight and public policy\nThe Western Australian Government has appointed Dr Michael Schaper as deputy chairperson of the Infrastructure WA (IWA) board.\nDr Schaper brings extensive experience in governance, regulatory oversight and public policy, having held senior roles including deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, chair of the Gaming and Wagering Commission of WA, and chairperson of the Energy and Water Ombudsman WA.\nDr Schaper’s background strongly aligns with IWA’s mission to provide independent advice, promote transparent decision-making and support better outcomes for the people and economy of WA.\nHis appointment comes at a pivotal time for IWA, as consultation is underway to establish a WA Productivity Commission through a merge of key functions of IWA and the Economic Regulation Authority. Dr Schaper’s expertise will support the Board’s continued focus on strategic infrastructure planning and independent advice to government.\nIWA is governed by an independent board comprising of up to 10 members, combining the expertise of both the public and private sectors, and provides strategic policy direction and oversight of major infrastructure proposal investment decisions.\nLearn more about IWA and the board at www.infrastructure.wa.gov.au\nAs stated by Premier Roger Cook:\n“I thank the Hon Jay Weatherill AO and Ms Rebecca Tomkinson for their valued service to IWA. Their leadership has helped shape the agency’s direction and laid a strong foundation for its future.\n“It’s a pleasure to welcome Dr Michael Schaper to the role of deputy chairperson. His experience will be a valuable asset as IWA evolves into to the WA Productivity Commission and continues its work to shape the State’s infrastructure priorities.”\nAs stated by the Infrastructure WA chairperson Nicole Lockwood:\n“On behalf of the IWA board and team, I thank Jay and Rebecca for their insight and commitment. Their contributions have been instrumental in shaping IWA’s work and strategic direction.\n“We wish Rebecca all the best as she steps into her new role representing Western Australia in the UK and Europe, and Jay with his ongoing work to promote a more respectful and solutions-focused political culture.\n“I am delighted to welcome Dr Michael Schaper to the board as deputy chairperson. His appointment comes at an important time for IWA, as we prepare for our next phase of evolution.\n“Dr Schaper’s breadth of experience will help guide our next phase with the WA Productivity Commission and ensure we remain focused on delivering independent, strategic advice that benefits all Western Australians.”\n[here].",
