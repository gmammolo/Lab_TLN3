  "text": "By Delesha Banks ,\n1 hours ago\nJACKSON, Miss. ( WJTV ) – The Greater Pearlie Grove Missionary Baptist Church Boy Scouts Troop 291 is making positive efforts to impact Jackson communities.\nThe boys and young men who make up the troop all share a common goal of exemplifying leadership one community project at a time.\n“What it means me to be a scout is being someone in the community that helps out when no one else helps out. Instead of just looking at past, you go right there and help the person,” said Kaleb Moffett, a historian for the troop.\nThe scouts work hard to uphold their oath, which is to do their best and help others at all times. Since 2023, the troop has led service projects, including cleaning up the Georgetown Virden Addition and serving with organizations like Stewpot. Volunteering helps the scouts earn badges and move up in rank.\nIHL seeks executive search firms for Jackson State president search “Not only just does this program teach things like, camping skills and the like, but it also teaches them how to work with others. And also, citizenship is a really big part of that, being a member of your community, nation and world. It is very important in this program,” said Charles Weiss, the assistant scout master.\nCraig Thomas, who is the troop leader, has been part of the Boy Scouts since he was five. He felt it was his duty to pay it forward.\n“It means everything to me because at the end of the day. A lot of youth get pulled in different directions. They get pulled into a lot of bad things. We need more good things in the community like Boy Scouts and more organizations that do great things for the community,” Thomas said.\nThe troop is always open for new members.\nClose Thanks for signing up!\nWatch for us in your inbox.\nSubscribe Now\nDaily News Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
