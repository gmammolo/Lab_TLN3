  "text": "The continued weakness in the labour market has all but guaranteed a 25 bps rate cut at the September FOMC meeting.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics published its July JOLTS report on Wednesday, revealing that job openings stood at just 7.181 million, below the estimated 7.380 million.\nThis marks the lowest JOLTS reading since March 2021.\nThe downside risk in the labour market has now become a bigger concern for the Federal Reserve than the elevated inflation levels, as also indicated by Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his last month’s Jackson Hole address.\nUnsurprisingly, the CME FedWatch is now showing 98% odds of a September rate cut, also forecasting another cut later this year. There is even a 41.5% probability of three rate cuts in 2025.\nThis is a decidedly bullish scenario for risk assets. Crypto prices are showing bullish strength, with Bitcoin and Ethereum hitting $112,000 and $4,500, respectively. MemeCore, Four, OKB and Virtuals Protocol are also among the top crypto gainers.\nAmong the meme coins, SPX6900 and Dogecoin are in the green as well.\nWhy Crypto Prices Are Reacting Positively To July JOLTS Report? Crypto assets tend to react positively to loose monetary policy. With the continued weakness in the US labour market, the US Federal Reserve is now forced to aggressively cut the Federal target rate and adopt quantitative easing.\nFor instance, the number of job openings per unemployed person just fell below 1. Simply put, there are now fewer jobs than the people looking for them.\nThis is a metric often cited by Fed Chair Powell, suggesting the central bank may be compelled to cut rates in order to bolster economic growth.\nThe number of job openings per unemployed worker (a metric that Powell references a lot) just fell below 1.\nThis means there are now fewer job openings than there are people who are looking for a job.\nThis will almost certainly lock in the rate cut for September. pic.twitter.com/6PEFrG0cCL\n— Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) September 3, 2025 Unsurprisingly, the CME FedWatch reveals that two rate cuts are all but guaranteed for this year, while a third rate cut is also possible. This is a decidedly bullish scenario for crypto assets.\nCrypto Prices Are Pumping, These Altcoins Are Among The Top Gainers The Bitcoin price hit $112,000 on Wednesday after the JOLTS report release, while Ethereum climbed above the $4,500 mark.\nBoth BTC and ETH are on the cusp of major breakouts; however, they haven’t secured it just yet.\nSolana continues to be one of the strongest large-cap altcoins on the market, trading comfortably over $200 mark.\nSimilarly, the Dogecoin price successfully defended the $0.20 support level, now trading at $0.216 at press time.\nEthereum ecosystem coins are showing considerable bullish strength as well, with Aave, Etherena and Pende among the top gainers. This shows excellent relative strength, indicating that these will be among the top performers once the broader market outlook improves.\nSolana meme coin SPX6900 is also in the green.\nBest Cryptos To Buy Now Despite the rallying crypto prices, sidelined investors should exercise caution in making any new investment. In fact, they should wait for a weekly close above the $113,000 level for Bitcoin, and $4,500 for Ethereum, even before investing in altcoins.\nHowever, they can buy low-cap cryptos, considering they do not show any correlation with the broader market outlook.\nFor instance, the new layer-2 coin, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) , is quickly nearing the $14 million milestone in its viral presale. It is designed to tackle the poor network throughput and scalability on Bitcoin, bringing the efficiency and programmability of modern blockchains.\nWith utility coins finally showing strength, layer-2 coins like HYPER are among the most attractive investments. It is not without reason that whales continue to pour six-figure investments into HYPER.\nBesides its cutting-edge layer-2 architecture and integration with the Solana Virtual Machine, HYPER boasts community-centric tokenomics, safe smart contracts and attractive staking rewards.\nIn fact, many of the early Bitcoin Hyper buyers are eying up to 100x returns from it.\nVisit Bitcoin Hyper Presale\nThis article has been provided by one of our commercial partners and does not reflect Cryptonomist’s opinion.
