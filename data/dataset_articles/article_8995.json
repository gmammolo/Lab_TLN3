The crossing restored access to villages that were isolated due to ongoing heavy rains in the region.\n“Despite challenging conditions, the bridge was completed in less than 48 hours, ensuring connectivity and facilitating relief,” a spokesperson for the army said.\nIn the video released by the armed forces, engineers can be seen resolutely continuing work despite water rushing down at tremendous speeds.\nAccording to the Trishkti Corps, the part of the army that carried out the work, the water flowed at speeds of over 20 knots (37 kph). The Trishakti Corps is a part of the army’s eastern command with its headquarter in Siliguri, a major city in West Bengal state.\n#WeCare Indian Army Engineers restored foot connectivity by constructing a 150 feet foot suspension bridge in North #Sikkim to re-connect the border villages which got cutoff due to continued heavy rains.

Over 1,200 tourists stranded by rains and landslides have been rescued by the state government. The Trishakti Corps has featured prominently in the rescue missions.\nREAD MORE: New Delhi to review army recruitment policy – media Last October, heavy rains caused the glacial South Lhonak lake in Sikkim to overflow, causing a flood.
