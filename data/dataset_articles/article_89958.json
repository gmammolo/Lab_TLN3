  "text": "LANSING — The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) has launched a statewide MI Options system, offering free and comprehensive person-centered options counseling for adults looking for long-term care services and supports. Medicare counseling is also offered through the State Health Insurance Assistance Program and Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act program for those navigating enrollment or reenrollment.\n“MDHHS is excited to launch this statewide platform to increase the understanding and awareness of long-term care supports and services, including home and community-based options,” said Elizabeth Hertel, MDHHS director. “By providing counseling on topics from Medicare enrollment and prescription cost options to aging in place, individuals across the state will be empowered to make the best choices for their health and well-being.”\nMichigan residents can call 800-803-7174, 8 a.m.-8 p.m., Monday through Friday, to speak with an agent who can then schedule an appointment or provide a referral to a trained, certified counselor in their community.\nThere is no cost to the individual or caregiver for this service. The new MI Options system supports older adults and people with disabilities, providing information to help individuals make informed decisions and exercise control over their long-term care needs by incorporating their personal goals and preferences.\nMI Options provides counseling through a network of community-based providers and partners who were identified by a statewide Grant Funding Opportunity. These include regional Agencies on Aging, Centers for Independent Living and local nonprofit organizations.\nPerson-centered options counseling can help with:\n• Exploring long-term care and support options for adults, including home and community-based services.\n• Identifying next steps after a major life event to better understand what services and supports are available.\n• Building actionable steps for pursuing options that align with an individual’s preferences and values.\nMedicare counseling can help with:\n• Medicare enrollment assistance.\n• Medicare and Medicaid coordination.\n• Discussions on cost savings, including low-income subsidies.\n• Prescription drug coverage options.\n• Billing questions.\n• Benefits explanation.\nThe 2024 Home and Community Preferences Survey from the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) indicates that at least 75% of Americans age 50-plus would like to live in their current homes as long as possible. However, new findings from the 2025 University of Michigan National Poll on Healthy Aging reveal a wide variation in what adults age 65 and older have done, or intend to do, to ensure their homes will meet their needs as they grow older. MI Options counseling can assist individuals in identifying the steps and resources needed to stay happily and safely in their homes and communities longer.\n“Too many people wait until the point of crisis to seek out this kind of information,” said Scott Wamsley, director of MDHHS’ Bureau of Aging, Community Living, and Supports. “Beginning these conversations earlier, with the assistance of trained counselors, can help alleviate some of the confusion and anxiety.”\nThe statewide call center will allow individuals to schedule appointments to meet with a counselor in a setting of their choice in their local community.\nTo reach a MI Options counselor or to find out more information about the MI Options program in Michigan, call 800-803-7174 or visit Michigan.gov/MDHHSMIOptions.",
