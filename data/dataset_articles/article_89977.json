  "text": "Abuse charity issues advice for people with secret phones ahead of emergency alert test\nA second Government alert test is being carried out on Sunday (7/9)\nWiltshire's domestic abuse charity is advising people experiencing abuse, who have a secret second phone, to take steps to stop it being identified during this weekend's emergency alert test.\nAn alarm is being sent out on Sunday at 3pm through our smartphones as part of preparations for a national crisis.\nThe alerts will provide a warning and advice in a life-threatening situation.\nThey'll make us aware of wildfires, severe flooding and extreme storms in our area and will be sent by either emergency services or government departments dealing with emergencies.\nFearFree says it could pose a risk to people with concealed phones having them exposed.\nCEO Debbie Beadle said: \"I can imagine how people have worried if they've got a phone that you know how they explained that. Would that raise questions? And it may be there is the likelihood of this being identified if they were in the room that it's in.\n\"So yes, it would be a concern for many people.\"\nPeople can opt-out of the alerts, by changing the settings on their phone, but the charity has further advice for people.\n\"If there was an opportunity to move the phone in a different location that maybe it wouldn't be heard for that time that potentially is an option,\" Debbie said.\nShe added that, if possible and safe to do so, to pass the secret phone to a friend.\nAnyone feeling unsafe is urged to contact emergency services.\nHear all the latest news from across the UK on the hour, every hour, on Greatest Hits Radio on DAB, smartspeaker, at greatesthitsradio.co.uk, and on the Rayo app.",
