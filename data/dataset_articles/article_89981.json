  "text": "SPENCER — A group from the Eureka Lodge in Salisbury presented a check to North Rowan Elementary School on Wednesday.\nThe donation of $500 will go toward student support specialist Cynthia Rice’s role in providing continued support and basic needs for Steamer students.\n“Basic needs are things our students need, like school supplies and clothing,” Rice said. “Sometimes, they don’t have the clothing that is sufficient for them to be at school.”\nThis is the second year that the Eureka Lodge has partnered with North Rowan Elementary School to offer assistance.\n“These gentlemen, they said, ‘Well what do you need Ms. Rice for the students?’” Rice said. “And I said, ‘Well a lot of times it is clothing.’ They see we have the school supplies. They were specific when they asked what we needed and a lot of the time it is the clothing. Students may have an accident at school like a nosebleed. Some have other accidents like tearing their clothes or falling in mud, or whatever. Sometimes, we don’t have those items to give the students.”\nRice said that monetary donations are especially helpful because it permits them the discretionary ability to pick things the school might need more than others.\n“Sometimes, we run out of clothing, but we may have plenty of school supplies, but we don’t have the other basic needs for students,” Rice said.\nLodge member Jeff Roberts said the money came through contributions collected in the organization.\n“We don’t do any type of fundraisers to get this money, it just comes out of our pocket,” Roberts said. “We are an organization here to serve the community and that is what we try to do.\n“This is our second partnership with North Rowan Elementary and we look forward to serving them again so long as we can.”\nFor one of the members, Wednesday represented a homecoming. Ernest Dunlap attended North Rowan Elementary as a young child. His mother was also a teacher there.\n“I’m very familiar with the school,” he said.\nRev. Ervin Hannah added, “Sometimes money doesn’t come in and support does not come in as it should, so we do what we can to be an encouragement to other organizations in the community.”",
