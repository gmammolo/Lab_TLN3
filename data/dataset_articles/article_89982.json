  "text": "It’s been just over three months since the Skubu project opened its doors at Chuma Mall, and Manzi Water is already celebrating the early success of South Africa’s first fully automated refill store, a bold step forward in retail innovation, community service, and a possible end to single use plastics.\nThe shop, located on a corner facing the parking lot at Chuma Mall in the heart of Diepsloot, has been bustling since launch. Customers flock daily to purchase basics from smart dispenser machines that allow them to buy goods in the exact quantities they need, using their own containers.\nBefore shopping, customers purchase a card for R10, a once-off payment, which they load with money for purchases. They then use the self-service machines to fill their bottles and buckets with water or groceries, choosing the quantity that suits their household needs.\nRead more: Community rallies to help remove cancerous kidney\nSeveral reports highlight how residents of Diepsloot are embracing the new store, citing both affordability and flexibility as key factors. Ngwako Ramathoka, a resident from Diepsloot, said they can now go to bed with full stomachs for just R50, thanks to the pricing and the ability to purchase items in quantities that suit their budgets.\nA resident lines up with their containers at the newly opened Skubu automated refill store in Diepsloot. Photo: Supplied “Things can be tough at times, and every cent counts. With Skubu, I can decide exactly how much I want to spend, even if it’s just R10. That means I never leave empty-handed. For people struggling to make ends meet, that’s a big relief.”\nDesigned as a next-generation grocery store, Skubu combines Manzi Water’s refill station with everyday essentials, all accessible through an automated self-service system. True to its mission, the store offers safe, clean drinking water at just R1 per litre.\n“In just a few weeks, we’ve seen growth in support and usage from the Diepsloot community,” said Alfred Challis, CEO of Manzi Water. “It proves that if you offer affordable, high-quality options, consumers will choose sustainability every time.”\nA residents wait in line with their containers at Diepsloot’s recently opened Skubu automated refill station.

Local Manzi Water licensees have also played a critical role in bringing the project to life, reinforcing the company’s commitment to community-based entrepreneurship and affordable hydration.\nEben de Jongh, CEO of Sonke said:“Skubu is not just another store; it is a statement. It is about restoring dignity through affordable access to essentials and giving people control over their choices. We are proud to see how this model is already changing lives in Diepsloot, and we are eager to learn from this pilot as we explore what is possible for other communities.”\nFollow us on our Whatsapp channel , Facebook , X , Instagram and TikTok for the latest updates",
