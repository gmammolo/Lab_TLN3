  "text": "In April, Parole Agents Huey and Whittaker were working in Chico when they noticed two men attempting to render aid on an unconscious man. Huey took action, heading to the scene while his partner called 911. Assessing the victim, Huey thought he might need CPR, then he spotted one of the men with an empty Narcan canister. After discovering the man may have overdosed on drugs, the people who were helping at the scene told Huey they had only administered one Narcan dose. Immediately, Huey gave the man two additional doses while waiting for emergency medical services (EMS) to arrive. The agent could see the victim, while unconscious, was beginning to breathe again. Once EMS arrived and began to transport the man to the hospital, the victim regained consciousness. When asked about his experience, Huey stated said he could remain calm due to the training he received through the Department. “With the ever-growing unfortunate drug addiction and drug use in our community, I am sad to say we see it frequently,” he said. Huey has been trained in Narcan use and is also a CPR/First Aid instructor. The Division of Adult Parole Operations extends appreciation and thanks to the quick actions of Agents Huey and Whittaker.
