  "text": "LSU lands commitment from four-star Bryli Seifert\nLSU currently holds the highest-ranked 2026 class, and the Tigers didn’t wait long for the 2027 group to start Callin’ Baton Rouge. Bryli Seifert, the 32nd overall recruit and a four-star infielder in our 2027 class rankings, announced her pledge to Beth Torina’s program.\n“The LSU staff stood out to me because every time I stepped on campus, they made it feel like home,” Seifert said. “My conversations are always easy with them. I feel comfortable talking to the entire staff about anything, even if it’s not softball-related.”\nSeifert made her commitment before the window for commits to make visits, but she plans to head to Baton Rouge next weekend, likely getting to watch LSU football’s SEC opener against Florida. LSU has sought out hitters who typically control the zone, being tough outs and forcing competitive at-bats, making this a good fit all around.\nGet the Daily On3 Newsletter in your inbox every morning\nBy clicking \"Subscribe to Newsletter\", I agree to On3's Privacy Notice, Terms, and use of my personal information described therein.\n“Bryli is an absolute competitor. She has an elite presence in the box, an uncanny ability to process and adjust pitch to pitch, and swings it with plus power to all fields,” said Bob Turner, Top Gun National Program Director. “(She’s an) elite player, but also one of the hardest workers and most coachable kids you’ll find anywhere. Very proud of her.”\nLSU still has another commitment that has yet to be made public and will be very active with the high-end prospects over the next few weeks.\nMore from Softball America:",
