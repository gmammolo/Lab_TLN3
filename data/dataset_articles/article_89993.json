  "text": "VIENNA — People who can’t make the township’s regular meetings no longer need to worry about missing any highlights.\nTrustees at Tuesday’s regular meeting approved the installation of a video recording system in the township’s town hall through Warren-based Mr. PC Inc., with its value not to exceed $3,000. Trustee Mike Haddle said the decision to install such a program has been discussed for a while and the township has the money to do it.\n“It will eliminate a lot of problems. It will also act as our meeting minutes; he (Mr. PC) gave us a quote, it’s two pivoted camera heads with a microphone system,” Haddle said.\nHaddle said meetings will be uploaded to a Cloud-type system, where officials can livestream or share the links via social media, or even put the links on the township’s website so officials can track them that way.\nRecordings will begin as soon as the system is installed.\nSTOLEN STOP SIGNS\nTrustee Phil Pegg reported that another stop sign was stolen in the township, continuing a stream of incidents in the township that started in June and was first reported by Deputy Road Superintendent Ron Fraser in July.\nFraser said the thieves have gone beyond taking the signs and have started taking the whole pole.\n“It’s ridiculous, and if we catch them, we will prosecute them — I don’t care if it’s a little kid. Somebody’s taking the time to take those signs out,” Pegg said.\nPegg said residents used to complain because all the township’s road department did was ride around the area — but it’s what they were required to do.\n“They have to know when those signs come up missing; we’re responsible for having those signs put in,” Pegg said. “What, $65 for a stop sign? Sixty-five bucks times, I think we’re at four or five — it’s ridiculous.”\nPegg said if the township knows about the missing signs and they aren’t replaced, the township could be held liable.\nPegg said on one road, the township lost the stop signs, the speed signs and the arrow signs at the corner, adding that multiple roads in the township have been hit.\n“It’s cost us quite a bit of money. We need to make sure we’re watching for that,” Pegg said. “(Police Chief) Brian’s (Darbey) got his guys watching for it.”\nNewsletter Today's breaking news and more in your inbox Email (Required) I'm interested in (please check all that apply) (Required) Daily Newsletter Breaking News Obituaries Are you a paying subscriber to the newspaper?
