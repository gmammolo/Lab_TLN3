  "text": "SACRAMENTO – Governor Gavin Newsom announced from Sacramento that California is ramping up its disaster response support to states grappling with severe weather and wildfires, with new emergency deployments headed to New Mexico, Oregon, and Texas. These deployments include highly trained Urban Search and Rescue teams, firefighter strike crews, and emergency coordination staff. The latest round of support includes a focused response to flooding in Ruidoso, New Mexico. According to Governor Newsom’s office, three additional Federal Emergency Management Agency incident support personnel from California are now on the ground helping local officials manage the crisis. “California stands ready to help all Americans in times of crisis. Whether it’s battling wildfires or conducting life-saving search and rescue operations, our state’s highly trained first responders are answering the call to serve communities in need,” said Governor Newsom in a statement issued in Sacramento. Oregon, currently battling intense wildfires, has received substantial support from California. Cal Fire has deployed a strike team of five fire engines, staffed by 19 personnel, along with 28 additional supervisory and incident management personnel. “We stand with Oregon during this critical time, just as they’ve stood with us during some of California’s toughest fire seasons,” said Anale Burlew, Chief Deputy Director of Cal Fire. She added that these mutual aid partnerships are built on “trust, coordination, and a shared commitment to public safety.” In Texas, which is facing ongoing and deadly flooding, California has sent nine federal incident support team members to help with disaster coordination. These individuals bring planning and logistics skills crucial for managing complex emergencies. In addition, 18 local California personnel have been sent as part of a second wave of canine search and recovery teams. Nancy Ward, Director of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, emphasized that mutual aid remains a cornerstone of the state’s approach to emergency response. “California’s emergency management system is built on mutual aid and the spirit of helping our neighbors,” Ward said from Sacramento. “Our highly trained teams stand ready to deploy wherever they’re needed, bringing critical expertise and resources to save lives and support communities in crisis.”",
