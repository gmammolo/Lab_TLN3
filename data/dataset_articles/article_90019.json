  "text": "Two women, a Kenyan professor and a Nigerian researcher, have been awarded the Africa Food Prize for their work in transforming the continent’s food systems. The award, which comes with a $100,000 prize, was announced at the Africa Food Systems Forum (AFSF) in Dakar.\nThe prize committee honored Mary Abukutsa-Onyango and Mercy Diebiru-Ojo for their efforts to promote local crops for dietary diversification and improved nutrition. For three decades, Abukutsa-Onyango, a professor at Jomo Kenyatta University, has focused her research on African leafy vegetables such as amaranth, African nightshade, and jute mallow. Diebiru-Ojo has worked on producing healthy planting materials for cassava and yams, two of Nigeria’s most significant staple crops that help meet daily caloric needs.\n“Professor Abukutsa-Onyango and Dr. Diebiru-Ojo represent the best of African innovation, demonstrating that true transformation lies not only in highlighting major crops but also in valuing the seeds, systems, and knowledge that support our continent's future,” said Jakaya Kikwete, chairman of the Prize Committee and former president of Tanzania.\nWritten in French by Espoir Olodo,\nAdapted in English by Mouka Mezonlin\nOver the past two decades, mobile money has grown into a cornerstone of African finance.
