  "text": "Seoul International Web Fest crowns Yoon Jin-seo Best Actress for 'Two, Once Again'\nSouth Korean actress Yoon Jin-seo is celebrating a win this month. The Alone Together actress just won the Best Actress Award for her film Two, Once Again, at the 11th Seoul International Web Fest. The film was directed by Choi Jong-goo and falls under the genres of thriller and melodrama.\nTwo, Once Again, is a film about two individuals with disabilities who are finding their way in love. Yoon Jin-seo plays the role of a visually-impaired masseuse, while her male counterpart is a patient with a spinal cord injury. Not only has Jin-seo won the Best Actress Award for it, but the film itself has been recognized at the 7th Hanoi International Film Festival in 2024. It won multiple awards in more than 10 different festivals worldwide. These include Best Film, Best Actress, and Critics' Choice\nYoon Jin-seo took to Instagram to announce the wonderful news. She expressed her gratefulness in Korean (here is a rough translation):\n\"I would like to express my infinite gratitude to the director who watched over me and to the staff who supported us through such a challenging set. Thanks to all of you, I thought I wanted to be someone who is a support to others and become even stronger in the next project.\"\nShe continued:\n\"Though there were many difficulties, we gathered our love for 'film' and ultimately created a piece of cinema. 'Two, Once Again' holds a story about people who live small yet hard lives, relying on each other. I hope this film we have made gives strength to someone as well.\"\nHow did Yoon Jin-seo rise to fame?\nYoo Jin-seo, whose birth name is Yoon Soo-kyung, gained popularity after her role in the action-thriller film Old Boy. The actress played the role of Lee Soo-ah, Woo-jin's (Yoo Ji-tae) sister. Her acting earned her the Best New Actress Award at the 40th Baeksang Arts Awards.\nSo far, Yoon Jin has been nominated for three of her films, including The Moonlight of Seoul, The Royal Gambler, and Do You Hear She Sings?\nSo far, the South Korean actress has appeared in more than 20 films and 13 television series. She was the host on Street Sound Take 1 and Trend Report Feel Season 3. She also appeared on Fashion King Korea - Season 2 and Man Who Feeds The Dog Season 3.\nYoon Jin-seo's powerful performance in Two, Once Again has earned her international recognition, adding to her already impressive career. Rising to fame with Old Boy, she continues to grow as one of South Korea's most impressive actresses.",
