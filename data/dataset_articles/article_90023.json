  "text": "Senegal has banned banana imports indefinitely as of September 1, according to a statement posted on the website of the Market Regulation Agency (ARM).\nThe move is the first of its kind for the industry and is part of a strategy to achieve self-sufficiency in banana production by 2029, ARM Director-General Babacar Sembène said. The ban is primarily intended to help local producers sell their harvests on the domestic market, which has faced stiff competition from imported fruit, mainly from Côte d’Ivoire.\nLocal observers note that Senegalese bananas are often overlooked in the market because of their smaller size, shorter shelf life, and less appealing taste, as well as their seasonal availability, which stands in contrast to Ivorian imports.\nThe import freeze comes as local production has surged over the past decade. Senegal’s banana harvest has nearly tripled since 2018, when it was only 34,500 tons. According to the ARM, production is projected to reach 112,500 tons by the end of the 2025 season.\n\"On average, daily demand is 300 tons,\" Sembène was quoted as saying by local newspaper Le Soleil. \"With the monitoring system we have in place, we believe we can meet the market's needs.\"\nWritten in French by Stéphanas Assocle,\nAdapted in English by Mouka Mezonlin\nOver the past two decades, mobile money has grown into a cornerstone of African finance.
