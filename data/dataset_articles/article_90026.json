  "text": "Niall O’Keeffe: Irish solidarity is helping to save the lives of Palestinians\nOn a sobering visit to the West Bank, I saw the scale of human suffering faced by those in Gaza\nPinned to a notice board in the Palestine Red Crescent Society headquarters in Ramallah, the West Bank, are photographs of 48 Red Crescent workers, killed in the line of duty over the last two years in Gaza. These were dads, husbands, brothers, uncles – people who lost their lives while trying to save others.\nJust a few feet from those photographs, Rasha is showing me the online ambulance-tracking system that is used to follow progress of their 21 ambulances still operating in Gaza, down from 55 due to fuel shortages and supply blockages.\nJoin the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel\nStay up to date with all the latest news",
