  "text": "Like every year, in 2025, the Internet found its new obsession, and it was the creepy but cute Labubu dolls. With pointed ears, jagged teeth and a mischievous grin. These fuzzy little toyas have become the latest pop culture phenomenon. People all over the world are seen flaunting them as keychains, bag charms and collectables. But just when it seemed like nothing could steal the spotlight from Labubus, a new contender entered the scene. And it’s not a doll at all. A video has been making the rounds on social media, offering people an adorable alternative to the creepy Labubus. And what is that? An adorable, real puppy. The short clip shared on Instagram showed a man carrying his dog inside a large jute bag, which Indians usually use to carry their groceries. Instead of being restless, the little dog calmly sat inside the bag as the man carried it around a building. Internet Chooses Between “Gucci Bags With Labubu\" And A Bag With A Real Puppy “Gucci tote bag with Labubu??? Or Thi ,\" followed by a red heart and face with heart eyes emojis, was written atop the clip. In the caption, the user who posted the clip wrote, “Cute lil love.\" People who came across this adorable clip of the puppy knew what they wanted. Obviously, the choice was the puppy inside the bag over any Labubus in the world. Taking to the comments section of the clip, which has been viewed over 134,000 times since it was posted, one user wrote, “This bag without even a moment’s thought.\" Another mentioned, “Ye tou swaal hi nahi hua, ye bas ye hi.\" “This because it’s priceless & precious,\" said a different user who couldn’t just get over the cuteness of the clip. “Nothing can beat this … No Gucci Prada or Hermes can beat this,\" some other individual wrote. Another person joked, “Desi jhola aur desi pup- always!!!\" What’s The Craze For Labubus? Labubu is part of a group called “The Monsters\", which includes other quirky creatures like Zimomo, Mokoko and Tycoco. The doll’s design is inspired by Nordic mythology and was created by Kasing Lung, a Hong Kong-born artist. The character first appeared in Lung’s children’s book series. In 2019, Pop Mart, a popular toy company, started making Labubu dolls as collectables. Since then, it has gained popularity with the release of new versions on a regular basis. Labubu started as a collectable toy, but now it is a fashion accessory. One reason for its popularity is the “blind box\" format, where buyers don’t know which version they will get until they open the box. This surprise element makes the quest of collecting them fun and exciting. Another reason for their popularity is the presence of celebrities, who often use Labubus as their bag charms or keychains.",
