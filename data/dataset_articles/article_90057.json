  "text": "Bhubaneswar: A state-wide awareness campaign titled “Jeevan Zindabad” will be launched across all 30 districts of Odisha from September 10, coinciding with World Suicide Prevention Day, to curb suicidal tendencies among youth.\nThe initiative, spearheaded by Naman Foundation in collaboration with Odisha Police and the Sports and Youth Services department, will feature over 70 artists, singers, comedians, and motivational performers sharing real-life stories of resilience and success.\nThe decision was taken Wednesday at a high-level meeting chaired by Higher Education Minister Suryabansi Suraj at Lok Seva Bhavan.\nThe meeting was attended by Chief Secretary Manoj Ahuja, DGP YB Khurania, actor Sabyasachi Mishra, music director Premanand, and other senior officials. Minister Suraj said the campaign would be a joint initiative involving multiple departments, including Higher Education, Women & Child Development, and Home. Chief Secretary Manoj Ahuja underscored the role of district administrations in the campaign and suggested organising speech and essay competitions in schools and colleges to spread awareness. Actor Sabyasachi Mishra added, “When we think of suicide, we think of youth. This programme aims to instil hope and positivity.” The campaign comes in the wake of the August 11 suicide of a Balasore college student, which led to a pilot event in Bhubaneswar.\nFollowing its success, Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi recommended expanding the initiative across the state. Each event will run for three hours in the largest district auditoriums, accompanied by an awareness walk with participation from students, volunteers, NCC, Scouts, and Guides. The campaign will begin September 10 at the Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology Auditorium, Bhubaneswar, and conclude in Cuttack with an award ceremony.\nSuggest A Correction;)",
