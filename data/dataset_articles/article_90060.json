  "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — Around 250 Indiana farmers and ag professionals attended the first Critical Issues Summit hosted by Indiana Farm Bureau.\nAttendees heard about the future of farming, technology and geopolitical relationships from keynote speaker Brett Sciotto, founder and CEO of Idealyst Innovation.\nA panel on trade, taxes and local government was held in the afternoon.\n“The Critical Issues Summit was full of meaningful discussion around the future of farming and the challenges facing agriculture today,” said Randy Kron, INFB president.\n“Farmers are resilient. We adapt, we innovate, we figure things out and we know we accomplish more when we work together. That’s why it was so important for us to provide this new program so our members could have a seat at the table in these ever-evolving discussions that impact their livelihood.”\nSpecial appearances and comments were also made by Indiana Secretary of Management and Budget Lisa Hershman, Indiana State Department of Agriculture Director Don Lamb and Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith.\n“There is no shortage of challenges for our farmers and rural communities,” Kron said. “But the optimism our members heard from national trade experts, state legislators and local officials today about the opportunities we have for growth really left us feeling positive about some really tough conversations.”",
