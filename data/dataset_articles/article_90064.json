  "text": "Not just small cars, but big cars also cheaper under GST 2.0\nEarlier, buyers of big petrol and diesel cars paid an effective tax of nearly 50%, comprising 28% GST plus a hefty 22% compensation cess. Under the new system, this has been rationalised to a flat 40% GST.\nThe government’s sweeping GST 2.0 overhaul has brought relief not only for small car buyers but also for those eyeing bigger vehicles. For the first time since GST was introduced in 2017, the tax burden on premium cars has been reduced, thanks to the removal of the additional cess.\nEarlier, buyers of big petrol and diesel cars paid an effective tax of nearly 50%, comprising 28% GST plus a hefty 22% compensation cess. Under the new system, this has been rationalised to a flat 40% GST.\nImportantly, once an item enters the 40% slab, no additional cess or surcharge can be imposed, bringing much-needed clarity for automakers and consumers.\nThis shift marks a dramatic change for the automobile sector, where high taxes on larger vehicles had kept demand in check.\nAnalysts expect carmakers to recalibrate pricing in the coming weeks, making premium sedans and SUVs more accessible.\nThe reform is part of a wider simplification of GST into just four slabs — 0%, 5%, 18% and 40% — scrapping the earlier 12% and 28% rates. Smaller vehicles, including motorcycles under 350cc, entry-level cars, three-wheelers, as well as buses and trucks, have all moved down to the 18% slab, making them significantly cheaper.\nWith both ends of the automobile market — from budget bikes to luxury SUVs — benefiting from GST 2.0, industry watchers believe the sector could see a broad-based revival in demand, especially ahead of the festive season.",
