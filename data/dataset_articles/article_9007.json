  "text": "Bay Area crews arrived in Texas on Wednesday to help in the search for missing people after a catastrophic flood impacted the state.\nCrews from Oakland, Menlo Park and Mountain View made the journey to lend a helping hand. The Menlo Park Fire District team also included two dogs trained to detect human remains and their handlers.\n“The K-9 handlers specifically are in charge of HRD dogs, which are human remains discovery dogs,” said Harold Schapelhouman, a retired fire chief of the Menlo Park Fire District.\nAt least 120 people, including 36 children, are confirmed dead across six counties in Texas as of Wednesday.\nLarry Mynar, a disaster specialist, said teams have seen the unthinkable in the flood zone as cadaver dogs lead those on horseback to remove river areas.\n“We’ll stay until we get it done and we want them to have closure,” Mynar said.\nSchapelhouman, who’s also a founder of the National Urban Search and Rescue Program, said the goal is to bring people back to their families.\n“We go in there with big hearts and compassion, and we hope we find people if we’re at the stage where there are still people who are missing and thought to be alive and if that’s no longer the case, hopefully we bring people back to their families and allow those people some level of closure,” he said.\nUnits with Riverside, Los Angeles and Orange counties were also deployed to Texas.\n“It requires special resources and people who have the right attitude, stamina and resilience, and compassion to do this type of work,” Schapelhouman",
