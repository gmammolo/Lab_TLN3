  "text": "Daily Evergreen\nwebsite\nWhitman County, Washington\nSummer ends with happy tails at the Whitman County Humane Society’s annual event\nBy Eleanor Colgan,\n1 days agoThe Whitman County Humane Society held its Barkinglot event Saturday, celebrating the end of summer with high adoption rates and community involvement. In the cat building of the WCHS, navigating the narrow aisle between the cat kennels was nearly impossible due to prospective cat parents. Staff members, volunteers and animal lovers had to navigate past people half-inside kennels and crates, coercing the cats and kittens from their beds to cozy up to prospective owners.",
