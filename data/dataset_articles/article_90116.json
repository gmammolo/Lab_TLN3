For context, always refer to the full article.\nMANILA, Philippines – Is Pope Leo XIV ditching his open-air popemobile for a BMW motorcycle?\nNo, it’s a motorcycle set to be auctioned at Sotheby’s in Munich to help fund a school in Madagascar, according to Vatican News, citing Missio Austria.\nThe proceeds of the auction will be coursed through the Pontifical Mission Societies of Austria, and will help educate Madagascar children who are forced to work in mines.\nLeo, 69, signed the BMW motorcycle during his weekly general audience on Wednesday, September 3. A tennis enthusiast who is known to gamely pose for photographs with visitors, even briefly sat on the motorcycle to the crowd’s delight.\nThis is not the first time a pope signed a motorbike for charitable cause.\nIn 2019, a Harley-Davidson motorbike, which was signed by the late Pope Francis, was sold at a Stafford auction for £42,000 (P3.23 million). Proceeds had been dedicated “to build an orphanage and a school in Uganda and to provide shelter for abandoned and deprived children,” the BBC reported.\nIn 2014, another Harley-Davidson motorbike, signed by Francis, was sold at a Paris auction for £174,000 (P13.37 million) to help homeless people in Rome. – Rappler.com\nHow does this make you feel?",
