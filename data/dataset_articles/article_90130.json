  "text": "Actor Ganindra Bimo was seen helping one of the students suspected of being a victim of police violence that occurred in the city of Bandung some time ago.\nThis good action was shared by a netizen named Nisa who has an @afffifasp account. Nisa was seen sharing a short message from Ganindra Bimo who offered to help her sister who was a victim of police violence.\n\"Hello Nisa. Greetings to you. I am Ganindra Bimo. My condolences for the incident that happened to your sister. May I help with the cost of treatment ??\" Ganindra wrote in a DM message distributed by Nisa.\nResponding to this, Nisa admitted that she was very grateful for the assistance and attention given by Ganindra Bimo, as well as other netizens who had already disseminated the story about her sister.\n\"Thank you as much as possible for Sis @ganindrabimo who has helped take care of my sister. I also thank all my friends who have helped in spreading and praying for the best for my sister's condition,\" wrote Nisa.\nFurthermore, Nisa tried to share related to the current condition of her sister who suffered serious injuries in the area of her head, face, and hands as a result of the officers' beatings.\n\"My sister's condition now has sewing wounds above her left eye and left elbow, there is also bleeding in the back of the head,\" he explained.\nUntil now, Nisa added, if the doctor is still monitoring the victim's condition and it is possible that an MRI examination will be carried out due to the pain his younger brother is still feeling.\nFor this incident, Nisa said that she had reported this case to the local police. He plans to report the officers who have battered his younger brother on purpose.\n\"Previously I also wanted to inform you that I have reported to the Resort Police to investigate my sister's case,\" said Nisa again.\nPreviously, Nisa told the chronology of her sister who was suspected of being the victim of the wrong target while including a picture of her sister's wound all over her body.\n\"My sister was hit by the police's 'wrong target'. She didn't join the demonstration, just after celebrating her friend's birthday, then went home, but the mistake was through Gedung Sate at around 04.47 am,\" wrote Nisa recently.\n\"His head was stepped on until his temple was sewn, continued to be dragged, thrown into my place, fortunately he managed to escape. After that, he was beaten in the back with a hose or iron,\" said Nisa.\nIt is known that the riots in Bandung occurred after a large demonstration demanding the cancellation of the DPR RI allowance and urging the ratification of the Asset Confiscation Bill.\nThe action, which initially took place in front of the West Java DPRD Building, ended in chaos and spread to a number of points, including the Gedung Sate area and surrounding campuses.\nThe English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French versions are automatically generated by the AI.
