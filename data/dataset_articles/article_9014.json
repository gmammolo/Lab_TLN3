  "text": "KERR COUNTY, Tex. – Missouri Task Force 1 (MO-TF1) has arrived in Texas to begin a 14-day mission to assist local authorities with search efforts following the deadly floods that have claimed more than 100 lives there. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed the task force to hard-hit Kerr County, Texas, to the heart of the devastation caused by this latest natural disaster. The 50-member crew includes first responders representing multiple departments across the St. Louis area, including the Florissant Valley Fire Protection District. The crew had just hours to pack their things and hit the road Monday after FEMA made the call. Missouri’s Task Force 1 is a division of the Boone County Fire Protection District. The task force’s spokesman tells FOX 2 the conditions in Texas are similar to what the task force faced last year while aiding crews in parts of North Carolina devastated by Hurricane Helene. The task force is one of 28 nationwide and has been in operation since 1998. For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to FOX 2.",
