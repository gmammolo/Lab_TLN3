  "text": "Gladyce Ammann\nObituaries\nSeptember 3, 2025\n[Mundwiler Funeral Home] 0\nGladyce Ammann went to celebrate her 106th birthday with her Lord on August 29, 2025.\nFuneral services will be held on Friday, September 5, 2025, at 2:00 p.m. at Zion Community Church in Wilmot, SD. Visitation will be held on Thursday, September 4, 2025, from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. at Zion Community Church with a prayer service beginning at 7:00 p.m. Visitation will continue one hour prior to the service at the church on Friday. Rev. Dr. DeVern Schwenn will officiate the service and interment will be at Wilmot Cemetery.\nGladyce Irene (Johnson) Ammann was born on August 30, 1919, in Wist, SD, to John E. and Helga (Stenseng) Johnson. She was raised in Lake Township of Roberts County, where she cultivated the strong values and resilience that would define her life. Gladyce attended school in Wilmot and graduated from Wilmot High School.\nBefore Gladyce started dating Harold Ammann, she and some friends were leaving a store as Harold and his brothers were entering. She thought Harold was the “cutest”. The two were united in marriage on June 15, 1939. They were blessed with three children: Ardelle, Allyn, and Linda.\nGladyce and Harold purchased the family farm and the two worked hand-in-hand. They raised various animals including cattle, purebred Hampshire pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, Banties, Guinea hens, and sheep. Gladyce’s ability to deftly manage the complexities of farm life was matched only by the joy she found in every task she undertook.\nKnown for her culinary talents, she was a wonderful cook whose delicious meals brought family and friends together. Her kitchen was often filled with the melodies of her singing as she prepared her famous dishes, reflecting the joy she found in nurturing those she loved. As a skillful baker, Gladyce was renowned for creating charming birthday cakes, each baked with love to celebrate her family’s special moments.\nWith a green thumb and a passion for gardening, Gladyce maintained a large garden from which she canned fruits and vegetables. Her love for flowers was evident in the vibrant flower beds she tended to with care, adding beauty to her surroundings and joy to her heart. She was also an avid seamstress, crafting numerous garments and outfits with skill and precision.\nEmbodying the grit and tenacity of her Norwegian heritage, Gladyce persevered through so many things in her life. After Harold passed away in 1996, she remained on the farm until purchasing her home in Wilmot. She did so many things and she always did them well and with a happy heart.\nLeft to cherish Gladyce’s memory are her children: Ardelle Christensen of Owatonna, MN; Allyn Ammann of Wilmot, SD; and Linda (Woody) DeClercq of Milbank, SD; eight grandchildren: 14 great-grandchildren; four great-great-grandchildren; sisters-in-law: Caroline Ammann, and Beverly Schultz; along with many nieces, nephews, and friends.\nPreceding her in death were her husband, Harold; her parents; brothers: Alvin Johnson, Gordon Johnson, and Murrel Johnson; sisters: Delores Gerdes; and Gloria Earl Hansen; and son-in-law, Gordon Christensen.",
