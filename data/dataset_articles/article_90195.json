Amid global shifts, trade realignments, and climate uncertainties, Indian farmers—through FPOs and MSMEs—are poised to be solution providers to the world. This decade is about making FPOs enterprise-ready, investable, and globally connected, moving from conversations to commitments and from partnerships to impactful projects.”",
