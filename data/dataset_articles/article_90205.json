  "text": "The Powerball jackpot has leaped to $1.7 billion after there were no big grand prize winners in Wednesday’s drawing.\nWednesday’s winning numbers were 3, 16, 29, 61, 69 with a red Powerball of 22 and a PowerPlay multiplier of 2. That resulted in four $2 million winners across Michigan, Oregon, Texas and Wyoming and 11 $1 million winners from Florida, California (2), Colorado, Georgia (two), Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\nThe $1.7 billion jackpot is for an annuity option, paid over 30 years. Winners almost always opt for the lump-sum cash prize, which for Powerball would be $770.3 million cash.\nThe prize is subject to taxes , which includes an automatic withholding tax of 24% levied against the winnings, and another 13% in federal taxes when you file your 2025 return.\nThere are also state taxes in some jurisdictions, which range from 2.9% to 10.9% depending on the state you live in. But if you’re lucky enough to live in California, Florida, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington or Wyoming, you won’t pay taxes on your winnings.\nThe next Powerball drawing is on Saturday, Sep. 6, 2025.\nNo one has won Powerball’s jackpot since May 31, 2025, a stretch of 42 consecutive drawings without anyone matching the game’s six numbers. Before that, the jackpot was hit 11 times, however, the winnings were all under $600 million.\nWednesday’s $1.4 billion jackpot is now one of the 10 biggest in U.S. history, including Mega Millions.\nThe largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history stands at $2.04 billion and was won by a single Powerball ticket in California on Nov. 7, 2022. The winner, Edwin Castro, came forward in early 2023 after months of speculation.\nThe reason for the jackpot drought is simple: The odds of winning the top prize are miserable, at 1 in 292.2 million. It’s those odds that create the large jackpots that are designed to attract attention and drive up sales.\nPowerball is played in 45 states plus Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Drawings are held at 10:59 p.m. ET at the Florida Lottery studio in Tallahassee.",
