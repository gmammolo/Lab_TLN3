  "text": "iD Fresh opens 1st batter shop in Vizag\nimage for illustrative purpose\nVisakhapatnam: iDFresh Food, fresh food brand, has launched its first-ever batter shop in Visakhapatnam. The strategic initiative is aimed at catering to Tier 2 and 3 markets, offering consumers fresh and hygienic batter.\nFor years, Vizag’s bustling local batter market has been dominated by unbranded, makeshift shops, and pushcarts selling batter twice a day. While widely popular, much of this batter is inconsistent in quality, contains soda or preservatives, and is prepared in conditions that fall short of hygiene standards.\n“Vizag has a thriving breakfast culture, but we saw a gap between consumer expectations for quality and what’s available in the unbranded market,” said Rajat Diwakar, CEO India at iD Fresh Food.\n“Our batter shop is designed to build trust, spark curiosity, and offer a healthier, tastier alternative—while staying true to our commitment of delivering fresh, natural food without preservatives,\" he stated.",
