  "text": "By Kim Grizzard ,\n12 hours ago\nPitt County Schools showed improvement in the 2024-25 school year, with a higher graduation rate and nearly 90% of schools meeting or exceeding expectations for academic growth, according to state test results released today.\nTwo-thirds of schools in the district had grades of C or better on school performance indicators presented in a report to the state Board of Education. Of three dozen schools receiving grades, two schools scored an A, six received a B and 16 a C. Twelve schools received a grade of D. For the second consecutive year, no schools in the district received a grade of F.\n\"These results are a clear reflection and testament of the hard work, focus and direction of our students, educators, families and communities,\" Superintendent Dr. Steve M. Lassiter Jr. said in a statement.\nSix schools in the district — A.G. Cox, Belvoir, G.R. Whitfield, Lakeforest, Northwest and Ridgewood— improved a letter grade over the previous year. Three schools schools, J.H. Rose, South Central and Sugg-Bundy, scored a letter grade lower.\nFor the last decade, public schools in North Carolina have received report cards containing grades of A-F that are based mainly on student performance on end-of-grade testing in grades three through eight or end-of-course testing in high school. State law requires that standardized test scores account for 80% of a school’s performance grade, while the remaining 20% is based on students’ academic growth. The final grade is based on a 15-point scale.\nThirty-two of the three dozen PCS schools included in the state report met or exceeded expected academic growth. Fifteen — Ayden Elementary, Belvoir, Bethel, Farmville Middle, G.R. Whitfield, Hope, Lakeforest, North Pitt, Northwest, South Central, South Greenville, Wahl-Coates, Wellcome, Wintergreen and Innovation Early College High School — surpassed growth expectations.\nIn addition to statewide accountability tests, there are other indicators for high school performance grades, including graduation rate. Pitt County Schools showed a high school graduation rate of 85.5%, up from 83.9% last year and the highest level since 2017. This compares with a state high school graduation rate of 87.7%.\nThe number of schools designated as low-performing declined from 10 in 2023-24 to seven in 2024-25. They include: Ayden Middle, C.M. Eppes, Falkland, E.B. Aycock, Grifton, Pactolus and Sugg-Bundy. Under the school accountability model, schools that receive a D or F performance grade and do not exceed growth are identified as low-performing.\nTwelve schools in the district are considered continually low-performing schools because they received the designation two out of the last three years. Of those, five — Belvoir, Bethel, Farmville Middle, South Greenville and Wahl-Coates — were not designated as low-performing this year.\nSchools receiving an A performance grade are: Innovation Early College High School and PCS Early College High School.\nSchools receiving a B performance grade are: Chicod School, D.H. Conley High School, Hope Middle School, Ridgewood Elementary School, G.R. Whitfield School and Wintergreen Primary/Intermediate School.\nSchools receiving a C performance grade are: Ayden-Grifton High School, Ayden Elementary School, Belvoir Elementary School, Creekside Elementary School, A.G. Cox Middle School, Eastern Elementary School, Elmhurst Elementary School, Farmville Central High School, Lakeforest Elementary School, North Pitt High School, Northwest Elementary School, Pitt County Virtual School, W.H. Robinson Elementary School, J.H. Rose High School, South Central High School and Stokes School.\nSchools receiving a D performance grade are: E.B. Aycock Middle School, Ayden Middle School, Bethel School, Sam D. Bundy/H.B. Sugg Elementary School, C.M. Eppes Middle School, Falkland Elementary School, Farmville Middle School, Grifton School, Pactolus School, South Greenville Elementary, Wahl-Coates Elementary School and Wellcome Middle School.",
