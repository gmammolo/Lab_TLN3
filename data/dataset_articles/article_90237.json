  "text": "UK ambassador discusses tourism with Kefalogianni\nBritish Ambassador to Greece Matthew Lodge, and Consul Alexandra Gregory visited Tourism Minister Olga Kefalogianni to assess tourism relations between the two countries.\nKefalogianni emphasized that the positive results reflect the strategy pursued by the ministry, confirming the trend toward extending the tourist season, as well as the increase in incoming tourist traffic and revenue, which is also evident in tourist arrivals from Britain to Greece.\nLodge noted that there has been an impressive increase in tourists from Britain, exceeding 5 million in 2024. He also stressed that tourism, along with shipping and education, is a key pillar of Greek-British relations.\nBritain’s ambassador said Greece and Great Britain must focus on the implementation of the new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS).\nHe further stressed the need for the development of healthcare infrastructure and the optimal management of water resources in smaller tourism destinations, and spoke about to road safety issues.",
