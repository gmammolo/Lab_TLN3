  "text": "By Alix Martichoux ,\n8 hours ago\n(NEXSTAR) – The results of Wednesday night’s Powerball drawing have been highly anticipated, and we won’t make you wait any longer.\nThe winning numbers are with a Powerball number of 3, 16, 29, 61, and 69, with a Powerball of 22. The Power Play multiplier is 2X.\nIf those numbers match your ticket, you’re a winner of one of the largest lottery jackpots in U.S. history . The jackpot reached an estimated $1.4 billion ahead of the drawing on Wednesday, with officials increasing that to $1.444 billion just before pulling the above numbers.\nCash vs. annuity: Which payout should you take if you win the Powerball jackpot? How much you actually get to take home depends on a number of factors. First off, if there are multiple people who match the winning numbers, the grand prize will be split among them. That actually happened in 2016 when a $1.586 billion Powerball jackpot had to be split among three winning tickets: one in California, one in Tennessee and one in Florida.\nThe next big factor is whether you choose to receive the winnings in one lump-sum payout or over 30 installments. If you choose the former, the estimated cash payout is an estimated $634.3 million this time around.\nFinally, you’ll have to fork over at least some of your prize in taxes. Everyone has to fork over a big chunk to Uncle Sam in federal taxes, and most people also have to pay state taxes on their winnings. Only residents of California, Delaware, Florida, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming are lucky – they don’t have to pay state taxes on lottery prizes.\nWhy winner of $1.4 billion Powerball jackpot won’t be an instant billionaire It probably goes without saying that you have to be very, very lucky to win the Powerball jackpot. Just how lucky? The odds are 1 in 292.2 million.\nIt won’t be known for at least a couple of hours whether there was a winning ticket (or tickets) in this drawing. If you’ve already received the heartbreaking news that your ticket isn’t a jackpot winner, don’t worry — your ticket could still be a winner . You have a 1 in 24.87 chance of winning any prize while playing Powerball.\nAddy Bink contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
