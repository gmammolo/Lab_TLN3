  "text": "Aviv Ovardya, Manon Revel, and Amy X. Zhang, alongside several coauthors, provide a map of what meaningful democratic AI governance and alignment look like. They introduce the \"Democracy Levels Framework,\" which introduces five increasingly democratic levels at which democratic governance can be implemented.\nThe authors' paper, which draws upon examples including Anthropic's Collective Constitutional AI and Meta's Oversight Board, can be downloaded from arXiv.",
