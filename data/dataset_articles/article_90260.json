  "text": "By Quentin Shores ,\n3 hours ago GREAT FALLS — Dozens of dogs and cats rescued from a recent animal cruelty case in Cascade County are continuing their road to recovery at the Maclean-Cameron Adoption Center. The seizure of the pets was done by the Cascade County Sheriff's Office, which is helping to raise money to help with the medical care and rehabilitation of the dogs and cats.\nSeveral years ago, the Sheriff's Office created the Sheriff's Legacy Foundation ( website ) to raise money that directly supports equipment, training, and other essentials not covered in the annual budget allotted to the Cascade County Sheriff's Office.\nQuentin Shores reports - watch:\nWhat is the Sheriff's Legacy Foundation?
