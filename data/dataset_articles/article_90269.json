  "text": "UNIVERSITY PARK — Conservation volunteers, educators, green industry professionals, master gardeners or anyone interested in learning about invasive species and strategies to combat their spread can attend free webinars hosted by Penn State Extension.\n“Pennsylvania Invasive Species” is an ongoing webinar series with four events for this year. The webinars, scheduled from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m., will include the following:\n— “Honey Bees,” Sept. 5. Invasive species have both positive and negative impacts on honey bees. Established pests such as varroa mites and small hive beetles cause harm, while invasive plants such as honeysuckle and Japanese knotweed are excellent sources of nectar. Participants will review various cases of the impacts of invasive species on honey bees and will discuss species that are spreading but not yet present in Pennsylvania or the United States. Register here.\n— “Choose Native,” Oct. 3. The Choose Native project is a collaboration among the Great Lakes Commission, Pennsylvania Sea Grant and Penn State Extension. The primary focus of the project is preventing invasive species introductions through the organisms in the trade pathway, mainly targeting the landscaping and water gardening industry. Presenters will highlight results from statewide industry surveys during this session and discuss the new Pennsylvania Choose Native publication for landscapers, water gardeners and homeowners. Register here.\n— “Bed Bugs,” Nov. 7. In this webinar, participants will learn how to identify bed bugs at various stages of life, gain insights into their biology and behavior, and discover effective management strategies to address infestations. Homeowners, property managers and pest control professionals can use science-based knowledge to help stay ahead of the problem. Register here.\n— “Jumping Worms,” Dec. 5. Jumping worms (Amynthas spp.) are an emerging invasive threat, dramatically altering soil structure and impacting plant health. This webinar will examine their introduction to North America, their current distribution in Pennsylvania and the ecological consequences of their spread. Participants will learn how to identify jumping worms by their distinguishing features and to understand how they differ from other earthworms. The session also will cover management strategies to help prevent their spread and mitigate their impact on gardens, forests and landscapes. Register here.\nPenn State Extension offers these events at no charge, but registration is required to receive the link to access each webinar. A link to the recorded webinar will be emailed to registrants within 10 business days after the live event. The recording will be accessible for six months from the event date.\nMore information is available on the Penn State Extension website.",
