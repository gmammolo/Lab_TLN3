  "text": "The Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) has been projected as the winner of Wednesday’s general election, though the victory came by a slim margin in what many observers say is the closest contest in years. Preliminary results showed the party leading in 33 of 63 seats.\nThis marks the first time the JLP has won a third consecutive term, making Prime Minister Andrew Holness the first leader of the party to secure three back-to-back wins at the polls. The only other prime minister to do so was PJ Patterson of the People’s National Party.\nIn previous years, many did not see the PNP as a strong opposition force. But that perception began to shift after the 2024 local government elections. Although the PNP narrowly lost by a razor-thin margin—a result that surprised many JLP members and supporters—it signaled growing momentum. The near-win boosted confidence within the party and among voters calling for change, positioning the PNP as a credible challenger in this year’s general election.\nThat momentum was visible throughout the campaign. From heated debates over corruption and citizenship questions to arguments about leadership, integrity, and the state of the Jamaican economy, the election season ignited spirited discussions not only at home but also in the diaspora. Across social media platforms, Jamaicans abroad weighed in on campaign promises and scandals, underscoring how deeply this election resonated with the wider community.\nVoter turnout this year was 38.8%, roughly the same as the COVID-affected 2020 election (37.85%), and still well below the 48% turnout in 2016. Analysts said the figures were a worrying sign of persistent voter apathy, despite the high stakes and intense public interest in the election, with many Jamaicans still lining up at polling stations throughout the day to make their voices heard.\nSeveral high-profile JLP candidates retained their seats, including Robert Montague, Floyd Green, Rhoda Moy Crawford, Matthew Samuda, Daryl Vaz, and Horace Chang. Dr. Christopher Tufton, the health minister who guided Jamaica through the COVID-19 pandemic, held onto West Central St. Catherine with 6,940 votes against the PNP’s Locksley Francis, who polled 3,718. Prime Minister Andrew Holness was also projected to retain his St. Andrew West Central seat.\nBut there were also major setbacks. Ann-Marie “Action Ann” Vaz, who had been considered one of the JLP’s rising stars, lost Portland Eastern to newcomer Isat Buchanan of the PNP by fewer than 200 votes, underscoring how competitive even high-profile seats became in this election.\nOn the PNP side, Opposition Leader Mark Golding cruised to a landslide in Southern St. Andrew, where he polled 9,371 votes against the JLP’s Carlton Allen’s 1,183. Golding, who first entered Parliament in 2017, has steadily consolidated his leadership within the party, and Wednesday’s victory reinforced his growing stature as a national leader.\nLong-standing MPs also held their ground. Anthony Hylton, who has represented Western St. Andrew since 1993, won with 8,115 votes over the JLP’s Corey Dunkley’s 4,443. Phillip Paulwell, a fixture in Kingston East and Port Royal since 1997, retained his seat with 6,255 votes against JLP challenger Courtney Burnett’s 1,472.\nFitz Jackson, who has represented South St. Catherine since 1994, also emerged victorious, defeating Delroy Dobney with 9,025 votes to 5,970. In East St. Andrew, JLP’s Fayval Williams secured a third term, edging Patricia Duncan-Sutherland by 438 votes. The PNP’s Peter Bunting took Southern Manchester by 670 votes, while Julian Robinson extended his hold on South East St. Andrew with 5,418 votes against the JLP’s Kevin Frith’s 3,137.\nDespite the PNP’s strong showing, preliminary counts give the overall edge to the JLP, allowing the party to claim a narrow victory.\nFor many Jamaicans, this election felt less like routine politics and more like a referendum on the direction of the country. Years of debate over governance, accountability, and economic inequality appear to have fueled frustration, even as the JLP touted achievements in growth and development.\nMeanwhile, the PNP’s resurgence has reinvigorated Jamaica’s two-party system, restoring competitiveness that some had believed was waning. With Golding consolidating power at home and energizing supporters abroad, the PNP now looks poised to mount a stronger challenge in future elections, regardless of this year’s final outcome.\nAs Jamaica and the diaspora await the official count, one thing is clear: the 2025 general election has already changed the course of the nation’s political landscape.",
