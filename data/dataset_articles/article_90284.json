  "text": "Global Adoption of RDK Surpasses 200 Million Devices Across Leading Broadband and Video Service Providers\nGlobal Adoption of RDK Surpasses 200 Million Devices Across Leading Broadband and Video Service Providers\nPR Newswire\nPHILADELPHIA, Sept. 4, 2025\n- Operators across Europe, Asia, North America, and Latin America have deployed RDK as their open-source software platform of choice\n- RDK community expands to more than 700 CPE manufacturers, SoC vendors, software developers, system integrators, and service providers\n- RDK7 launched to ease third party integration and increase efficiency for video service providers\nPHILADELPHIA, Sept. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Ahead of IBC2025 and the 2025 RDK Global Summit, RDK Management (RDK)) announced that RDK open-source software, used to power customer-premises equipment (CPE) from broadband and video service providers, has been shipped on more than 200 million devices globally to date.\nRDK open-source software standardizes many of the core functions used in broadband and video devices. By standardizing these core functions, service providers can develop and deploy a consistent set of applications and services across geographies, hardware, SoC suppliers, and video and broadband access networks (GPON, DOCSIS, DSL, and fixed wireless). RDK enables service providers to manage their devices; control their own UI/UX and app experiences; and harmonize device telemetry and analytics to improve the customer experience and business results.\n\"Crossing more than 200 million shipped devices clearly demonstrates that RDK is the open-source platform of choice for many leading broadband and video service providers globally,\" said Jason Briggs, President and General Manager of RDK. \"Beyond RDK's scale, we continue to roll-out new advancements, such as RDK7, to simplify software integrations and increase efficiency for service providers and their partners. Our community of more than 700 CPE manufacturers, SoC vendors, software developers, system integrators, and service providers continues to be our source of strength and continuous innovation.\"\nThere are now more than 700 technology companies within the RDK community that span leading silicon companies, CE manufacturers, software developers, system integrators, and service providers. Service providers with publicly announced RDK deployments include: Atlantic Broadband, BCN, Claro, Comcast, Charter, Cox, Deutsche Telekom, Fetch, Foxtel, J:COM, KabelPlus, Liberty Global, Mediacom, Megacable, Multichoice, Melita, NOS, Nuuday, Orange, Rogers, SFR (part of Altice Europe), Shaw, Sky, Stofa, Telcom Argentina, Toya, Vectra, Vidéotron, Vodafone, VOO, VTR, WOW, Xumo, Ziggo, and others.\nRDK Technology\nFor entertainment, RDK Management recently introduced RDK7 — the next evolution of open-source software for video and streaming devices — designed to help operators launch new services faster and extend the life of their devices. Its modular architecture streamlines essential functions like audio/video playback, conditional access, DRM, networking, captions, emergency alerts, voice control, telemetry, and more across a wide range of hardware. By separating hardware, middleware, and app layers, RDK7 allows teams to work in parallel, accelerating time-to-market for services from streaming video to gaming. A redesigned hardware porting kit makes it simpler to bring RDK to chipsets or devices, while the modular approach speeds up fixes and feature rollouts. By combining enhanced performance with a layered development approach, RDK7 aims to reduce integration costs, extend hardware lifecycles and maximize long-term value.\nFor connectivity, RDK-B standardizes core enabling functions including device management, telemetry, Wi-Fi services, Ethernet access, IPv6 transitioning, and more, which work across all major network access technologies including DOCSIS, GPON, DSL, and Fixed Wireless Access (FWA). By packaging and open sourcing these in a single standard software stack, service providers can develop, deploy, and manage a consistent set of broadband services across silicon and device manufacturers for use across their networks and geographic footprints.\nRDK is available at no cost to companies who want to access code, collaborate, develop, and submit contributions back to the RDK community. For organizations that want to engage further, RDK offers a tiered membership program that provides enhanced collaboration, strategic engagement, training, and technical support. Additional information about RDK is available at www.rdkcentral.com.\nAbout RDK Management\nRDK Management is an open-source consortium that manages RDK for the global community. RDK is an open-source software platform that standardizes core functions used in broadband, video, and IoT devices. RDK enables service providers to control their device diagnostics data, business models, and apps to improve the customer experience and drive business results. The RDK community is comprised of more than 700 companies including CPE manufacturers, SoC vendors, software developers, system integrators, and service providers.
