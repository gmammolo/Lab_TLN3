  "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Allianz Malaysia Berhad continued its tradition of camaraderie and appreciation today by hosting the 11th edition of its Allianz Golf with Media tournament, a long-standing event that celebrates media professionals through friendly competition on the fairways.\nHeld at the prestigious Saujana Golf and Country Club (SGCC), the 2025 edition welcomed 66 participants, comprising local media practitioners as well as senior management and employees of Allianz Malaysia.\nWith many corporate media tournaments having faded over the years, Allianz Malaysia's golf event stands as one of the few still thriving — and drawing a loyal crowd. This year's line-up featured regulars from media houses including New Straits Times, Berita Harian, Harian Metro, TV3, Media Prima, Bernama, China Press, Oriental Daily, Kosmo, Utusan Malaysia, The Malaysian Reserve, Sin Chew Daily, The Star, Astro, The Edge, Sinar Harian, RTM, and more.\nRepresenting Allianz Malaysia were Board Member Thomas Wong Kok Leong, Chief Financial Officer Giulio Slavich, and Chief Operations Officer Andrew Sim.\n\"At Allianz Malaysia, we truly value the role the media plays in informing the public. Their work helps shape an informed society, and this tournament is our way of saying thank you,\" said Slavich.\n\"We look forward to this event each year — not just for the golf, but for the chance to reconnect with our media friends in a relaxed setting,\" he added.\nBayu Adhi Cahyono of Al Jazeera emerged as this year's champion, carding 38 points and taking home a full set of Wilson Prostaff SGI golf clubs worth RM2,000. Redzal Ghazali from Sinar Harian also scored 38 points but settled for second place on countback, winning a TaylorMade Auth-Tech Cart Bag worth RM1,500. Third place went to Andrew Ng of Golf Malaysia, who scored 37 points and walked away with a Cutter & Buck Travel Bag worth RM500.\nIn the team category, Bayu teamed up with Sharif Omar (Media Mulia) and Loo Keng Yip (Par Golf) to clinch top spot with a combined score of 110 points.",
