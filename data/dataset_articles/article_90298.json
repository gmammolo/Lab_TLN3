The procured onions are being supplied to Rythu Bazaars, ration shops, and government institutions. (Photo | Express) K Madhu Sudhakar Updated on: 04 Sep 2025, 4:24 am 2 min read\nCopied\nKURNOOL: The Andhra Pradesh government has begun procuring onions at a Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 1,200 per quintal, providing the much-needed relief to farmers of Kurnool, following a slump in market prices.\nThe Kurnool Agricultural Market Yard, a major onion trading hub in the State, is now bustling with activity as the crop arrivals have picked up. Just a few days ago, farmers were hit hard by a market slump, with prices plummeting to Rs 200 per quintal due to low quality of yield following heavy rainfall, weak export demand, and an oversupply.\n“My brother-in-law Maddileti dumped 75 quintals of onions on the roadside last week due to lack of remunerative price for the produce. He returned home devastated,” said Boya Ponnakallu Naidu from Guduru.\n“Today, I sold 35 quintals of onions at Rs 1,200 MSP. Though it is not a profit, but the MSP for onions has saved me from debt,” the farmer added.\nMany farmers left crops unharvested due to unviable market prices, and mounting transport costs. Golla Ramachandra from Kadimetla village in Yemmiganur mandal shared a similar tale of recovery.\nAfter investing over Rs 1 lakh on two acres of onion crop, he brought 90 quintals of produce to the market on Wednesday. “It’s a break-even, not a gain, but this support has shielded me from major loss. I hope the State government will continue the MSP scheme until onion prices recover,” he said.\nMeanwhile, G Somanna from Ulchala village, urged the government to raise the MSP to Rs 1,300 per quintal depending on the quality of produce.\nMany farmers left crops unharvested due to unviable market prices, and mounting transport costs. (Photo | Express) Markfed procures 10,401 quintals of onions so far; maximum price Rs 1,215\nSpeaking to TNIE , Market Yard Secretary R Jaya Lakshmi highlighted MARKFED’s intervention, and said they have procured 10,401 quintals of onions since August 31, with the highest price hitting Rs 1,215 per quintal on Wednesday. She advised farmers to grade their produce properly, and avoid early crop harvesting for a better price.\nThe procured onions are being supplied to Rythu Bazaars, ration shops, and government institutions.\nJoint Director of Horticulture P Ramanjaneyulu said onions were grown in 35,000-40,000 acres this Kharif season. About 30% of the onion crop has been harvested so far. He warned that the bulk harvest of onion crop by this month-end may lead to price slump. Onion trader K Srinivasulu echoed this, highlighting decline in exports and lack of proper storage facility, terming the MSP a lifeline for distressed onion farmers.",
