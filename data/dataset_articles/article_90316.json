  "text": "CHANDIGARH : Panjab University witnessed history on Wednesday as the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) captured the president’s post of the Panjab University Campus Student Council (PUCSC) for the very first time since the formation of the council in 1977. The result ended 48 years of waiting for the right-wing student outfit, which had long been active in campus politics but never able to secure the top seat. ABVP’s Gaurav Veer Sohal, a 27-year-old research scholar in the Department of Laws, secured 3,148 votes, defeating independent candidate Sumit Kumar , supported by the Manoj Lubana group, who finished second with 2,660. Sohal’s margin of 488 votes sealed what many are calling the most significant turning point in the history of PU student politics. Last year, ABVP’s Arpita Malik finished third, while in 2023, Harish Gujjar lost the top post to ASAP (then CYSS) by 660 votes. Eight-cornered battle The eight-cornered contest saw NSUI’s Parabjot Gill finish third with 1,359 votes, followed by ASAP’s Mankirat Mann at 1,184. SOI’s Seerat managed 422, SOPU’s Ardas 318, PSU Lalkaar’s Joganpreet Singh 198, and Ambedkar Students Forum’s candidate 136. NOTA drew 188 ballots. The results highlighted the decline of several traditional groups. NSUI, once the most dominant force on campus, slipped to third, while SOPU, which last entered the council in 2012, remained on the margins. PSU Lalkaar too, the only left outfit to contest this time, finished with barely 200 votes. Independents and rebels, however, continued to show strength, echoing last year’s result when independent Anurag Dalal won the presidency. Parties ferry students to booths With rain keeping many students indoors, political groups took matters into their own hands. Parties arranged vehicles to ferry hostel residents to polling booths, and several leaders even posted videos on social media appealing to students to come out and vote despite the weather. The scramble reflected the importance of turnout in PU elections, where narrow margins often decide the outcome.\nEnd of Article Follow Us On Social Media Tired of too many ads? go ad free now Trending Stories In City Entire Website Tired of too many ads? go ad free now",
