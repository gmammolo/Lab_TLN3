  "text": "RUIDOSO, N.M. (KFOX14/CBS4) — Recovery efforts begun in Ruidoso on Wednesday after Tuesday's deadly flash flooding that decimated the area.\nAt a mobile home park in Gavilan Canyon, many residents came back to homes that had been destroyed... floors caked in a layer of thick mud, doorsteps piled high with debris, and some homes swept clean off of their foundations.\n\"This was my cousin's house. And we don't know where it is,\" said Darlene Apachito, a Ruidoso resident.\nMany were frightened by the impending floodwaters when warnings were issued on Tuesday, so they moved out of the way.\n\"We left like 30 minutes early because I said, 'We better leave. Look what happened in Texas. We don't know this time,' I said. So we left,\" said Apachito.\nFor others, it was a helpless feeling, knowing they could not do anything to stop the raging waters.\n\"I was actually across from the links the golf course and I ended up getting stranded there because the water just came so fast it was all over the road. We didn't know what to do and there was no way we could help,\" said Alexx Chavez, a Ruidoso resident.\nVolunteers were also out in full force Wednesday, helping residents pick up the pieces.\n\"I'm really happy that the community came out here and started helping people who live in poverty and trailer parks because it's hard, it's hard working from day to day and losing everything all at once,\" said Gisselle Villareal, a volunteer in Ruidoso.\nRain was not an issue for Ruidoso on Wednesday, however with chances for storms remaining in the forecast for much of the week, and with much of monsoon season still ahead, the flood threat looms.\nMany say that because of this impending threat, they do not want to stay.\n\"I just feel like the whole trailer park should get rid of-- I don't-- there's no more for us to be living here. Like, we're in danger,\" said Moraima Aguirre, a Ruidoso resident.\n\"We should have moved the first time, but we didn't, but now this one is scary,\" said Apachito.\nSign up to receive the top interesting stories from in and around our community once daily in your inbox.",
