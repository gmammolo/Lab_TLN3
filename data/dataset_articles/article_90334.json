  "text": "Indiana County 4-H youth leaders and volunteers recently shared with members of the Indiana Masonic Lodge Fraternal Order inspiring stories and highlights of the numerous opportunities available through the 4-H program. Participants, from left, are front row, pictured with Lodge members, Mary Ann Ostach, Youth County Council Leader; Riley Fink, State Project Ambassador for Shooting Sports and Camping and recently named National 4-H Shooting Sports Ambassador; Maggie Palfrey, State Project Ambassador in Leadership and Civic Engagement; John Bruner, Pennsylvania State 4-H Council; Angela Boring, 4-H Youth Development Educator; and Connie Bruner, county volunteer with several clubs. Jill Carr, Cloverbud leader, also attended. Members shared their stories, teamwork, leadership and personal development experiences. Volunteers shared reflections of working with youth and personal rewards of mentoring the next generation. Boring encouraged community members to volunteer and support youth development efforts, inviting them to “cultivate youth sparks and help them grow where they are planted.” Anyone interested in joining or supporting 4-H is encouraged to contact the Indiana County Penn State Extension Office at (724) 465-3880.\n4-H, Indiana Masonic Lodge members meet\nMost Popular\nImages\nVideos\nCommented\nSorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.\nSuccess!
