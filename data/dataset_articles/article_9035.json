  "text": "It’s been nearly a week since the Guadalupe River quickly rose and swept through Texas Hill Country, sending rushing water into campgrounds and homes.\nOn Wednesday, we got a look at the search efforts in the wooded areas along the riverbanks. Dive teams are combing through murky water, and rescue teams are also in the air and on the ground.\nWatch NBC 5 free wherever you are\n WATCH HERE At least 119 people have died in six counties. That includes 59 adults and 36 children in Kerr County. More than 170 people are still missing across the state.\nThe situation evolves daily. Several nonprofit groups that have arrived said they plan to remain on the ground for the next few weeks, providing physical, emotional, and spiritual support.\nGet top local stories delivered to you every morning with NBC DFW's News Headlines newsletter.\n SIGN UP Members of the group Kerr County Young Life gathered with the Kerrville community for a moment to embrace and reflect at Antler Stadium on Wednesday night. They said songs, prayers and words of encouragement are part of the journey to recovery.\nTivy High School coach and Kerrville native Chris Russ lost two close friends in the flood.\n“Usually when people can get together and share with other people, it helps in the healing process, so hopefully that’s what this can do,” Russ said.",
