  "text": "By Emma Kidger ,\n1 hours ago\n(FOX40.COM) — The new Senate Bill 98, Sending Alerts to Families in Education Act, co-sponsored by California State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, was approved by the Senate on Tuesday and is headed to the governor to be signed into law.\nOn Tuesday, Thurmond joined Senator Sasha Renée Pérez, legislators, and members of the California Latino Legislative Caucus at a press conference that was held on Tuesday in Sacramento to show support for the bill, officials said.\nAssemblymember’s bill defends birthright citizenship, heads to final vote According to the California Department of Education, the bill would require K-12 schools and higher education institutions to notify students, staff, and community members when immigration enforcement is present on campus.\n“SB 98 provides students and educators with peace of mind in the classroom while reinforcing the state’s commitment to ensuring that educational institutions remain safe spaces where students can learn, teachers can teach, and schools can focus exclusively on educating and uplifting the next generation,” Thurmond said.\nSen. Padilla promotes new bill at recent Sacramento Rapid Response Network roundtable The bill prohibits district employees from allowing immigration authorities to enter private areas of school sites for any purpose without a valid judicial warrant or court order, according to the California Department of Education.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
