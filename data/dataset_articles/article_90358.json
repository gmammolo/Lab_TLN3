the global crypto market cap soared 0.57% to $3.86 trillion.\nMeanwhile, Ethena leads the upside with an over 8% increase, fueled by bullish ecosystem news.\nThe project, known for its dominant yield-bearing stablecoin, announced a significant milestone on X.\nNotably, USDe supply on centralized exchanges (CEXs) has surpassed $1 billion.\nThat reflects growing adoption and confidence among the cryptocurrency community.\nThe remarkable achievement triggered optimism, with Ethena’s governance token surging over 8% over the past 24 hours.\nWhile most tokens presented limited price actions, ENA soared from $0.6774 to $0.733 after the stablecoin updates.\nThe $1B supply milestone raised eyebrows since the project only launched early this year.\nThat reflects impressive demand and increased recognition of stablecoins’ importance in the evolving financial landscape.\nInvestors and traders look attracted and confident in Ethena’s stablecoin model, which promises stability and yield opportunities.\nUSDe differs from stablecoins like USDT and Circle’s USDC.\nEthena’s is a synthetic dollar that uses futures and digital tokens for backing, while the established options rely on fiat for stability.\nUSDe leverages the delta-neutral strategy to hedge against market volatility, offering high yields on cryptocurrency-native savings.\nAccording to the official blog:\nHedging the price change risk of the backing asset in the same size minimizes fluctuations in the backing asset price, as the change in value of the backing asset is generally offset by the change in value of the hedge.\nThis enables the synthetic USD value of the backing assets to remain relatively stable in most market conditions.\nWhat it means for the stablecoin market\nStablecoins are among the most utilized tools within the cryptocurrency market.\nThe offer investors and traders dollar-pegged tokens that they can move and use to transact across exchanges.\nMeanwhile, the sector has seen notable changes lately.\nBesides the US’s clear regulations on stablecoin through the GENIUS Act, attention has switched to yield-bearing alternatives.\nMarket players want assets that can generate income while idle on trading and investment platforms.\nBy surpassing $1B, Ethena’s USDe cements its status as a recognized stablecoin after reclaiming the 3rd spot recently.\nWhile still far behind USDT and USDC, such a milestone confirms that Ethena has gained traction faster than most of its rivals.\nMoreover, it shows users’ willingness to explore new stablecoin models that incorporate stability and
