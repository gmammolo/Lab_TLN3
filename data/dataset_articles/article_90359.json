  "text": "Centre issues new rules on scribes for PwD candidates in competitive exams\nThe Centre has issued fresh rules for the use of scribes by persons with disabilities (PwDs) in competitive exams, aiming to curb malpractice and strengthen exam integrity. The revised guidelines mandate vetted scribe pools, promote assistive technology, and set stricter eligibility norms to ensure fairness and accessibility.\nIn a move to strengthen exam integrity and reduce misuse of scribe services, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has revised the rules governing the use of scribes for persons with disabilities (PwDs) in competitive examinations. The new framework requires exam-conducting bodies to build their own verified pools of scribes within the next two years, gradually ending the practice of candidates bringing “own scribes,” which has been linked to malpractice.\nThe updated rules cover all competitive public examinations related to jobs, admissions to professional courses, and technical programmes. They are aligned with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 and the Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024, and also reflect directions previously issued by the Supreme Court.\nSHIFT TOWARD INDEPENDENCE WITH ASSISTIVE TECH\nA key aspect of the guidelines is encouraging candidates to rely more on assistive technologies rather than scribes. Tools such as screen readers (JAWS, NVDA), Braille, speech-to-text software, large print formats, recording devices, and software-enabled laptops are recommended. The ministry stressed that reducing dependence on scribes will better prepare candidates for professional environments where independent functioning is essential.\nCONCERNS OVER OWN SCRIBE SYSTEM\nThe revision follows inputs from major examining bodies including UPSC, SSC, DoPT, and the National Recruitment Agency, all of which flagged vulnerabilities in the “own scribe” arrangement. Reports of malpractice have included instances where privately arranged scribes answered questions without proper dictation, undermining fairness and transparency.\nUntil official pools of trained scribes are established, candidates will still be allowed to bring their own scribes, but only as a last resort and for a maximum period of two years.\nSTRICTER ELIGIBILITY NORMS\nThe new framework also sets stricter eligibility requirements for scribes:\nThey must generally have educational qualifications two to three levels lower than the minimum eligibility for the exam.\nThey cannot be candidates for the same examination.\nConflicts of interest must be strictly avoided.\nCandidates with writing-related functional limitations will continue to receive compensatory time of at least 20 minutes per hour, irrespective of whether they use a scribe.\nACCESSIBILITY AND CANDIDATE SUPPORT\nThe rules mandate that exam centres be fully accessible, including ramps, lifts, wide corridors, ground-floor seating, and audio announcements. Special facilities like quiet rooms will be available for candidates with neurodevascular conditions or chronic illnesses.\nAuthorities must also ensure:\nRegular training in disability etiquette for invigilators and staff.\nAnnual sensitisation programmes for exam personnel.\nA grievance redressal system specifically for PwD candidates.\nCollection of feedback on the performance of scribes and incentives for empanelled scribes.\nDATA PROTECTION AND ACCOUNTABILITY\nAll personal and medical information of candidates must be securely handled under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023. Officials failing to follow the new rules may face penalties, while candidates or scribes engaging in malpractice can also be held accountable under the law.\nBy tightening rules, promoting assistive technology, and creating vetted scribe pools, the Centre aims to balance accessibility with fairnessâ€”ensuring that examinations for disabled candidates are both inclusive and credible.\nIn a move to strengthen exam integrity and reduce misuse of scribe services, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has revised the rules governing the use of scribes for persons with disabilities (PwDs) in competitive examinations.
