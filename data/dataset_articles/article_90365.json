The Harford County meetings had a wait list, and half of the women at each meeting in Belcamp, Md., were from Cecil County.\nAt the inaugural meeting in Port Deposit, Regner said that — moving forward — the Cecil County Chapter of Polka Dot Powerhouse will meet the third Thursday of each month at Granite Run Taproom. Mark your calendar for Sept. 18 from 3:30 until 5.\nTo register for the meeting, go to: https://tinyurl.com/3r8yfua7\nGranite Run Taproom is located at 26 South Main St. in Port Deposit.\n•••\nAquaBoost Pressure Washing, based in Rising Sun, has partnered with a like-minded Harford County company to start folks thinking about the upcoming holidays.\nWorking with UR Washed Power Washing LLC, the companies are offering to do the exterior decorating of your home or business with all that’s merry and bright.\nCall 443-252-1631 to make an appointment to get on their schedule.\n•••\nAn Elkton printing company is expanding its reach beyond Cecil County.\nLocated at 873 Pulaski Highway, Pacesetter Signs now reaches Philadelphia, Pa. with its custom sign design and application services. Pacesetter signs offers consultation, manufacturing, installations, repairs and maintenance as well.

This is a free show promising cocktails, music and good times. Smoke N Meats BBQ will bring the food truck. Play games and get ready for a sing along. Reserve your seat at: https://tinyurl.com/cytk6e3u\n•••\nCHEP Outpost, a thrift store that supports veterans in Cecil County, is in search of vendors, crafters, food trucks and more for its Sept. 13 Second Saturday event.

Both events run from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m.\nLocated at 124 Greenmount Road, off of US Route 1 between Rising Sun and Nottingham, Pa., CHEP Outpost has a tiered price list for participants for these outdoor, highly visible events. To sign up, go to: https://tinyurl.com/bdhpxfzd\n•••\nA Cecil College Nursing student is the recipient of a $2,500 scholarship from the Dunkin’ Baltimore/Metro DC Regional Scholarship Program.\nStephanie Hutchinson Maahs was one of 50 students, regionally, to be recognized and rewarded for academic excellence, leadership, and community involvement.\nMaahs, from Middletown, Del., called the presentation ceremony “amazing.”\n“Everything was so nice. It felt really good to be recognized for our hard work,” she said.\n•••\nThe Denim & Diamonds Gala hosted by BW Unlimited Charity Fundraising is set for Sept. 27 at Martin’s West in Baltimore to benefit After The Races.\nTickets are $125 per person.

An email can be sent instead to gracef802@gmail.com.\nAfter The Races operates as a non-profit organization on Appleton Road north of Elkton, taking in retired racehorses and rehabilitating them for private ownership and enjoyment. As the name implies, to attend the Denim & Diamonds Gala, one can go formal or go casual, or perhaps a little bit of both.\nMartin’s West is located at 6817 Dogwood Road in Baltimore, Md.\n•••\nAmber Askew, Chief Financial Officer for APGFCU, has been recognized as a 40 Under 40 honoree by the Baltimore Business Journal.\nAskew was listed with other young professionals who are making contributions in their communities as well as their industries.\n“Amber’s leadership and vision have been instrumental to our growth and continued service to our members,” said Becky Smith, President/CEO. “We are proud of Amber and her continued commitment to our mission and the communities we serve.”\nBusiness Beat is a weekly column on business happenings in and around Cecil County.
