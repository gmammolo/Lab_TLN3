  "text": "The Benue state House of Assembly Wednesday urged the state government to establish more agro-allied industries to encourage indigenes to engage in massive production of agricultural produce.\nThe motion was moved by Mr. Anyor Matu, representing Kwande east constituency, during plenary in Makurdi.\nMatu stated that the establishment of more agro-allied industries would enhance speedy development, raise the state’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and increase per capita income of Benue indigenes.\nHe noted that the industries would encourage mass production of agricultural produce by farmers, increase value addition, and boost production activities in the state.\nThe lawmaker highlighted Benue’s potential as a purely agrarian state, blessed with rich alluvial soil suitable for all types of crops.\nHowever, he lamented that the crops produced in the state are consumed without any form of value addition due to the absence of industries to process and add value to them.\nMatu added that the absence of agro-allied industries has contributed to high unemployment rates and low per capita income in the state.\nHe cited the example of Benue’s renowned yams, which are not processed into value-added products due to the lack of industries.",
