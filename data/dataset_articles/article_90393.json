  "text": "When Cindy Manfong saw an opportunity to return to her hometown to work on a project with students from her old high school, she jumped at it.\nThe Jingili, Mudburra and Mangarrayi woman is the Indigenous Literacy Foundation’s publishing projects editor.\nTravelling to Katherine, she was excited to meet the group of 12- and 13-year-old boys, who had a great idea for a picture book written both in English and Kriol for the younger children in the Northern Territory town.\n“They wanted to write about this crocodile and all the (local) swimming spots,” she told AAP.\n“Growing up around Katherine you’ve got to be really ‘crocwise’ so for them to make this book and turn it into a cute humour book for the kids to read and have a good laugh at, it’s really cool.”\nAfter workshops with the students, the result was the publication of Grinch det K’Taun Krok! (Grinch the K-Town Croc).\nGrinch lurks in the waters of the Katherine River, scaring kids any chance he gets until the locals have had enough and decide to take their revenge.\n“We wrote this book to teach other Aboriginal kids about our Community,” the students said.\n“The book is important to us because we get to read it and look at the drawings. We want to be role models for the younger generations.”\nRecently launched in Katherine to overwhelming community support, the work will be featured at Indigenous Literacy Day celebrations in Sydney on Wednesday.\nThe young authors are heading down for the celebrations at the Opera House, with some of them travelling to the city for the first time.\n“We feel nervous, excited and joyful at the same time. It’s going to be a long way trip from home” the students said.\nThe event will also showcase a film, hearing from First Nations people in Katherine, Warakurna in Western Australia and South Australia’s Ceduna about how storytelling makes their communities strong.\nIn remote Warakurna, more than 700 kilometres west of Alice Springs, educator and Elder Daisy Helen Tjupantarri Ward explains the Ngaanyatjarra seasons and how passing down knowledge informs children.\n“We educate them, storytelling at night laying them down, telling them stories about the sky, the stars,” she said.\n“Learning all these things through Tjukurpa (the creation period) and through our stories, when we talk all the things, the behaviour the respect, the safety comes through that.”",
