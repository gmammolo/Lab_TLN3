  "text": "Some stories are best told at the table. Indigo Indian Asian Restaurant, at Port Denarau Marina, proudly unveils its new menu — a heritage gourmet journey that brings India’s culinary past into the present with elegance and care.\nThis is more than a menu. It is a revival of dishes shaped by centuries of tradition, drawn from royal banquets, temple kitchens, and family gatherings.\nIndigo’s chefs have taken these time-honoured recipes and re-imagined them for the modern gourmet diner, preserving authenticity while elevating presentation.\nThe result is a dining experience that is cultural, refined, and unforgettable.\nThe journey begins with appetisers that capture the grandeur of India’s kitchens. Jhinga-e-Khaas, prawns marinated in cashew and cream cheese before being gently roasted in the tandoor, recalls the indulgence of Mughal banquets.\nThe smoky Tandoori Chicken, fiery yet tender, remains timeless, while Tandoori Paneer, layered with peppers and onions, pays tribute to both temple cooking and palace feasts.\nIn the mains, the heritage deepens. Lamb Shank Nihari, braised overnight with cardamom and saffron, evokes the patience and luxury of Mughal courts.\nFrom Bengal, Murgh Korma Rezala arrives delicate and aromatic, with yoghurt and cashew enriched by kewra.\nThe Parsi favourite Salli Gosht, with its tangy gravy topped with crisp potato straws, offers a playful yet noble touch. Completing the spread, Indigo’s\nLamb Biryani, slow-cooked in the handi style, layers saffron rice and spiced lamb into a dish that speaks of artistry and celebration.\nNo gourmet banquet ends without sweetness. Indigo’s Tri of Kulfi — malai, pistachio, and mango — a royal indulgence once made with ice hauled from Himalayan peaks.\nToday, it serves as a crowning finale to an evening of heritage and flavour.\nThe new menu launches on September 7 — just in time for Father’s Day — making it the perfect occasion to gather family and celebrate with a dining experience that feels truly special.\nThe setting at Indigo completes the experience. With its waterfront location at Port Denarau, lantern-lit ambience, and warm hospitality, the restaurant offers an atmosphere as memorable as the cuisine itself.\nIndigo’s new menu is not just dining — it is heritage retold through food. Guests are invited to savour this gourmet journey, where every dish tells a story and every evening becomes a celebration.\nLamb Shank Nihari.\nPicture: SUPPLIED\nPatrani fish – a Parsi festive dish.
