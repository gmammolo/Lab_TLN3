  "text": "A local veteran is climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro to support mental health awareness for fellow Veterans.\nGeoffrey Rash of Pocatello will be joining 24 other veterans on a climb to mount Kilimanjaro in Africa on Veterans Day.\nThe goal of the climb is to spread awareness for Veterans who struggle with their mental health.\nThe climb also lets veterans know that there are resources available to them.\nVeterans from all over the country will begin the 19 - thousand foot climb on Veterans Day.\nRash says this climb is very personal to him as a veteran as he just recently overcame some struggles with his own mental health.\n“Recently, I kind of overcame some mental health issues that, you know, veterans deal with on a daily basis. And I just thought that that this climb with fellow veterans and stuff would really kind of kind of show what's possible.”\nA GoFundMe fundraiser has been started for the climb to the mountain.\nSo far, $1290 has been raised with a goal of $5,000 needing to be raised. If you would like to donate, you can do so here.",
