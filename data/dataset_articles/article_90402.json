Pour homemade sauce over cooked rigatoni and cooked sausage.\nBasil. Stir in fresh basil leaves that have been thinly sliced. Gently stir pasta.\nRecipe Tips For Success Watch Pasta Carefully When Cooking. Make sure when cooking your rigatoni that you don’t over cook it. I generally cook my pasta for 1 minute less than the package recommends, but also check it before that by carefully pulling a pasta out of the boiling water and testing it’s doneness with a fork or biting into it to see it it’s al dente. This way you don’t get a pasta that is overcooked.\nUse The Best Ingredients. By using great quality ingredients, you get the best tasting pasta. I make sure to have really good olive oil, tomatoes and always fresh basil.\nHow To Serve Serve rigatoni recipe warm with a side of garlic bread and side salad if desired.\nLeftovers Serve any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
