  "text": "New user guide for Minnesota’s risk protection law, advocates say the law is saving lives\nThere’s an effort underway to raise more awareness surrounding a Minnesota law meant to prevent deadly shootings.\nWe’re talking about Extreme Risk Protection Orders — also known as ERPOs — which can temporarily remove guns from someone who poses a risk to themselves or others in a crisis.\nThe work to help more people know that ERPOs are available and how they work is shared in this new implementation guide, created by Hamline University’s Violence Prevention Project Research Center in partnership with the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.\n“This is coming from a place of care and compassion for a loved one,” Dr. James Densley, with the Violence Prevention Project, said about the ERPO law.\n“This implementation guide is intended to raise greater awareness,” Dr. Densley added.\nRELATED: Nearly 1 year in, Hennepin County officials discuss progress of new red flag law\nERPOs have been law in Minnesota since 2024, and in the first year, data shows 135 petitions were filed, with courts granting orders in 95% of the cases.\n“There’s a lot of evidence to suggest they are very effective in the case of suicide, but they also can be very effective in the case of homicide, and that would also include high-profile mass shooting cases, like what we’ve seen recently here in Minnesota,” Densley said.\nWhile the investigation into the Annunciation Church shooting continues, police have reported it does not appear an ERPO was sought for the suspect, despite evidence that the shooter may have posed a risk due to writings and videos indicating harm.\nAdvocates, while still reeling, are glad solution-based conversations are ongoing — advocates like Leah Kondes with Moms Demand Action spoke to 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS.\n“For me, if it saves one life, it’s worth it,” Kondes said.\n“We need to keep those positive trends going, and part of that is talking to people about it, educating ourselves. So if, when, God forbid, we need an ERPO, we know where to go and what to do,” she added.",
