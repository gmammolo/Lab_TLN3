The actor wrote the book with his Podcrushed cohosts Nava Kavelin and Sophie Ansari.\n\"Interrupting twin paternity leave to announce a live event @podcrushed at @symphonyspace Oct 14 NYC supporting the release of our book CRUSHMORE. Truly proud of this one. Please check it out! @podcrushed for all info,\" he captioned his video.\nIn the clip, Badgley whispers as he went on to announce the live event, before panning the camera to the feet of one of his newborns, reports people.com.\nHe is heard saying: \"There's tiny little baby feet right there. I don't want to wake them up.\"\nAhead of the little ones' arrival, the mom of four, 41, shared a picture of her baby bump on her Instagram Stories with a peace hand sign emoji on top of it.\nThe new additions to the family will join the couple's 4-year-old son, as well as Kirke's son Cassius, 16, from a previous relationship.\nWhile speaking with Access Hollywood on the red carpet for the premiere of the final season of Netflix's You, the John Tucker Must Die actor opened up about the importance of raising boys, noting \"pressure\" that's on him and his wife to \"raise them well.\"\n“They’re identical boys, so now we have four boys,” he shared.\n“You know, I do mean this sincerely. It sounds a bit tacky, but the world needs more good men, so you know, pressure’s on us to raise them well.”\nWhen asked to share his dad's superpower, the Easy A actor replied: “Well, it’s my patience until I’ve lost it, and then I’m just as bad as anybody else. But, I can be very patient.”\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",
