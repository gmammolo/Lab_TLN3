  "text": "Clayton County Register\nwebsite\nWaukon\nWaukon girls cross country team opens season with convincing triumph over eight-team field at Edgewood-Colesburg Invitational\n2 days ago\nThe 2025 season got off to a very promising start for the Class 2A fifth-rated Waukon girls cross country team, as the Lady Indians, literally, ran away with the team title at the Edgewood-Colesburg Invitational Tuesday, August 26. Placing three runners within the top 10 individuals of the 98-runner field, and all five of their scored runners within the meet’s top 23 placewinners, the distance Tribe tallied just 35 points to leave the rest of the eight-team field behind by more than 30 points.",
