  "text": "Inje University Haeundae Paik Hospital will provide medical support for the 2025 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit.\nHaeundae Paik Hospital announced on Wednesday that it has been designated as a partner hospital for the 2025 APEC Summit.\nIn May, the APEC Preparatory Planning Committee designated 24 hospitals, including those in Gyeongju and North Gyeongsang Province, as partner hospitals and held a signing ceremony. As the accommodations for heads of state and delegations from various countries during the summit were assigned to the Gijang and Haeundae areas, five additional hospitals in the Busan region were designated as partner hospitals. Haeundae Paik Hospital is among them.\nWith this designation, Haeundae Paik Hospital will be responsible for providing medical support in preparation for any emergency situations that may arise during the summit.\n“We are deeply honored to participate as a cooperative hospital for this international event attended by world leaders,” Haeundae Paik Hospital President Kim Sung-soo said. “We will contribute to the successful hosting of APEC through thorough preparation and swift response.”\nHaeundae Paik Hospital has operated as a Regional Emergency Medical Center, performing core functions in treating emergency patients and responding to disasters within the region.\nRelated articles\nkjh25@docdocdoc.co.kr",
