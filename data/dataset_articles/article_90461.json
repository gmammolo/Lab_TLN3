  "text": "The same day the Ship Bottom Police Department was recognized for its professionalism as part of its accreditation, its officers were lauded for the safe recovery of a child who wandered off from the Sixth Street beach after lifeguard hours before being found more than a mile away in Brant Beach.\n“So, unfortunately, it’s not uncommon for us,” said Sgt. Chris Biester, who received the call about 10 minutes after the parents began searching for their 6-year-old son. “You kind of go into, not the routine, but the guys here are pretty good at knowing what the responsibilities are and what to do in a timely manner to try to find whoever is missing.”\nOn Monday, Aug. 25, they were looking for Arslan Hussain’s son, who walked off as his parents were corralling their other children out of the water.\nIn a thank-you letter to Biester that was shared at the Aug. 26 borough council meeting, Hussain said after 10 minutes of searching lapsed and his son had not been found, the decision was made to call the police.\nBiester, along with Det. Anthony Lazlo, Patrolmen Chris Ford and Nicholas D’Andrea, and Ryan Dugan, a special law enforcement officer, arrived within two minutes of the call, according to Hussain’s letter.\n“After learning about the situation, Sgt. Chris Biester quickly mobilized a team of officers in collaboration with Long Beach Township Police Department, Surf City Police Department, Fire Department, and EMS. There were officers trolling the entire beach on foot and in UTVs within the next few minutes looking for our son,” Hussain said, adding 20 minutes into the search Biester called in drones (regular and infrared) to search the waters and shoreline.\nWhen asked what was going through his mind, Biester said, “Find this kid, find this kid. Literally.”\nBiester said Hussain was about 90% confident his son didn’t go back into the water because they were in the water all day and he was tired.\n“Nine out of 10 times, we get these a lot, and it’s just a kid wandering down the beach,” he said, adding all cases are treated the same and all information is broadly distributed to law enforcement beyond the local area. “The water takes you down a couple of streets, right? So, you’re playing in the water. You can get sucked down a couple of streets. Now, you’re walking out thinking you’re getting out at the same spot that you went in, but technically you’re down a few streets. Now, you’re looking around confused.”\nLazlo rode up and down the borough beaches looking for the child.\nBut the search wasn’t contained to the beach, Biester added.\n“We ask if there are places they’re familiar with, a candy store or something, to maybe walk to or want to walk to,” he said, adding the questions are asked because kids can be unpredictable. “You were talking about candy before you went to the beach and now, they’re kind of walking away. There are so many variables.”\nBiester said he believes in casting a wide net in these types of situations, instead of playing it safe and focusing on just the beach.\n“(Then) all of a sudden, you have a real serious situation,” he added.\nRoughly an hour after the call came in, Hussain’s son was found on the 33rd Street beach in Brant Beach by a Long Beach Township police officer. Lazlo took the ATV to the township, met the child and safely drove him back to his parents.\n“He was quiet,” Biester said of the meeting between the child and the officer. “The good thing, this being a shore community, the guys are around kids so much that by the time he came back, you could see he was comfortable (with Lazlo).”\nHe said Hussain and his family were ecstatic when the two arrived back in Ship Bottom.\n“In my 50 years, I have never seen such a well-coordinated, focused, and vigilant team of officers looking for our son as though it was theirs,” Hussain said. “Our heart felt gratitude to each and every officer and professional involved in finding our so. Salutations to Sgt. Chris Biester for his quick thinking, leadership, professionalism, and empathy. You have some of the best officers and professionals serving your wonderful beach community.”\nAfter reading Hussain’s letter, Councilman Tom Tallon, who chairs the borough’s public safety committee, said he has received scores of letters and emails that praise borough police for professionalism, but rarely mentions them because it is the level of norm in town.\n“Mr. Hussein’s email reminds us that this is not the norm everywhere,” he added.\n— Gina G.
