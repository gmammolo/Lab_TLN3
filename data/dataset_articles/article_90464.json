  "text": "By Kierra Frazier ,\n5 hours ago\nThe estimated Powerball jackpot for Saturday night's drawing soared to an estimated $1.7 billion after no tickets came up winners of Wednesday's $1.4 grand prize . It would have an estimated cash value of 770.3 million. Both numbers are before taxes.\nThe winning numbers for Wednesday's drawing were 3, 16, 29, 61 and 69, with a Powerball of 22.\nThe jackpot has an estimated cash value of $634.3 million before taxes, Powerball said.\nThere were no winning tickets sold for Monday night's $1.2 billion grand prize . There have been six jackpots of more than $1 billion in Powerball's 33-year history.\nJackpots rise as more tickets are sold when drawings approach. Wednesday's jackpot, which is also the sixth-largest in lottery history, surpasses a $1.326 billion jackpot that was won in Oregon in April 2024.\nNo one has won Powerball's grand prize since May 31, when a single ticket in California claimed a $204.5 million jackpot with a cash value of $91.6 million. So far this year, the jackpot has been hit four times.\nThe odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million, according to Powerball. Drawings take place every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday at 11 p.m. ET.\nIn 2022, a single ticket sold in Altadena, California, claimed a $2.04 billion jackpot, the largest in both Powerball and lottery history . The first Powerball drawing was in 1992.\nPowerball tickets are sold in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
