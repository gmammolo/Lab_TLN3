  "text": "Griffith City Council is reminding the community to park safely and responsibly around the new Griffith Base Hospital.\nTo improve safety and sight distances around intersections, yellow lines are being painted on nearby streets. These lines clearly indicate no stopping zones. Any vehicle parked along these lines may be subject to fines.\nCouncil continues to receive complaints of unsafe parking, including vehicles blocking driveways and parking too close to intersections. These actions not only inconvenience residents but also create significant safety hazards for drivers and pedestrians.\nTo support safer parking, Council reminds drivers:\n- Do not park across driveways or within 10 metres of corners\n- Always use pathways and safe crossings when walking to the hospital\n- Observe yellow lines. They mean no stopping at any time, this includes no parking\n- Fines apply for all breaches of road rules\nDrivers are encouraged to use the on-site carpark off Noorebar Avenue, which provides safe pedestrian access to the hospital's main entrance. Drop-off/pick-up zones, 15-minute parking and accessible bays are also available for convenience.\nCouncil thanks the community for their cooperation and reminds drivers that enforcement will continue, with fines issued for illegal parking.\nhere.",
