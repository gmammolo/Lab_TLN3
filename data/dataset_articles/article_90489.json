  "text": "NOIDA: Greater Noida Authority has granted in-principle approval for inducting co-developers to complete three group housing projects that have been stuck for over a decade. At its July 28 meeting, the Greater Noida Authority board approved proposals from Sobha Ltd, Opaa Realty, and Swarnim Buildhome LLP to take over and complete stalled housing projects. Officials said Atlaspur Construction and Developers tied up with Sobha Ltd for its Sector 1 project, Parsvnath Developers proposed Opaa Realty for its Pi Sector project and Aims Golf Town Developers sought the induction of Swarnim Buildhome LLP for its township in Sector 4. The proposals were vetted by GNIDA's finance wing and an empanelled chartered accountant firm before being placed before the board. \\\"Although the board has given approval, the final agreement depends on the cash flow of these companies and their plan to clear dues and complete construction,\\\" said additional CEO Saumya Srivastava. Officials stressed that in all cases, joint development agreements will be mandatory, binding both the original developer and the co-developer to jointly bear financial liabilities and project responsibilities. The Authority will also ensure that the Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-RERA) coordinates by granting necessary extensions and monitoring compliance. For homebuyers who have waited years, the decision offers a glimmer of hope. Aims Golf Town's Sector 4 project alone has 1,136 buyers across five towers. Of these, 476 flats in two towers received occupancy certificates, and 173 registries were executed. Work on the remaining towers, however, remains incomplete. Parsvnath's Pi Sector project involves 692 buyers, with four towers completed but seven others pending. Atlaspur's Sector 1 project, still in its early stages, was stuck due to litigation and cancellation of allotment. Clause 9 of UP's co-developer policy states that both the original allottee and the co-developer will be jointly responsible for clearing dues and completing construction. However, the policy leaves room for discretion as it does not specify detailed selection criteria. GNIDA relied on past precedents while processing these cases. Officials pointed to the example of the Hawelia Realtors' induction into SJP Infracon's Sector 16B project, where Hawelia agreed to clear dues of Rs 155 crore and a joint development agreement was executed. Similar safeguards will apply in the new approvals, with all correspondence routed to both parties and no unilateral action entertained once agreements are signed. The 70,555 sqm Sector 1 plot was allotted to a consortium led by Asteroid Shelters in 2010, and later subdivided. As dues on Asteroid's portion remained unpaid, the Authority cancelled its allotment in 2016. The state govt restored the allotment in Jan 2024 with some conditions. Atlaspur, subsequently, cleared 25% of dues (rs 76 crore) in March 2025, after which the lease deed was executed in April. In July, Atlaspur sought Sobha Ltd as co-developer, which declared a Rs 3,379 crore net worth and a five-year cash plan of Rs 1,504 crore. Parsvnath Developers was allotted 35,013 sqm in Pi Sector in 2006, but after dues remained unpaid and deadlines were missed, the allotment was cancelled in 2022. Reinstated by a state order in Nov 2023, the developer cleared Rs 9 crore in April 2025, with the rest payable by Feb 2026. In July, Parsvnath proposed Opaa Realty as co-developer. Though Opaa's FY24 balance sheet shows no construction income, it has a net worth of over Rs 160 crore and pledged to finish the project by April 2027. Aims Golf Town, meanwhile, was allotted a 4 lakh sqm township plot in 2010. It was reduced to 1.9 lakh sqm after court orders and further subdivided. Of five planned towers (1,136 units), two with 476 units got completion certificates in 2021, but only 173 registries were executed. Though 301 more registries were cleared in Nov 2024, none have proceeded. The developer has proposed Swarnim Buildhome LLP—formed in 2023 with six partners, and a net worth of Rs 74 crore, as co-developer.",
