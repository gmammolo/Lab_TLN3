  "text": "31 workers rescued after huge tunnel collapses in Los Angeles\nA portion of a huge industrial tunnel under construction in Los Angeles collapsed Wednesday\nAp Correspondent\nThirty-one workers have been safely removed from an industrial tunnel under construction in Los Angeles after part of it collapsed on Wednesday, the Los Angeles Fire Department said.\nThe collapse occurred 5 to 6 miles (8 to 9.7km) from the tunnel's sole entrance in an industrial section of the city. Aerial footage from local television showed workers being lifted up through the tunnel's entrance.\nSome workers on the other side of the collapsed portion of the tunnel scrambled over a 12 to 15ft-tall (19.3 to 24.1m-tall) mound of loose soil and reached several coworkers on the other side.\nThe workers were then shuttled several at a time by tunnel vehicle to the opening.\nParamedics were evaluating 27 of the workers removed from the tunnel.\nThe tunnel is under construction to eventually carry wastewater. It's 18ft (5.5m) wide, LAFD said. More than 100 LAFD workers were assigned to the scene, including those who specialize in rescues from confined spaces.\n\"LAFD has just reported that all workers who were trapped in the tunnel in Wilmington are now out and accounted for. I just spoke with many of the workers who were trapped. Thank you to all of our brave first responders who acted immediately,\" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a post on X.",
