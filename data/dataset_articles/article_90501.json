  "text": "Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim revealed on Wednesday that he had an unexpected encounter with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in China.\nIn a brief post shared on his official social media channels, Anwar said he exchanged greetings and pleasantries.\nKim’s presence at the summit has drawn international attention. Known for his preference for travelling by armored train due to heightened security concerns, Kim’s journey to China marks one of the few times he has left North Korea since assuming power in 2011. His participation signals Pyongyang’s intention to strengthen ties with regional powers amid ongoing global geopolitical shifts.\nFor Malaysia, the encounter carries symbolic weight. Diplomatic ties between Kuala Lumpur and Pyongyang were severely strained following the 2017 assassination of Kim Jong Nam — the estranged half-brother of Kim Jong Un — at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, an incident that led to a freeze in bilateral relations. In 2021, Malaysia officially severed diplomatic relations with North Korea after a legal dispute involving extradition of a North Korean businessman to the United States.\nThe SCO Summit, which gathers leaders from across Asia including China, Russia, and Central Asian states, has become a key platform for discussions on regional security, economic cooperation, and strategic alignments. Kim Jong Un’s participation for the first time adds an unusual dimension to the meeting, as North Korea seeks to project its role in broader multilateral forums.",
