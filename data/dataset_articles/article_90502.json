  "text": "It’s back to school time! And to celebrate, Rockaway Beach Autism Families held one last post-Labor Day hurrah to celebrate and give back to the community.\nOn Tuesday, September 2, RBAF hosted a Back to School Social, welcoming all to Callie’s. RBAF members gave out free backpacks and school supplies, books, toys and more for all kids in attendance while guests enjoyed food and drinks. As a special treat, The Rock-A-Wades performed some sing-along tunes for folks to enjoy, and in turn, as a special treat, RBAF’s Kami-Leigh Agard took a moment to present Kyle Wade with a birthday cake as he celebrated his 30th birthday that day.\n“A tremendous thank you to Tommy Callahan of Callie’s, who allowed us to use this space. Of all our back-to-school events, this has been the most peaceful and beautiful, and the icing on the cake is The Rock-a-Wades! The point was to celebrate with families who have a different life but a fulfilling life,” Agard said.",
