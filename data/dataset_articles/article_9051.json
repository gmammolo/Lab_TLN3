  "text": "The Los Angeles Fire Department said on Wednesday that \"31 persons, all believed to be tunnel workers, have been safely removed from the tunnel alive without visible injury.\"Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images 31 workers have been rescued from a collapsed tunnel in Los Angeles. The trapped workers were working on an 18-foot wastewater tunnel late on Wednesday. Over 100 responders were deployed for the rescue operation, said Karen Bass, mayor of Los Angeles. ADVERTISEMENT The Los Angeles Fire Department said in a statement late Wednesday that the cave-in happened at an underground excavation site around five to six miles south of the tunnel's sole entry point.\nThe tunnel was being constructed for municipal wastewater management, the fire department said.\nTrapped workers were able to \"scramble with some effort\" over a tall pile of soil and meet their colleagues on the other side of the collapse, then take a tunnel vehicle to the entry point, more than five miles away, said the fire department.\nADVERTISEMENT Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, said in an X post on Wednesday local time that all the workers trapped in the Wilmington tunnel were out and accounted for.\n\"I just spoke with many of the workers who were trapped. Thank you to all of our brave first responders who acted immediately. You are LA's true heroes,\" Bass wrote on X.\nBass said in an earlier X post that more than 100 Los Angeles Fire Department responders had been deployed to the site during the rescue exercise.\nMichael Chee, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sanitation District, told Business Insider that 27 of the 31 extracted workers were treated for minor injuries.\n\"A full engineering and safety assessment will take place immediately. There is no detail as to the exact cause of the collapse at this time and no estimate for when work will resume until the tunnel is inspected, cleared, and deemed safe for operations,\" Chee added.\nADVERTISEMENT The tunnel project was part of a $630.5 million contract awarded in January 2019 to Dragados USA, a firm known for its tunneling work for large-scale construction projects.\nThe Los Angeles County Sanitation District and ACS Group, the parent company of Dragados USA, did not immediately respond to requests for comment from BI.\nThis is a developing story.
