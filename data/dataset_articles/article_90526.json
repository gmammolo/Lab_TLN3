  "text": "Telegram has integrated non-fungible token (NFT) trading into its platform through The Open Network (TON) blockchain, as announced by Max Crown, CEO of the TON Foundation, on September 3, 2025. This update enables users to send NFTs as easily as sending a message, aiming to broaden digital ownership and foster NFT communities.\nThe integration follows Telegram's earlier initiative to convert animated gifts into NFTs on the TON network, offering unique digital artworks. Users can now send NFTs by selecting the Wallet icon, choosing an asset, and sending the NFT from the collectibles tab, enhancing the platform's appeal to a wider audience.\nTelegram Integrates NFT Trading with TON Blockchain\nShow Original\nDisclaimer: The content provided on Phemex News is for informational purposes only.
