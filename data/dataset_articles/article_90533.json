  "text": "Teens for Food Justice (TFFJ) and local schools with hydroponic farm systems, have been hard at work, providing produce for local seniors at JASA older adult centers throughout Queens. As the school year came to an end in late June, they reached a milestone of delivering 5,000 pounds of produce to JASA.\nTFFJ, a non-profit empowering youth through school-based hydroponic farming, launched its first school-based hydroponic farm in 2016 at a school in Brooklyn. The first in Rockaway arrived at the Far Rockaway Educational Campus in 2021. In 2023, Scholars’ Academy started their farm, and most recently, M.S. 53 Brian Piccolo middle school, began their farm in 2024. Together, the Rockaway-based school farms and many others through the city, were able to deliver 5,000 pounds of healthy produce to their JASA partners at including Rockaway Park Older Adult Center, Brookdale Village Older Adult Center, and Roy Ruther Older Adult Center.\nThis achievement highlights a powerful intergenerational partnership that is helping to combat food insecurity among local seniors and promoting healthier communities. With food insecurity remaining a pressing issue – especially among older New Yorkers – this collaboration between JASA and TFFJ offers a vital solution that not only directly addresses the challenge of food insecurity but also contributes to the overall well-being and health of Queens’ older adult population.\nTTFJ farms and local schools work closely with JASA, with some schools even hosting field trips for JASA seniors to come visit their indoor farms. In December, Scholars’ Academy hosted one such visit, and seniors were able to learn about and help out with the farm. With school starting up again, Scholars’ Academy, Far Rockaway Educational Campus, M.S. 53 and other TTFJ farms will get back to work growing and delivering fresh produce for the community. The next hydroponic farm systems are planned for P.S./M.S. 183 and Goldie Maple Academy.",
