  "text": "Credit: X GURGAON: Rapido has rewarded one of its drivers, Suraj Maurya, after he was praised for ensuring a passenger reached home safely during severe waterlogging and a seven-hour traffic jam in Gurgaon. Deepika Narayan Bhardwaj, who booked a Rapido ride from Preetampura metro station to Sector 46, said her one-hour journey stretched to nearly seven. Yet, Maurya remained calm and patient throughout. “Suraj is an absolute gem. He stayed calm through the chaos, never once losing his patience. And when we finally reached home, he just smiled and said, 'Ma'am, pay whatever extra you want'. People like him restore your faith in humanity,” Bhardwaj said. Maurya, 24, originally from Uttar Pradesh, explained why he continued despite the extreme conditions. “It was such a situation that I couldn't leave my passenger in the middle of nowhere. \"It was raining heavily, traffic was stuck, and waterlogging made it impossible to move. I thought, 'Okay, I can't leave the passenger in the middle of this',” he said. Rapido later recognised Maurya’s “heroic service” for his commitment during one of the city’s worst nights of flooding and gridlock.\nAbout the Author Anjali Singh Anjali Singh is a city reporter at The Times of India based in Gurgaon, where she primarily covers education, social welfare, labour , sports and condominium developments, among other topics.
