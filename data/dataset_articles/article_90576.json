  "text": "EFG ​Hermes Raises Target Price for Talaat Moustafa Group ( TMG ) to EGP 130, Citing‍ Strong‌ Growth Potential Cairo, ⁣Egypt – Investment bank​ EFG Hermes has reaffirmed its “buy” rating for ⁢Talaat ​Moustafa Group Holding ​(TMG), considerably increasing its price target to EGP 130 (approximately $2.71 USD) from a previous EGP⁤ 120. The upgrade comes as ​EFG Hermes identifies TMG as its top‍ pick within ⁣the Egyptian‍ market, fueled by robust performance and ambitious expansion plans.\nA newly released comprehensive report⁢ highlights TMG’s strong showing across all sectors in the​ first ⁢half‌ of 2025, a⁤ trend‌ analysts expect‌ to continue, particularly ⁣with anticipated strong sales from the north coast’s SouthMed project in the ​third quarter.\nDespite this positive momentum, EFG Hermes notes that TMG’s stock has yet to fully⁣ reflect the‍ company’s operational strength and recent positive developments. This includes its strategic expansion ​into new markets like Iraq and Oman.\nKey Catalysts for Growth:\nThe investment bank ‍pinpointed several factors poised to drive TMG’s stock⁤ performance ‍in the coming months:\nOman Project⁤ Launch: The initiation ‌of a new project in Oman is expected ⁢to be a ​significant positive catalyst.\nSaudi Arabia’s Banan Project: Increased sales within the Banan project in Saudi‌ Arabia, particularly following the implementation ⁢of a new foreign ownership law in ​January 2026, are anticipated to boost revenue.\nPotential Ras⁤ El Hekma Participation: Any proclamation ⁤regarding TMG’s involvement in ‍the ‌Ras El hekma project would further accelerate positive momentum.\nMassive Development Pipeline:\nEFG ​Hermes estimates TMG’s ‌total development sales portfolio at a substantial EGP 3.9 trillion ($78 billion), slated for sale over a 14-year ‍period extending to 2038.Projected sales figures are notable:\n2025: EGP ⁢458 billion (EGP 210 billion⁤ already achieved ​in the first half)\n2026: EGP 505 billion\n2027: EGP 523 billion\nThes⁣ projections do not include the forthcoming‍ Sharm Bay⁣ project, expected to add another EGP‍ 120 ‌billion to‌ the portfolio, nor do ​they factor in contributions from projects in Oman and Iraq.\nInternational ‌Expansion & Revenue Growth:\nThe report emphasizes that ⁢TMG’s growing international footprint will bolster its ability to generate crucial⁣ foreign currency‍ revenue.‌ EFG Hermes ⁢projects a significant 56% year-on-year increase in TMG’s development revenues, reaching EGP 41.2⁢ billion ⁤in 2026,followed by‍ a further 35%‍ jump in 2027 as unit​ deliveries are recognized. Revenue recognition ⁢from the Banan project⁣ in ‌Saudi Arabia​ is ‌expected ⁣to ‍begin in​ 2028, ⁤promising a‍ substantial leap in overall development revenue.\nStrong Fundamentals:\nunderpinning this optimistic outlook are TMG’s solid⁣ fundamentals, including​ a contracted sales ‍backlog of ‍EGP 364 billion ​(to​ be ​recognized over five years) ‍and a ​vast land bank spanning⁤ 125.9⁤ million square meters.EFG Hermes concludes that TMG’s expansion into the ‍Saudi‌ market, coupled with a favorable operating ‍surroundings, positions⁣ the company ⁣for⁣ continued ⁢sales growth and makes⁣ its stock⁣ a compelling investment opportunity within both the Egyptian and⁢ regional markets.\nKeywords: Talaat ⁢Moustafa Group, TMG, EFG⁤ Hermes, ​Egypt Stock market, Real Estate Investment,",
