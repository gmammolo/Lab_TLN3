  "text": "GRIFFIN — The Spalding County Board of Commissioners approved the first full rollback millage rate in 20 years at their Aug. 28 zoning hearing. The rollback is the millage rate that will provide the same amount of tax revenue as the previous year, regardless of possible increases in property assessments.\nFor Spalding County, the rollback millage rate will be 15.256 mills, a decrease of 0.294 mills over last year’s approved rate of 15.550 mills. By accepting the full rollback rate, the county is choosing not to collect additional revenue that would otherwise result from higher property assessments.\nCounty manager Steve Ledbetter presented the proposed rollback rate to the BOC, along with some statistics related to the growth of the county.\n“Over the course of the last census in 2020, we’ve actually had a considerable amount of growth in our community,” said Ledbetter. “The latest information indicates we have 71,847 members in our community. Our population has grown a little over 6.5%.\n“Spalding County’s demographics are you have roughly 21% who are infants to 6-year-olds, almost 60% who are of working age between 16 and 64 years old, and 19.4% who are above 65 and eligible for retirement.\n“Over the course of the last 10 years, our demographics have actually increased with the number of retirees who have come into our community,” he continued. “We see that solely through those who are filing homestead exemptions and those who have exemptions for the school system.\n“Residential properties, particularly our single-family properties, has had a steady increase in both count and assessed values over the last 10 years.”\nSince 2020, Spalding County has had a 7.6% increase in the number of residential properties, and a 7.4% increase in commercial properties. While the percentages are close, the actual numbers are not, as there are currently far more residential properties than commercial and industrial. Ledbetter said the county commission’s intent is to ease the property tax burden residential property owners are paying by attracting more commercial and industrial properties. He said they are doing that by zoning and development.\n“The decisions this board and the water authority have made over the last year by bringing sewer in for Arthur K. Bolton Parkway and moving us forward to increase both the commercial and industrial side is very intentional,” said Ledbetter. “The intent is to increase the number of commercial and industrial properties to offset the taxes for our residential population.”\nLedbetter noted that while some people in the county are claiming the rollback millage will be a 3.49% increase across the board for tax payers, that their claims are not true.\n“The reason it is not true is because since 2007, we have increased the number of residential properties by 7,000. That’s a lot,” he said. “Last year we increased and provided 1,000 permits for upgrades to our property and new properties being built.\n“If you add in the new growth, you’re going to see an increase in the amount of revenue that comes to us, but it also affords us through the rollback to make sure we’re doing what we need to do in order to reduce property taxes.”\nIn addition to the proposed rollback millage rate, the BOC also considered increasing the fire district tax for unincorporated Spalding County by 25% to 3.732 mills. Ledbetter said that is to provide the funding for a third firefighter per shift per station, which in turn will help keep the county’s insurance rates low.\nDistrict 1 Commissioner Gwen Flowers-Taylor made a motion to accept the 2025 tax millage rollback rate of 15.256 mills. District 3 Commissioner Reginald Watts seconded the motion.\nDistrict 5 Commissioner and Commission Chair Clay Davis said their ability to accept the rollback rate is because of the great work done by county staff.\n“The commissioners sat down with the county manager and said this is the direction we want you to go,” said Davis. “We want to reduce taxes on the citizens. The county manager has done a great job in making money for us somehow so we can get all the stuff done that we wanted to do.”\nThe vote to accept the rollback rate was 5-0.\nFlowers-Taylor then made a motion to adopt the fire district tax at 3.732 mills. Watts seconded the motion and it was unanimously approved.\nThe BOC was also required to adopt the Griffin-Spalding County Schools’ 2025 rollback millage rate of 16.395 mills. Davis noted the county adopts the rate to be able to send a total millage rate to the state.\nA motion by Flowers-Taylor to adopt the school system millage rate was seconded and unanimously approved.",
