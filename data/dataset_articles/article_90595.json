  "text": "Annie Nolan Helps Trial Participants Increase Activity\nResearch assistant puts her interest in improving quality of life to work in the KArAt Clinical Trial.\n3 de septiembre de 2025\nAnnie Nolan is a research assistant who is helping implement the Arthritis Foundation-funded\nHáblenos de su trayectoria.\nI first moved away from my beloved home state of New Jersey to attend Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, where I majored in cellular biology and philosophy. While I had been set on following a scientific path since grade school and my biology major was carefully planned, the major in philosophy was almost an accident. I took my first philosophy class during my second trimester and enjoyed it so much that I kept filling my schedule with more philosophy classes until I realized I had nearly completed the major. Philosophy proved to be a worthy outlet for my love for reading and writing and served as a nice complement to my biological studies. Philosophy also provided me with frameworks for investigating ethical issues related to my interest in science and fueled my interest in bioethics.\nI have always interested in issues related to access to health care, and I spent a significant amount of time as an undergraduate student involved with a local student-run nonprofit called FORT, standing for \"fortitude,\" which worked to fund students' mental health care. I started as a public relations assistant, collaborating with local businesses to sponsor events, and was elected CEO in my junior year. I now serve as a board member of the organization, helping current students serve the next generation of Dartmouth students.\nI also immersed myself in the outdoorsy culture at Dartmouth, swimming in the Connecticut River, going on hikes and taking advantage of the winter weather to play some of the greatest sports! Now, I live and work in Boston as a Clinical Research Coordinator at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\nWhat drew you to the field of science and research, and arthritis research in particular? ¿Qué esperas lograr profesionalmente?\nMy passion for science can be traced back to a lifelong love and appreciation for life itself. I was the kid who spent her afternoons in the mud collecting bugs and identifying trees and was completely fascinated by every new species I came across. As I matured, this interest transformed into a need for knowledge and a desire to preserve. I loved biology because it helped me understand how life worked and realize how precious life is.\nI entered the world of health care and research because I not only wanted to preserve life, but to improve it. One reason I am so drawn to\nProfessionally, I hope to pursue my interests in issues related to bioethics, health policy and access to care. The next step in this journey is earning my juris doctor, and I am currently applying to law schools to do just that.\nCould you describe what you do with KArAT?\nI am an unblinded member of the KArAT team and I directly deliver the intervention to participants. For KArAT, this means that I am a health coach. I use motivational interviewing techniques to motivate participants randomized into the experimental arm of the study to increase their physical activity following their total knee replacements. These efforts are complemented by financial incentives, which reward participants for meeting weekly step count goals. I almost always follow the same participants week to week through the entire duration of their six-month intervention period, so I am able to form strong personal relationships and observe first-hand the life-changing effects of total knee replacements.\nDo you expect KArAT to affect patients either directly or indirectly?\nKArAT is one of my favorite randomized controlled trials that I am involved in because I get to observe the impact that I and the study are having on participants. As opposed to some of our other trials, where we may have to wait for imaging to assess study success, I get some degree of instant gratification with KArAT where I get to see my participants get better each week. Although we will still need to wait until the study is over to assess whether these perceived improvements are clinically relevant, I am willing to bet that we are not only helping participants actively involved in KArAT, but that the study's insights will improve the lives of many more!\nWhat are you excited about in OA? ¿Qué debería entusiasmar a los pacientes?\nI am excited by what I perceive to be a recent shift in attention to taking advantage of non-invasive and drug-free techniques for preventing and managing OA, such as diet and exercise. Of course, surgical intervention and proper medical treatment are often appropriate and necessary, but it is important to pay attention to all pieces of the puzzle, and overall health and wellness are definitely among them.\n¿Qué más le gustaría compartir sobre su participación en la investigación de la artritis?\nIt is a privilege to not only be involved in KArAT, but with other studies funded by the Arthritis Foundation, such as\nAnnie Nolan is a research assistant who is helping implement the Arthritis Foundation-funded\nKArAT (Knee Arthroplasty Activity Trial) study. Las investigaciones han revelado que las personas que se someten a una cirugía dereemplazo total de rodilla(TKR, por sus siglas en inglés) no tienden a aumentar su actividad física después de la operación, aunque ya no tengan dolor relacionado con la artritis. The KArAt study is testing whether personal coaching and financial incentives can help people increase their activity levels after TKR.Háblenos de su trayectoria.\nI first moved away from my beloved home state of New Jersey to attend Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, where I majored in cellular biology and philosophy.

I loved biology because it helped me understand how life worked and realize how precious life is.\nI entered the world of health care and research because I not only wanted to preserve life, but to improve it. One reason I am so drawn to\nosteoarthritis (OA) researchis because I think this notion of improving life is often overlooked. Preserving life takes priority, but I believe it is our responsibility not only to prevent death, but to maximize quality of life.Osteoarthritis, like other chronic conditions, can significantly affect patients’ quality of life, but because it does not necessarily threaten life, it is rarely treated as urgent. I believe that arthritis research can be life-changing, and there is a huge opportunity to help a huge number of people in this field.Professionally, I hope to pursue my interests in issues related to bioethics, health policy and access to care.

By participating in multiple studies, I am able to gain a better understanding of the breadth of the field and am continuously amazed at the amount of work there is to be done.Manténgase informado.
