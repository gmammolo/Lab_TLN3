  "text": "Instagram has launched a dedicated iPad app, making it available globally on the App Store after years of only offering an iPhone-optimized version.\nThe app, which requires iPadOS 15.1 or later, now uses the entire iPad screen and introduces a new layout.\nUsers start on the Reels tab, with Stories displayed at the top, and a menu on the left for navigation.\nA new Following tab offers three views: All, Friends, and Latest, with the Latest showing a reverse-chronological feed.\nThe app also features a split view for messages and displays comments alongside reels, rather than over them.\nInstagram is owned by Meta, which had previously delayed optimized iPad versions of its apps.\n🔗 Source: Wired\n🧠 Food for thought 1️⃣ Meta’s iPad app design reveals how video consumption drives platform strategy Instagram’s decision to launch the iPad app with Reels as the default screen demonstrates how short-form video has become central to social media monetization.\nReels now accounts for 35-38% of user screen time on Instagram and contributes significantly to the platform’s ad revenue 2 . By making Reels the primary experience on the larger iPad screen, Meta is betting that immersive video consumption will drive higher engagement and advertising returns.\nThis aligns with broader industry trends where platforms like YouTube and TikTok have found that video content generates higher user engagement and advertiser spending compared to static posts.\nThe iPad’s larger screen provides an ideal environment for video consumption, and Meta’s strategic focus on this format highlights how hardware capabilities can influence content strategy and business models.\n2️⃣ The 15-year delay highlights how established platforms often deprioritize non-revenue-critical features Instagram’s belated iPad optimization reflects a common pattern where successful platforms delay feature development that doesn’t directly impact their core revenue streams.\nDespite being part of Meta, a multibillion-dollar company, Instagram’s leadership previously cited “lack of resources” for the iPad app delay 1 . This occurred even as Meta’s WhatsApp promised an iPad app in 2023 but only delivered it in 2024 1 .\nThe timing of Instagram’s iPad launch coincides with intensifying competition from TikTok in short-form video, suggesting that competitive pressure often drives feature development more than user requests alone.\nThis pattern shows how platform companies typically allocate engineering resources based on immediate revenue impact rather than user experience completeness, even when they have substantial technical capabilities.\nRecent Instagram developments",
