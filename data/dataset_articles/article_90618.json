  "text": "- CJ ENM Enters Indian Market With K-Drama Slate via Amazon’s MX Player\nLeading Entertainment Company CJ ENM is further strengthening its global footprint through an expanded partnership with Amazon, now extending to India via Amazon MX Player, Amazon’s free streaming service. The move comes after Amazon’s acquisition of MX Player, marking the first official content package deal between CJ ENM and the newly integrated Indian AVOD ecosystem.\nThe new agreement includes a package of 18 drama series from CJ ENM—many of which have already found success in global markets—that will now be made available to Indian audiences. As part of the effort to connect more deeply with local viewers, the titles will be dubbed in Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu, completely free to stream.\nLeading the lineup is Lovely Runner, the recent hit series that created a K-pop romance buzz, set to release on September 8, 2025. Following that, a collection of fan-favorite romance titles—My Lovely Liar, Twinkling Watermelon, Wedding Impossible, and Delightfully Deceitful—will be rolled out gradually over four quarters starting from the same date. With these already well-received titles, CJ ENM is set to captivate viewers in India.\nThis partnership is particularly meaningful as it not only signals a deepening relationship between CJ ENM and Amazon MX Player, but also marks a new phase in CJ ENM’s strategy to engage global audiences through localized content strategies.\nCommenting on the partnership, Amogh Dusad, Director and Head of Content, Amazon MX Player, stated, “The demand for global content, especially Korean dramas, has grown exponentially in India. Through this partnership, we’re bringing 18 premium K-dramas — including recent blockbusters — to Indian audiences on AVOD, many of them for the very first time. With international stories now available in localized languages, we’re excited to make these compelling shows accessible to viewers completely free.”\nAlso marking it as a significant milestone in expanding the reach of Korean content in India’s free streaming market, Sebastian Kim, VP of the International Content Business at CJ ENM said, “This launch is very meaningful as we continue to reach new audiences around the world.” He added, “The shows have already proven their strength in story, cast, and production, and I believe they will strongly connect with Indian viewers through our new partnership with MX Player.”",
