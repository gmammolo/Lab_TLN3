  "text": "Vanuatu is an archipelago of stunning natural beauty and profound cultural diversity. For one week each year, this diversity finds its most powerful and joyous expression not in a quiet ceremony, but in a pulsating, electrifying celebration of sound: the Fest Napuan. More than just a music festival, Fest Napuan is a vibrant testament to Vanuatu’s resilience, unity, and the enduring power of its kastom (custom) in a modern world. As it celebrates its 30th anniversary, its story is one of visionary ambition and community spirit.\nThe Roots: A Cultural Centre’s Celebration\nThe festival’s birth in 1996 was both strategic and symbolic. Conceived to commemorate the opening of the Vanuatu Cultural Centre and National Museum, it was the brainchild of the Centre’s director Ralph Regenvanu, the Curator of the Museum Sero Kuautonga, and French teacher Isabelle Lecorre. Their initial goal was twofold: to form an association of musicians to develop the local industry and to create a flagship event to celebrate Ni-Vanuatu sound.\nFrom the beginning, the mission was clear: to develop Vanuatu’s music industry by providing musicians with platforms and resources to grow. What started as a one-day event has since blossomed into a five-day musical extravaganza, now one of the most important cultural events in the South Pacific, attracting over 40,000 people annually to the Saralana stage in Port Vila.\nBuilding an Institution: The Nasiviru Association and Beyond\nThe initial goal of forming a musicians’ association was realized with the creation of Nasiviru, which managed the festival until its dissolution in 1999. Undeterred, the founders established a new charitable organisation in 2000 to secure the festival’s future. Under the continued direction of Ralph Regenvanu and a strong committee including David Nalo, Marcel Melthrorong, Tony Ligo, and Jenny Tasale, the event gained crucial momentum.\nThis new structure secured trust and vital sponsorship agreements with major benefactors like Unelco, TVL, and Air Vanuatu. This funding was directly invested into infrastructure, most notably the construction of the permanent Saralana Stage, which elevated live music in Vanuatu to a professional level. This financial backing also allowed Fest Napuan to begin inviting international acts, exposing local audiences to top Pacific talent and giving NiVanuatu musicians a chance to collaborate and learn new styles.\nNurturing Talent: The Bie Room and National Expansion\nUnderstanding that a scene needs nurturing, the committee tackled one of the biggest hurdles for aspiring musicians: the prohibitive cost of instruments and gear. In 2002, they built the Bie Room, a rehearsal space adjoining the Saralana Stage kitted out with a full range of professional equipment. This space became a crucible for creativity, facilitating collaborations and the formation of new bands.\nThis model of support expanded beyond Port Vila. Recently, Fest Napuan used funding to establish two new rehearsal spaces: the CANAL studio in Santo (run by its own dedicated committee) and another in Lakatoro, Malekula, overseen by the Alliance Française. This national growth led to the creation of a sister festival, ‘Lukaotem Gud Santo’, which runs alongside the main event, sharing performers and strengthening the musical network across the islands.\nChallenges, Resilience, and Self-Sufficiency\nThe festival’s journey hasn’t been without profound challenges, including political turmoil and natural disasters. Its greatest test came in 2015 when Cyclone Pam devastated the nation. In response, the 2016 festival was rebranded as a “Festival of Resilience,” becoming a collective act of healing and a symbol of the unbreakable NiVanuatu spirit.\nA major step towards selfsufficiency came in 2009 with a three-year sponsorship from Digicel. This allowed the committee to purchase all their own sound and lighting equipment, eliminating the need to hire from Australia. Since 2010, Fest Napuan has been entirely locally produced and run, a point of immense pride for the organization and a testament to its sustainable model.\nA Milestone Moment: The 30th Anniversary Celebration\nThis year, 2025, marks a monumental milestone: the 30th Anniversary of Fest Napuan. This is a coronation of its legacy and a testament to its profound importance. The theme for such an anniversary is one of reflection and forward momentum, echoing sentiments of “30 Years of Unity Through Music.”\nThe anniversary is a living archive, celebrating the thousands of artists, from legendary bands like Vatdoro, Naio, and Huarere to international guests like The Black Seeds (NZ) and Paula Fuga (Hawaii), who have graced its stage. It is a tribute to the entire community, from the founders to the small army of volunteers who set up the stages each year.\nThe festival’s impact is vast. It has expanded to include dedicated days like Fest Nalenga (string band music), Fest Zion (gospel harmonies), and the newest addition, Fest Tamariki, where school children perform, fostering talent from a young age. Each year, a new theme addresses social issues, from “Women In Music” to “Fight Against Corruption,” proving the event is a platform for cultural discourse as much as entertainment.\nThe Unpaid Architects: A Legacy of Volunteerism\nThe enduring success of Fest Napuan is a testament to its charitable, not-for-profit status and the “incredible talent and commitment of the people behind the scenes.” Managed by an industrious, all-volunteer committee, countless hours are dedicated to every aspect, from funding to international liaison.\nAfter over a decade as chairman, Ralph Regenvanu passed the torch to Richard Shing in 2011. The committee, including multi-talented individuals like treasurer Luke Johnston (who took over from Jenny Tasale after her 11-year commitment), production head Marke Lowen, and local band coordinator Bobby Shing, ensures every dollar invested goes back into nurturing Vanuatu’s music.\nMore Than Music: The Enduring Legacy\nFrom a one-day event in 1996, Fest Napuan has undeniably shaped the course of Vanuatu’s musical history. It has created the fertile soil upon which the seeds of local music grow and flourish.It has:\n• Preserved Culture: By incentivizing kastom music and string bands, it ensures traditions are valued by new generations.\n• Promoted Unity: It acts as an annual reminder of shared identity under the common banner of NiVanuatu creativity.\n• Given a Voice: It provides a powerful platform for social and environmental messaging.\nAs it enters its fourth decade, Fest Napuan faces new challenges but does so on an unshakable foundation. It is the sound of tradition dancing with innovation, of resilience overcoming adversity, and of a thousand voices—across thirty years—singing together as one. It is, in every sense, the rhythm of unity",
