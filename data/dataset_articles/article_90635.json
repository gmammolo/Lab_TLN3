He mentioned that thanks to the multiculturalism policy founded by National Leader Heydar Aliyev and successfully continued by President Ilham Aliyev, the country has become a global model for intercultural dialogue, tolerance, and coexistence.\nNoting that the forum’s theme is no coincidence, Hasanov emphasized that youth play a crucial role in ensuring peace, dialogue, and mutual understanding in today's world.\nSpeaking at the event, Dinara Guliyeva, Head of the Human and Social Sciences Sector at ICESCO, highlighted that this forum marks a new phase in the productive partnership between ICESCO and Azerbaijan.\nNamira Negm, Director of the African Union's Africa Migration Observatory, Noufal Abboud, Director of the Nordic Center for Conflict Transformation, and other speakers underscored that the Forum is a crucial platform for international youth cooperation.\nFollowing the opening ceremony, ICESCO and its Baku Regional Office, in collaboration with the African Union’s African Migration Observatory and the Nordic Center for Conflict Transformation, hosted a workshop titled \"The Power of Diversity: Youth as a Driving Force for Peace and Understanding.\" The event explored the role of cultural and identity diversity in peacebuilding, highlighting the vital importance of youth participation as a catalyst in this process.\nThe Forum brings together about 70 participants from more than 50 countries. Events will take place in Baku, Khankendi, and Shusha, featuring panel discussions, interactive sessions, training programs, and cultural visits to Azerbaijan’s liberated historical lands.\nThe Forum serves as a platform for young people of different nations, religions, and cultures to promote multicultural values, strengthen inter-religious understanding, and encourage tolerance.
