  "text": "007 First Light has shown off new gameplay and a release date.\nIO Interactive’s upcoming James Bond video game, 007 First Light, has officially set a release date: 27 March, 2026. The developer showed off gameplay and more details from the game during a State of Play presentation held this week. A collector’s edition for the game was also revealed, including a few collectibles for a US$299 price tag.\nNew gameplay for 007 First Light unveiled\nThis week’s PlayStation State of Play presentation showcased over half an hour’s worth of gameplay footage from 007 First Light. The footage was taken from “an extended mission playthrough” following Bond as he hunts down agent 009, who appears to have fallen out of the Mi6’s good graces. To do so, Bond disguises himself as a valet–only to have to chase 009 out of the building with another secret agent in tow.",
