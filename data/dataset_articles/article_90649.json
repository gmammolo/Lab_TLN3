  "text": "WATCH: Titusville Police Officer Shows Professionalism, Pride and Community-First Mindset\nBy Space Coast Daily // September 4, 2025\nTPD emphasizes that service goes beyond responding to emergencies\nWATCH: Last week, a familiar scene unfolded on the roadside when a Titusville police officer stopped to assist a motorist struggling with a flat tire.\nBREVARD COUNTY • TITUSVILLE, FLORIDA – Last week, a familiar scene unfolded on the roadside when a Titusville police officer stopped to assist a motorist struggling with a flat tire.\nWhat made this moment stand out was not only the officer’s willingness to help but also his ability to put years of prior experience to work.\nBefore joining law enforcement, TPD Officer Quick spent nearly a decade working as a mechanic. That background made the task of getting the stranded driver safely back on the road second nature, and with a little muscle, he had the vehicle ready to go in no time.\n“The Titusville Police Department emphasizes that service goes beyond responding to emergencies,” said a Titusville police spokesperson.\n“Every call, whether large or small, is an opportunity to show professionalism, pride, and a community-first mindset. Officer Quick’s actions serve as an example of how officers can use their diverse skills to build trust and strengthen the bond between the department and the community. By stepping in to lend a hand, Officer Quick not only solved a problem on the roadside but also demonstrated the mission of teamwork and service that the department works to uphold each day.”\nThe Titusville Police Department is deeply embedded in its community. It emphasizes modern policing standards, community engagement, diversity, and historical legacy—all while delivering public safety and law enforcement services tailored to its city.\nThe Titusville Police Department serves a population of approximately 50,000, with the primary mission of maintaining public safety, enforcing state laws, and upholding city ordinances.\nHeaded by Chief John Lau, the department’s hierarchy includes Deputy Chief Todd Hutchinson and Commander Matt Demmon and consists of six main divisions, including Patrol, Investigations, Professional Standards, Administrative, Support Services, and Tactical Operations.\nTogether, the Patrol and Investigations divisions form the Operations Bureau, typically overseen by an Assistant Chief, with each division led by a major.\nThe department employs a total of 154 personnel, including 94 sworn officers and 53 civilian staff. The annual operating budget stands at approximately $12 million.\nSpecial units include the K-9 Unit, established in the 1960s by Chief Jim Erwin, which now provides 24/7 K-9 support through modern operations. The Special Weapons and Tactics Team was ranked fifth globally in a 2024 SWAT competition and remains the highest-performing team in Brevard County.\nThe Community Watch Program was founded in 1993. This “Citizens on Patrol” initiative trains volunteers to serve as extra eyes and ears in neighborhoods and public areas. These volunteers report suspicious activity, but do not carry arms or make arrests.",
