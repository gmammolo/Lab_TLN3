  "text": "Missouri. The $8.7 million project is expected to create 41 jobs.\nThe investment will include the construction of three new regional headquarters.\n“Our decision to expand into Missouri reflects both confidence in these communities and our commitment to contributing to their future,” said Andy Beery, Founder and CEO of Acculevel. “By creating good-paying jobs, supporting local suppliers, and delivering unmatched foundation repair expertise, we’re investing in the economic strength and stability of the region. We’re proud to be part of Missouri’s growth story.”\nTo support the project Acculevel will benefit from the Missouri Works program, a tool that helps companies expand and retain workers by providing access to capital through withholdings or tax credits for job creation.\n“Acculevel’s decision to establish not just one, but three new regional headquarters in Missouri is a powerful statement about the strength of our state,” noted Subash Alias, CEO of Missouri Partnership. “By investing in Kennett, Sarcoxie, and Smithville, Acculevel is bringing opportunity to multiple regions, creating good-paying jobs, and reinforcing Missouri’s reputation as a place where businesses can grow and communities prosper.”\nAcculevel specializes in repairing cracked foundations, basement and crawl space issues, concrete leveling, and waterproofing.\n“We’re grateful for the trust Acculevel has placed in our state as it establishes these new locations,” added Michelle Hataway, Director of the Department of Economic Development. “DED is excited to support this company as it invests, creates jobs, and helps Missourians prosper in Kennett, Sarcoxie, and Smithville.\n“Acculevel’s decision to expand here is a commitment to Sarcoxie’s people and the potential of our region,” said Amy Kauffman, Executive Director of MOKAN Partnership. “These new, high-paying jobs will boost economic growth and deliver meaningful, long-term benefits to our local communities.”",
