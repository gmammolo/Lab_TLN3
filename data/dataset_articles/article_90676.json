  "text": "Marshall law enforcement, first responders engage with residents at National Night Out\nPublished 10:45 pm Wednesday, October 8, 2025\nIt was a community affair Tuesday as the Marshall Police Department held its annual National Night Out event featuring emergency demonstrations, vendors, food and more.\n“National Night Out is an annual event that is designed to kind of bring the community and law enforcement together in a positive manner,” said Marshall Police Chief Cliff Carruth.\nHe said it’s grown throughout the years with participation of other agencies, including Marshall Fire Department and EMS, Harrison County Sheriff’s Office and more.\n“Now we’ve expanded it,” Carruth said. “So it’s the first responders (participating), but for us and as a police chief, we want to get our community and our officers together in something that’s fun, where they’re meeting each other and talking in something that’s really positive.\n“So we’ve got squad vehicles displayed. It’s an opportunity. Our SWAT operators or traffic officers are out so people can talk to them and get to know them. And I think that’s important.”\nHe noted the various demonstrations showcased at Tuesday’s party, including a Jaws of Life rescue demonstration by fire officials and K-9 drug detection demonstrations by police.\n“It’s demonstrations of things we do, but it’s in a positive environment,” Carruth said. “I think it’s important.”\nCarruth said he believes it’s important to have such positive interaction, particularly with children, who oftentimes only see law enforcement during unfortunate and negative situations.\n“The kids’ interaction is important because we want them to see the officers in something positive, instead of at a traffic accident or (when issuing) a ticket, or (because of) theft,” he said. “And this is very positive, so that’s great.”\nHarrison County Sheriff Brandon “BJ” Fletcher echoed Carruth.\n“Our involvement as the sheriff’s office is to let the people know that we are here for them, and we are here for whichever direction that goes – us for them, them for us – but also for the kids to know that they can lean on us, they can trust us, and they can they can rely on us to not only be there for them, but they need to see us in a happy environment,” the sheriff said. “A lot of these children don’t get to do that. A lot of times when they see us, it’s at their home or somewhere else. It’s not the best environment at the time, and it gives us a reputation of ‘the bad cop.’\n“We want them to know that that’s not the way it is,” Fletcher said. “We’re all people. We’re all here to serve each other and protect each other, and especially protect them, along with our community. And I think this night is a great night to resemble that. So, I think it’s very important, and we’re proud to be a part of it.”\nRaylon Westbrook, of Jefferson, said she always enjoys bringing her children to the police department’s National Night Out event in Marshall.\n“We come every year to Marshall. We normally go to Jefferson, but sometimes we come to Marshall because it’s more things to do and more people to talk to,” Westbrook said. “We love it.”\nMary Kirkwood won a bicycle raffle by vendor Timber Village Apartments.\n“Happy,” Kirkwood said of how she felt after winning, adding she planned to gift the prize to her granddaughter.\nIn addition to Timber Village, other participating vendors included Cypress Junior Women’s Club, Community Healthcore, Marshall Parks and Recreation, Ryan’s Crossing, Patterson, ADT Advantage, Lyte Fiber, WIC, Martin House Children’s Advocacy Center, Cammack Funeral Services and more.\n“It’s a community builder, it’s a friendship builder, it’s a trust builder, and it’s made to create bonds between community and first responders,” Fletcher concluded about the National Night Out. “And not just that, but communities among neighborhoods, because people just don’t talk as much as they used to. It’s an opportunity to meet your neighbors and visit with your neighbors and understand who’s around you and build a trust bond with those people to become one.”",
