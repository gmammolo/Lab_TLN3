  "text": "Smart Hub 7 Plus set to bring WiFi 7 to the masses\nThe upcoming WiFi 7 router is expected to be available to EE customers in the coming months\nNews\nQuick Summary\nNew EE router to be called the Smart Hub 7 Plus, offering WiFi 7 connections for its 500Mbps and 900Mbps packages. Will be paired with a Smart WiFi 7 Plus extender.\nMore details of the upcoming mid-range EE WiFi 7 router have emerged. Expected to sit below the current Smart Hub Pro device, the new router will be called the Smart Hub 7 Plus and will be offered with the Full fibre 500Mbps and 900Mbps packages.\nShown above with the Smart WiFi 7 Plus extender, which can be placed anywhere in the home to extend your signal, the Smart Hub 7 Plus is expected to replace the original Smart Hub Plus unit that we tested last year.\nThe extender units have traditionally created a Mesh network through your house to boost the signal and offer LAN ports to plug in devices directly if you wish. This could potentially solve the age-old problem of having your main router sat next to your TV – where the interference causes the signal to drop. Instead, you can place the extender by the TV and have the main router in a more central location – providing your broadband connection allows it.\nA new image also shows the rear of the upcoming Smart Hub 7 Plus, which includes 1x 2.5Gbps Ethernet and 3x 1Gbps Ethernet ports in addition to the WAN port, which is the same as the current Smart Hub Plus. There is also a phone input, so in theory you could use this router with part-fibre broadband connections as well. Another interesting change is the use of a USB-C slot for power rather than a standard round power plug.\nAs more devices start to offer WiFi 7 connections, this router will provide faster speeds and more stable connections. Currently, WiFi 7 is used on the latest Apple, Samsung and PlayStation devices.\nGet all the latest news, reviews, deals and buying guides on gorgeous tech, home and active products from the T3 experts\nAs T3's Editor-in-Chief, Mat Gallagher has his finger on the pulse for the latest advances in technology.
