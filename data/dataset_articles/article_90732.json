  "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — Indiana Fever center Aliyah Boston has been named to the WNBA All-Defensive Second Team, the league announced today, the first time Boston has received the honor.\nBoston finished the season fourth in total rebounds across the WNBA, recording 361 in 34 games played. Boston’s rebound total set a new franchise record for most in a single season, surpassing the previous record set by herself in both 2023 and 2024, meaning she has set a new record in each of her three years with the Indiana Fever since being drafted No. 1 overall in the 2023 WNBA Draft.",
