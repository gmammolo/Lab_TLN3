  "text": "Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Municipalities and Housing (MOMAH) approved the updated Executive Rules for the Regulations of Municipal Violations Penalties, in an attempt to boost compliance efficiency across the Kingdom's cities.\nThe new rules provide a unified regulatory framework for the implementation of municipal penalties and control monitoring, assessment, and fines mechanisms, state-run SPA reported.\nThe updated rules classify violations as either major or minor. They also specify the appropriate penalties for each, including financial fines, temporary closure, and license revocation, with an automatic escalation of penalties in case of recurrence.\nThe ministry explained that fines may reach up to SAR 2 million for certain major violations and SAR 1 million for other infringements. Penalties are calculated based on violation type, municipal classification, and the size of the violating establishment.\nViolators of minor offenses are granted a grace period to rectify their situation before penalties are imposed.\nThe updated rules stipulate that violations are to be detected and recorded electronically through the “Momtathl” and “Efaa” platforms to ensure quick processing, accurate documentation, and transparent handling.\nThe rules also grant municipalities the authority to seize vehicles or equipment abandoned in public areas and sell them through public auctions. In addition, they may disconnect power from sites that fail to correct major violations in accordance with the relevant regulations.\nLast June, the updated Executive Rules for the Regulations of Municipal Violations Penalties were ratified by MOMAH Minister Majid Al-Hogail.",
