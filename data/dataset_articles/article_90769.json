  "text": "Todd Betzold\nNews writer\nNorth Carolina lottery players are about to get a brand-new way to chase big wins. Starting this fall, Powerball tickets in the state will come with a fresh twist that could make your lucky numbers work overtime. It’s a feature that’s already been catching on in other states and now, Tar Heel players are next in line to give it a try.\nDouble the reasons to play Powerball\nThe North Carolina Lottery has announced that Powerball players in the state will soon have double the reasons to play the multi-state draw game. How so? With the introduction of Powerball Double Play.\nDouble Play is an add-on feature that gives Powerball players a second chance to win cash prizes of up to $10 million. With this add-on feature, players can win prizes in both the regular Powerball drawing and the Double Play drawing, which takes place immediately after the Powerball drawing.\nPowerball players in North Carolina can start adding on the Double Play feature beginning with the Monday, October 6, 2025, drawing.\nHow does the Double Play add-on feature work?\nThe Double Play add-on feature is optional and costs just $1 per play. Players who choose this add-on feature will use their same numbers from the Powerball drawing in the Double Play drawing.\nWhen purchasing your ticket at a lottery retailer, just ask the clerk to add Double Play to your ticket. If you are purchasing from a lottery vending machine, the North Carolina Lottery website, or app, you will select the Double Play option.\nPlayers must remember that Double Play is only available as an add-on when purchasing a standard Powerball ticket. If you buy a $2 standard Powerball ticket, the cost would be $3 total to add the Double Play feature.\nWhere is Double Play offered?\nThe Double Play add-on feature is not a new feature to the Powerball game. It’s just now becoming available to North Carolina players. Kansas Lottery players also recently added the Double Play option, which debuted on September 22, 2025.\nDouble Play is not available in every state or region that offers Powerball. The following states currently offer Double Play: Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas (starting Sepetember 22), Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina (starting October 6), Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Washington.\nWhat are the cash prizes for Double Play?\nFor the Double Play add-on feature, the cash prizes pay out as follows:\n- 5 out of 5 + Powerball – $10 million\n- 5 out of 5 – $500,000\n- 4 out of 5 + Powerball – $50,000\n- 4 out of 5 – $500\n- 3 out of 5 + Powerball – $500\n- 3 out of 5 – $20\n- 2 out of 5 + Powerball – $20\n- 1 out of 5 + Powerball – $10\n- Powerball – $7\nAgain, the Double Play option becomes available starting with the Monday, October 6 drawing, so spread the word and start getting excited about doubling your chances at winning big money.\nEnjoy playing the North Carolina Lottery, and please remember to play responsibly.",
