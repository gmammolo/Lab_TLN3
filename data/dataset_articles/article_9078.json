  "text": "Screengrab shows rapid water rushing down the Mount Kinabalu climbing route as climbers make their way down.\nKOTA KINABALU (July 10): Several climbers were trapped on Mount Kinabalu following heavy rain and a flash flood this morning.\nNo injuries were reported in the incident.\nVideo footage circulating online showed climbers clinging to ropes while making their way down the mountain as fast-moving waters cascaded down around them.\nA statement on the official Mount Kinabalu Facebook page said weather conditions began to deteriorate early in the morning, with continuous rainfall causing the climbing route to become dangerously slippery — particularly near streams and rocky sections.\nSabah Parks has since issued a safety advisory, urging all climbers to strictly follow safety instructions and to never proceed without the supervision of an accredited mountain guide.\nA malim gunung (mountain guide), who declined to be named, said such occurrences are not unusual during heavy downpours.\n“Every time it rains heavily, there’s a real risk of flash floods. The trail becomes extremely slippery. We always advise climbers to stop and seek shelter when conditions turn dangerous,” he said.\nHe also reminded climbers to always carry rain gear and basic safety equipment, as well as to never attempt the climb alone or without a guide.\nAs of this afternoon, no untoward incidents have been reported.\nSabah Parks is continuing to monitor weather conditions to ensure the safety of climbers still on the mountain.\nStanding at 4,095 metres, Mount Kinabalu is a popular climbing destination for both domestic and international adventurers.\nHowever, weather conditions remain a critical factor in ensuring the safety and success of any climb.",
