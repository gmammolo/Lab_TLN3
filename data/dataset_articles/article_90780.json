  "text": "Matthew Fazelpoor//October 9, 2025//\nThe New Jersey Economic Development Authority board approved an operator to manage and oversee its new landing pad for international companies.\nAs NJBIZ reported in June, the agency announced the creation of the New Jersey Business Acceleration and Softlanding Ecosystem (NJ BASE) in Jersey City.\nLocated at 3 Second St., the landing pad will establish a first-of-its-kind facility in New Jersey. It aims to attract foreign companies in key industries critical to the state’s economy, such as:\nIt will also offer coworking space, marketing services and more.\nSOSA, a leading global technology and innovation consulting firm, will operate NJ BASE. The selection followed a competitive review process, according to the NJEDA.\nSOSA has more than a decade of experience. It has run over 40 international accelerator and landing programs in partnership with government and corporations worldwide.\n“The NJEDA is excited to partner with SOSA on launching NJ BASE and welcoming foreign companies to the Garden State,” said NJEDA Chief Executive Officer Tim Sullivan. “Under Gov. [Phil] Murphy’s leadership, New Jersey has made impactful investments to diversify our economy and create new jobs.\n“NJ BASE will strengthen our state’s position on the global stage by helping entrepreneurs scale their businesses, foster innovation, and build lasting international partnerships.”\n“SOSA is proud to partner with the NJEDA to launch and operate NJ BASE, New Jersey’s first landing pad for innovative, technology-driven international companies,” said Uzi Scheffer, CEO of SOSA. “Building on over a decade of experience running landing pad programs around the world, we’ll help international companies land, forge commercial relationships, and scale in New Jersey.\n“NJ BASE will collaborate with leading international companies and key players across the state’s economy to create lasting commercial success, strengthening New Jersey’s position as a global hub for innovation.”\nOfficials say NJ BASE will allow a business to establish itself here in the Garden State, with access to the larger U.S. market. Enterprises can then expand, attract investment and create high-quality, long-term jobs, they said.\n“New Jersey continues to strengthen its reputation as a premier destination for international companies seeking to enter the U.S. market,” said Wesley Mathews, Choose New Jersey president and CEO. “NJ BASE will provide foreign businesses with the tools, connections, and resources they need to thrive here, while further deepening New Jersey’s global partnerships and driving long-term economic growth across our state.”\nThe announcement comes on the heels of the NJEDA signing an MOU with Abu Dhabi’s Hub 71. That move aims to support technology startups seeking to expand internationally. The agreement will also complement the efforts of NJ BASE.\nNJEDA Director of International Innovation Andrew Gross noted that international companies have their eye on the Garden State. He referenced a commitment to spurring innovation, world-class educational institutions, talent pool and proximity to major cities.\n“With support from SOSA, NJ BASE will keep our state competitive and bolster our economic relationships with governments around the world,” said Gross.\nNJ BASE is slated to open in the coming months.",
