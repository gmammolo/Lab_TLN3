  "text": "There are two prime development sites with full planning permission on the market in the north Mayo and west Sligo region with a guide price of over €1 million.\nThe first of the two sites, both of which are having their sale handled by Nuala Feeney of Sherry Fitzgerald Feeney West, is located on Howley Street/Clare Street in Ballina and comes with a guide price of €1.1 million while the second is located at Pier Point, Enniscrone and has a guide price of €1,050,000.\nThe Clare St site, adjacent to the Cot and Cobble bar and restaurant, spans 1.98 acres and has full planning permission for a 91-ensuite bedroom nursing home with a communal area, kitchen and treatment rooms with an external secure landscaped garden and 33 car parking spaces. The total floor area is 4,717 square metres.\nMs Feeney told the\nthere has been a good level of interest in this site and it will attract a more specific type of developer interested in developing a nursing home project.The site is close to all amenities in Ballina and is described as offering a \"peaceful and accessible environment\" for nursing home residents.\nThe Pier Point site in Enniscrone spans 1.55 acres and is nestled along the marine front and adjoins iconic pier.\nIt has planning permission for a mixed-use development that includes eight architecturally designed semi-detached homes each with a floor space of 219.22 square metres, six upper-floor two-bedroom apartments with floor spaces ranging from 81.21 to 93.51 square metres and an additional three-bedroom apartment that is 102.34 square metres.\nIn addition, there are four commercial/retail units attached to the planning permission, each with 473 square metres of floor space.\nMs Feeney said this is a great example of a prime development site, as it is located in the middle of Enniscrone in a premier position on the Wild Atlantic Way overlooking Killala Bay and the Atlantic Ocean and there has been significant interest in the site.\nShe is hoping to see movement on the site in the new year.\nThere is one other site in Mayo with a guide price of €1.5 million located on Station Road, Castlebar comprising 3.014 acres. The site is zoned 'New Residential' in the Draft Castlebar Town and Environs Local Area Plan 2023-2029 and is located within close proximity to Castlebar Train Station and Mayo University Hospital.\nThe sale is being handled by Patrick Durcan of Sherry Fitzgerald Durcan.",
