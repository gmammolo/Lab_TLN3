  "text": "Lucky Clover 4-H September Meeting\nThe Lucky Clover 4-H meeting was called to order by Luke Tatafu and Emma Kirkland lead pledges. Reata Walden lead roll call, the question was \"What is your favorite thing about fair?\" The following members Jack Kirkland, Armita Walden, and Reata Walden all had birthdays in between August and September. The club historian Elise Kirkland talked about all the programs related to 4-H. The Lucky Clover club received a thank you card from Nashua school and one from Armita Walden. The club voted to sponsor $100 dollars to our senior graduate Jadeen Hanshew. There were over 220 names entered in the Name the Pig contest with over 500 total entries, thank you to all that participated! Some of our favorite names were Logan, Pinto Pig, Sugar, Bacon Big Mac, Kirk-a-Lakin', Burrito, Momma Bear, and Sportacus Pig.\nNational 4-H week is October 5 through 11th! Lucky Clover is doing wreath sales that will be happening right around the corner, so contact the Lucky Clover 4-H club for a wreath this year!\nA new 4-H year is upon us and the Lucky Clover club is always looking for new members, so registration began for the 2025/2026 year on Oct. 1. If interested, come join us for pizza and bowling at our next meeting on Sunday, Oct. 12, at 3 p.m. at El Cor Del bowling alley.",
