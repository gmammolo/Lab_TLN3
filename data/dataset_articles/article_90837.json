  "text": "The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), the official sponsor of Fire Prevention Week for more than 100 years, has announced “Charge into Fire Safety: Lithium-Ion Batteries in Your Home” as the theme for Fire Prevention Week, Oct. 5-11, 2025. The campaign seeks to educate the public on the safe and proper ways to buy, charge and dispose of lithium-ion batteries.\nMost home electronics such as smartphones, tablets, power and lawn tools, laptops, e-cigarettes, headphones and toys are powered by lithium-ion batteries. If not used correctly or damaged, they can overheat, start a fire or explode.",
