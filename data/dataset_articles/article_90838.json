  "text": "Submitted\nGRIFFIN — Women from across Spalding County gathered on Saturday for the Lady Parts Power Party, a free event focused on pelvic floor health and overall wellness.\nHosted by Operation M.I.S.T., the Spalding Collaborative, and Wellstar Health System’s Women’s Health service line, the session blended science, storytelling and sisterhood to address often-overlooked aspects of women’s health.\nDr. Katherine Sylvester, physical therapist and founder of Operation M.I.S.T., led a detailed overview of pelvic anatomy, scar tissue, posture, hydration and stress management.\nThe event, held at the University of Georgia Extension in Griffin, included a candid group discussion, mini consultations and a presentation of practical techniques. Attendees learned how pregnancy affects organs and how to prevent conditions like prolapse and incontinence.\n“Women’s bodies are powerful, but they’re also complex,” said Sylvester. “Care cannot be approached with a one-size-fits-all protocol. Every woman’s journey is unique, and our health education should reflect that.”\nKhristen Flennoy, director of Wellstar’s Healthy Start program, emphasized the importance of empowering women and improving maternal health outcomes through initiatives like Wellstar’s Women’s Alliance for Healthier Outcomes and partnerships with Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition of Georgia.\n“When we talk about pelvic health, we’re really talking about the foundation of women’s wellness,” said Flennoy. “Education and access are key to prevention, and events like this help women feel seen, heard and supported.”\nPart of a larger effort by Operation M.I.S.T., the Lady Parts Power Party aims to educate and uplift women through events that combine fellowship and facts.",
