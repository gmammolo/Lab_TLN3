  "text": "Eashan Kosaraju, 17, was just an eighth grader when he became interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI). So like any curious student, he set out to learn about the discipline on his own. Today, he is such an expert on AI, that he recently shared his AI knowledge with members of the Solon small business community through an online tutorial program.\n“I first self-taught myself to code in the winter of eighth grade. I later learned in the summer before my freshmen year that AI and machine learning models could be created through Python (a software program).”\nBut Eashan was not just content to learn about AI, he wanted to put it to use, so he created a project researching high blood pressure.\n“My first exposure to AI was a project where I utilized electrocardiograms to predict pulmonary hypertension, a condition where arteries in the lungs and in the heart are affected by high blood pressure.”\nHe then published a paper on the subject.\nOver the next several years, Eashan took courses through Coursera about “how generative AI such as ChatGPT can be applied to streamline business processes.”\nHe soon realized that what he had learned could be applied to all kinds of businesses. And being a dedicated student and teacher of AI, he decided to see how his knowledge could help others.\n“I had the idea of assisting local businesses with applying AI to their workflows around August of last year (2024). I then reached out to Solon Mayor Eddy Kraus, and he connected me with the City of Solon’s IT Department,” explained Eashan. “Since then, I have worked with Jim Gibbs, the city’s IT director, to develop an AI guide for small and local businesses. I wanted to keep the guide as simple as possible to ensure that it was accessible for all business owners. The guide primarily targets tasks such as creating marketing content, which previously took hours to do.”\nWith Eashan’s AI guide, small businesses can follow a step-by-step tutorial on how to use AI for their business. He highlights activities like creating business content, creating a logo, and working with legal documents and AI. The three-part tutorial is able to be accessed from the city of Solon website, or by visiting: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ9bMK_iw42E4Jt7SDbgMuWDyf9qyNJ2K.\nAccording to city of Solon IT Director Jim Gibbs, Eashan has shown continued pose and confidence even at his young age.\n“After he very confidently approached the Mayor almost a year ago talking about the benefits of AI, he and I began meeting on a semi-regular basis to discuss what benefits AI could provide to the City of Solon,” Mr. Gibbs said. “Our first goal was to showcase in very simple, nontechnical terms, how a business can utilize a tool like ChatGPT to create a business logo, create content around that logo for websites and print, and even interpret tax documents for required filings.”\nMr. Gibbs said that Eashan’s work with the city will continue beyond this first project.\n“We talked about a number of projects, some of which are still in progress but one we launched just last week. One of the projects we’ll continue discussing as Eashan has time during the school year will be, AI reading and interpreting the City’s zoning code so that residents can ask an AI bot questions of a zoning nature, such as ‘where can I build a shed on my property?’”\nThe pair have also discussed the possibility of using an AI assistant on the city’s website.\nEashan said that he sees AI as a superior kind of search tool.\n“I see AI as an improved and more efficient way of searching for information,” Eashan explained. “I don’t use AI for school as I don’t want to interfere with my individual learning process. But, I occasionally use it in my personal life. For example, if I’m searching for information on something specific, or just for articles, I may use AI to streamline my search.”\nA senior, and co student body president for Solon High School, Eashan’s talents have earned him a prestigious internship with Harvard Medical School and the Congressional Internship in 2024. He is also a Research Science Institute scholar, and serves as vice president of the City Club Youth Forum Council in Cleveland.\nEashan said he plans to continue the study of AI in college. However, going forward, he willI focus on the development of AI. “I plan to study computer science and AI in college. In the future, I hope to be on the development side of AI, working to create technology that is transparent and prioritizes public-benefit,” Eashan said.\nTo provide even more up-to-date information about AI, Eashan hosts a podcast appropriately titled “All Things AI,” which can be viewed at <https://www.youtube.com/@AllThingsAIPodcast/videos>. On this podcast, he has interviewed 50 different experts in AI. He also runs an AI literacy initiative, Empower With AI at<https://www.empowerwithai.org/>;. And has even helped the homeless through his unhoused.ai site.\n“Through all of these programs, I hope to make AI a more accessible technology for all,” said the enthusiastic high school senior.\nSo far, he is helping hundreds in his very own hometown.",
