  "text": "Golden year: OctoberTour revisits roots during 50th anniversary\nPublished 12:10 am Thursday, October 9, 2025\nJanet Briggs\nFor the last half a century, historic homes from around the Salisbury area have been on display for one weekend only, alongside refreshments and a trolley ride. The 50th OctoberTour commences on Oct. 11, with 12 historic houses in the West Square area open to the public. This year’s houses and festivities draw on the roots of the OctoberTour from the Bell Tower to familiar houses of the route from 50 years ago.\nTo celebrate the semi-centennial, the HSF moved the annual festival to Bell Tower Green instead of its usual location on Bank Street in front of the Hall House. This shift harkens back to the roots of the festival, which centered around the restoration of the Bell Tower.\nIn 1971, the former church attached to the Bell Tower was razed, leaving the tower behind in its wake. Then around 1972, the city condemned the tower and planned for it to be demolished if it was not renovated. The newly minted HSF saw the need and started trying to save the Bell Tower. It started a petition with signatures from community members to save the Bell Tower. Ultimately, the HSF worked with the bank that was leasing the property to save the tower and help pay for its renovations.\n“It was this whole big project that the whole community was rallying around. So when we were looking at this year’s OctoberTour, it felt like it was really important for us to also again rally around the Bell Tower,” Rachel Fink, the Revolving Fund project and office manager, said.\nFollowing the success of the Bell Tower renovation and other projects with the Hall house and the McKenzie-Grimes house, HSF wanted to start a Revolving Fund to continue work on other houses. OctoberTour was started in 1975 as a way to showcase the foundation’s progress and also raise funds for the new Revolving Fund. The original tour featured 10 houses in the West Square neighborhood.\nSince then, OctoberTour has become HSF’s biggest fundraising event of the year and crucial to its operations in Salisbury. As the largest event in HSF’s programming, it is a logistical challenge. With 12 houses on tour this year, there are over 300 volunteers on the schedule for this weekend’s OctoberTour with roughly 30 assigned to each site.\n“The bottom line is it always goes back to supporting our full mission. That’s what this is all about. Yes, it’s a very fun weekend for the community, and it’s a tradition that everybody looks forward to now. But it’s all about supporting our mission to save more old buildings,” said Kimberly Stieg, executive director of HSF.\nBeyond the Bell Tower, the house choices this year were meant to honor the 50th anniversary as well. The goal was to get as many of the original 1975 homes as part of the route as possible. Ultimately, four of the original houses on the 1975 tour are on this year’s route, including the Murphy-Murdoch House, Dr. Josephus W. Hall House, Charles Torrence House and Henderson Law Office.\n“We’ve taken some time to commemorate the 50 years. The houses this year are specifically houses that needed to be recognized. Most of the houses this year haven’t been on tour in a while,” Fink said.\nTicket sales for this year are well ahead of last year, and Fink estimates that the foundation has already raised over $110,000 from sponsors for this year’s event, making it the largest in OctoberTour history.\nThe festivities start on Friday night at 6:30 p.m. with the Patron’s Party hosted at the Walter-McCanless House. This party celebrates the dozens of sponsors for this year’s OctoberTour while also paying homage to the Italian Renaissance Revival architectural style of the Walter-McCanless House.\nAlso before the tours fully start, the OctoberTour Store is back for its second year. It is open at HSF on 215 Depot St. from 9 a.m. to noon on Monday, Oct. 6, to Thursday, Oct. 9. The store will also be open at Bell Tower Green during the OctoberTour hours.\nOctoberTour officially kicks off on Saturday at 10 a.m. and runs until 5 p.m. with the last tour starting at 4:30 p.m. It will also run from noon to 5 p.m. on Sunday.",
