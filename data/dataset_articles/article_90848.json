  "text": "By Staff Report ,\n13 hours ago A longtime leader in the construction industry is getting statewide recognition.\nThomas “Murph” Murphy, vice president at Power & Construction Group, was inducted into the Empire State Chapter of the Associated Builders & Contractors (ABC) Hall of Fame during the 2025 Construction Excellence Gala in Cooperstown.\nMurphy has served on the ABC Empire State Chapter’s Board of Directors and national committees, where he’s championed workforce development, apprenticeship programs, and fair competition in construction. He’s known among peers as a mentor and policy-shaper with a deep commitment to the merit shop philosophy.\n“Murph is truly one of a kind,” said Brian Sampson, president of ABC’s Empire State Chapter. “He has set the bar by which all future leaders will be measured.”\nMurphy’s next chapter is already set — he’ll take over as ABC National Board Chairman in 2026, representing nearly 23,000 members and 67 chapters. His term will coincide with the celebration of America’s 250th birthday.\nHis induction is the highest honor ABC’s Empire State Chapter bestows.",
