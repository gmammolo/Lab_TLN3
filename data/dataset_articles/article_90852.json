  "text": "BAD AXE – Gov. Gretchen Whitmer recently appointed Julienne Ferris to the Huron County Probate Court, where she will also serve as judge of the 73-B District Court.\nFerris, of Bad Axe, will fill the seat vacated by Judge David B. Herrington, who resigned earlier this year. Her partial term runs through Jan. 1, 2027.\nFerris was officially sworn in at a ceremony Oct. 8 in Huron County District Court.\n“I’m proud to appoint Julienne to the bench in Huron County,” said Whitmer in a statement. “As a skilled legal professional with a commitment to Huron County, I am confident Julienne will serve the people of Michigan admirably and uphold the rule of law.”\nFerris is a partner at Ferris, Schwedler & O’Mara, P.C. in Bad Axe, where she specializes in family and probate law. She previously practiced law in Atlanta before returning to her hometown.\nShe is also a board member for Thumb Area Transit and a past president of the Huron County Bar Association.\nThe appointment also makes Ferris the first female judge in Huron County.\n“I would like to thank Governor Whitmer for appointing me Huron County Probate Judge. It will be my honor and privilege to serve the people of Huron County,” Ferris said.\nFerris explained her excitement when she got the direct call from Whitmer about the appointment.\n“It was just an honor and a pleasure speaking with the governor,” she said.\nBorn and raised in Bad Axe, Ferris said her deep roots in the community will shape how she approaches the bench. Her father, John T. Ferris, has practiced law locally for 50 years.\n“I plan on upholding the law and the judicial system to the best of my ability and serving the people of Huron County,” she said. “But I think it’s just great that they have a female now in the government. That’s something that was needed, and it’s exciting to be part of history.”\nFerris said she is eager to work alongside Huron County Circuit Court Judge Gerald M. Prill, a former law partner who mentored her when she first began practicing law more than a decade ago.\n“It’s nice that now moving into this next step of my life as a judge, he can act as a mentor judge as well,” she said. “Together we will be able to run the courthouse smoothly and make sure all the people are served appropriately.”\nFerris also reflected on following in the footsteps of both Herrington and the late Judge Karl E. Kraus, a founding member of her father’s law firm.\n“They were such big supports to me and really fostered my love for wanting to pursue this career,” she said. “I’m grateful Judge Herrington will still be here to help as I get my feet wet, and I’ll deeply miss Judge Kraus’s friendship and wisdom.”\nFerris holds a bachelor’s degree in early childhood education from the University of Georgia and a law degree from Florida Coastal School of Law.",
