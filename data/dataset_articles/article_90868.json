  "text": "Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition Kicks Off Awareness Month Efforts with a Story of Lifesaving Advocacy!\nWILMINGTON – Breast Cancer Awareness Month is underway, and the Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition (DBCC) is putting the spotlight on the lifesaving power of self-awareness and advocacy. Breast cancer remains a pressing concern in Delaware. In 2025, an estimated 1,210 new cases will be diagnosed among Delaware residents. The state’s rates are higher than the national average, especially among underserved populations.\nThe Unexpected Connection\nAt DBCC, the mission has always been about reaching individuals with education, screenings, and support. But sometimes, chance encounters carry the biggest impact.\nThat was the case for Lissette Rivera, DBCC’s Women’s Health Screening Manager, during a visit to an imaging center earlier this year. Rivera was there to assist a scheduled patient who required interpretation services. Unable to spot her patient in the waiting room, Rivera sent a quick text: “Where are you?”\nLooking around, she noticed a young Latina woman standing alone, clearly anxiously awaiting her appointment. Rivera approached, assuming she was the patient. She wasn’t—but she was also in desperate need of interpretation services for her own upcoming appointment. The young woman’s self-breast exam led to the discovery of a lump forcing her to bravely advocate for herself to get breast cancer screening before the age of 40. Without hesitation, after learning more about her story and reason for screening Rivera offered to stay and assist this woman as well.\nTwo Appointments, Two Outcomes\nRivera’s decision led to two very different outcomes that day.\n- The scheduled patient, the reason for Rivera’s visit, received wonderful news: a clear screening.\n- The 34-year-old woman she met by chance, received devastating news: a breast cancer diagnosis.\nThat diagnosis came the very week the woman was preparing to celebrate her 35th birthday in early September.\nWhat could have been a lonely, frightening experience became a moment of compassion. DBCC, through Rivera, was there immediately to offer support and begin guiding the young woman through the next steps of treatment and survivorship care.\nThe Power of a Chance Encounter\nSince that day, DBCC has continued to walk alongside the newly diagnosed patient, helping her navigate the complexities of surgery, treatment, and the emotional toll of cancer.\n“This story is a powerful reminder,” says Lissette Rivera, “that advocating for yourself—even when it feels uncomfortable—can save lives. And when someone is willing to step in and connect you with the right resources, that support can make all the difference.”\nThe coalition encourages Delawareans to prioritize screenings and self-advocacy, and reminds the community that DBCC patient navigators are available in English, Spanish, and Haitian-Creole. To schedule a mammogram or seek support, call (302) 672-6435.\n“Get screened for breast cancer,” Rivera urges. “Early detection saves lives—one of them could be yours, or someone you love.”\nDBCC’s Statewide Role\nWith headquarters in Wilmington and offices in Kent and Sussex Counties, DBCC is the only organization providing comprehensive breast cancer support services across Delaware. Its work includes:\n- Screening & Education: Free or reduced-cost mammograms, outreach programs, and community health fairs.\n- Survivorship & Support: Peer Mentor Program linking newly diagnosed patients with survivors, plus bilingual and culturally tailored outreach.\n- Advocacy & Empowerment: Partnerships with the National Breast Cancer Coalition to push for research and an eventual end to breast cancer.\n“Our vision is to create a community where every person diagnosed with breast cancer is a survivor, and fear and doubt are replaced with knowledge and hope,” said Francesca Vogel, DBCC CEO\nCommunity Spotlight: Dewey Goes Pink\nThe state’s largest awareness event, Dewey Goes Pink, returns Saturday, October 4, drawing more than 5,000 participants to the beach for a 5K walk/run, music, and a post-race feast. Last year, the event raised $365,000, bringing its 13-year total to nearly $2 million for DBCC programs.\nOther events throughout the month include walks, golf outings, art exhibits, film screenings, and wellness gatherings—all fueling education, screenings, and survivor services year-round.\nEditor’s Fact Box: Breast Cancer Awareness in Delaware\nImpact in Delaware (2025):\n- Projected New Cases: 1,210\n- Survivors Supported by DBCC (2024): 2,594\nDBCC Services:\n- Free or reduced-cost mammograms\n- Peer Mentor Program for newly diagnosed patients\n- Bilingual and culturally tailored outreach\n- Support groups and survivorship programs\nOctober 2025 Events\nFitness & Walks\n- Dewey Goes Pink – Dewey Beach, Oct. 4 – 5K/1-Mile Fun Walk & street party\n- Pink Ribbon Walk – Seaford, Oct. 6 – Lighted path walk & ceremony at Gateway Park\n- Monster Mile Walk for a Cause – Dover International Speedway, Oct. 18 – Track walk fundraiser\n- DeerPark Goes Pink – Newark, Oct. 19 – Community walk & brunch\nArts & Expression\n- Nurture with Nature Art Exhibit & Floral Workshop – Homestead Gardens, Oct. 9 & 22\n- Wilmington International Film Festival: “FOUR MOTHERS” – Oct. 11\n- YSIA: Paint Your Own Project – The Square Rose, Oct. 23\nCelebration & Fundraisers\n- Bras for a Cause: Charting A Course Toward A Cure – Rusty Rudder, Dewey Beach, Oct. 23\n- Pink Gumbo 5 – A Night of Music and Hope – Oct. 25\n- GoPink!
