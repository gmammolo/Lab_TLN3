  "text": "EUGENE, Ore. – Oregon basketball is set to enter the 2025-26 season with high expectations as returners Nate Bittle and Jackson Shelstad were named to the Preseason All-Big Ten team.\nBittle and Shelstad both received third-team honors last season, and their recognition highlights their continued impact on a Ducks squad eager to make a deep run in the Big Ten and NCAA Tournament.\nBittle, a finalist for the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Center of the Year award last season, also earned a spot on the Big Ten All-Defensive team. He finished last season with 14.2 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks per game. His 74 total blocks led the conference, and he ranked second in blocks per game.\nShelstad started all 35 games last season for the Ducks. He contributed 13.7 points, 2.9 rebounds, and 2.7 assists per game, while shooting nearly 38% from three.\nThe West Linn native came up big in Oregon’s NCAA Tournament run, averaging 21 points on 64% shooting in two games.\nShelstad is expected to be a key offensive leader for the Ducks, although he is reportedly working through a hand injury this offseason that could affect his early preparation.\nWith both Bittle and Shelstad returning, Oregon’s frontcourt and backcourt stability provide the Ducks with a strong foundation as they aim to build on last year’s success.",
