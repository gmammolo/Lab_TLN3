  "text": "An Ithaca-based startup born from broken bones and bad supplements is now a finalist for $1 million, according to The Tompkins Weekly. Seen Nutrition, founded by Adrienne Bitar and Jennifer Han, created a caramel-like calcium chew for women after struggling to find any supplement they actually liked.\nTheir product—made from dates, almonds, milk minerals, and mushrooms—is now one of 20 global finalists in the Grow-NY food innovation competition. Winners must grow jobs in upstate New York and will be announced at the Nov. 12–13 summit.\nIf they win, the founders say the prize could fast-track hiring, expand their product line, and get Seen Nutrition into more doctor’s offices and clinics.",
