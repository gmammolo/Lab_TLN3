  "text": "Roads and Highways- 1 min read\nMandatory Biannual Inspections of bridges on National Highways to prevent accidents\nThe highways ministry is taking a strong stance on safety by requiring that agencies conduct thorough inspections of bridges and structures every six months. This initiative aims to ensure timely repairs and prevent future accidents.\nCarry out mandatory inspection of bridges and other structures on national highways twice a year - before and after monsoon, highways ministry has directed its agencies. This is crucial for determining requirement of repair and rehabilitation of structures to prevent accidents.\nIn a circular, the ministry has instructed its agencies, including NHAI and NHIDCL, that bridges and other structures must be inspected regularly at their level through independent engineers or supervision consultants as per guidelines issued by the Indian Road Congress. It said that while routine inspection of minor bridges and culverts are the responsibility of junior-level officers, in case of major bridges, this task should be carried out by senior-level engineers.\n\"Based on routine or detailed inspections, the regional office of the agencies, in consultation with project management unit or NH division, may formulate an annual programme that includes detailed examinations of specific structures, as well as plans for their repair, rehabilitation or replacement,\" the circular said.\nCongress MP and spokesman Shaktisinh Gohil said the bridge in Vadodara was renovated at a huge cost just before its collapse, adding that locals including political persons had complained to the govt that it was shaking and needed repair. He claimed the bridge collapse just after the renovation is result of a culture in the state where the contractors awarded the bid for the lowest tender have to pay commission at the BJP office, which results in compromise in the quality of work executed.>\nIn a circular, the ministry has instructed its agencies, including NHAI and NHIDCL, that bridges and other structures must be inspected regularly at their level through independent engineers or supervision consultants as per guidelines issued by the Indian Road Congress.
