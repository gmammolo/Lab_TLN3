  "text": "One day. Over 600 nonprofits. Countless lives changed.\nROC the Day, the annual online giving event powered by United Way of Greater Rochester and the Finger Lakes, returns Tuesday, December 2. The 24-hour fundraiser gives people across the region a chance to support causes they care about with one simple online donation.\nFrom health and human services to education, the arts, animals, and the environment, the ROCtheDay.org catalog makes it easy to browse and give.\n“Giving on ROC the Day is easy—but the impact lasts all year,” said Erin Bombard, United Way’s director of marketing and communications. “These 24 hours prove that when we all give a little, we can change a lot.”\nLast year, the community raised nearly $1 million through more than 6,800 donations. This year’s goal: even more generosity.\nHow to participate:\n- When: Tuesday, December 2, 2025\n- Where:\nwww.ROCtheDay.org - Who: Anyone who wants to support local nonprofits\nUnited Way is encouraging residents to mark their calendars, spread the word, and help make a difference in just one day.",
