  "text": "A warm meal, a welcoming table, and a reminder that no one has to spend Thanksgiving alone — that’s what’s on offer at this year’s Community Thanksgiving Dinner in Seneca County.\nNow in its 10th year, the free dinner is a joint effort by the Seneca County House of Concern, Elks Lodge #992, and the United Way of Seneca County. Anyone in the community can stop in, pick up a meal, or have one delivered — no questions asked.\nThree ways to take part\nFolks can enjoy a full Thanksgiving buffet in person at Elks Lodge #992 on Thanksgiving Day. No reservations are needed — just walk in and grab a plate.\nPrefer to stay home? Meals can also be picked up or delivered the day before the holiday, on Wednesday, November 26. Pickups run from 4 to 5:30 p.m., and deliveries go out from 2 to 4 p.m. Anyone in Seneca County can register for either option by calling (315) 568-2433.\nVolunteers and donations welcome\nIt takes a lot of hands to serve hundreds of meals. Organizers say volunteers are needed to prep, serve, and deliver food — and all ages are welcome. Anyone interested can sign up at www.uwseneca.org or email [[email protected]].\nDonations are also welcome. Contributions can be made online at www.houseofconcern.org or by mailing a check to the Seneca County House of Concern, 22 Locust Street, Waterloo 13165. Be sure to note that it’s for the Thanksgiving dinner.\n“This dinner is about more than food — it’s about community,” said Rhonda Jasper, Executive Director of United Way of Seneca County. “It’s about making sure everyone feels connected and cared for — whether they join us in person, receive a delivery, or volunteer to help make it happen.”",
