We don’t like that they take lives and destroy property, so we’re doing our best to absolutely be trained. We’re so fortunate that the city gives us the best equipment we can have for our 65 dedicated volunteers who come through.”\nThe annual banquet and presentation of the queen and her court at Pearce Memorial Park Community House highlighted the department’s longstanding commitment to fire safety while celebrating the young women who represent the department’s families and its values.\nQueen Alyssa Smith of Jackson High School headlines a court which includes Madison Sims of Jackson High, Ellie Busby of Leroy High, Ivy Criswell of Jackson Academy, Emilia McDonald of Jackson High and Callie Childs of Clarke Prep.\nThe JFD hosted its annual Fire Prevention Ladies Tea on Sunday, welcoming more than 150 attendees, including the queen and her court, firefighters’ wives, significant others and daughters. The group also attended church together, continuing a tradition of unity that has long marked the start of Fire Prevention Week in Jackson.\nBrown said Fire Prevention Week is the most important time of the year for his department.\n“This is my life,” he said. “Apart from my paying job, this takes up a lot of time but it is a labor of responsibility. We don’t want anyone to be hurt or experience a fire loss. That’s why it started back in the 1600s with bellringers and door knockers. We’ve been so fortunate in our area because we can’t remember the last time we had a fire death in the city limits of Jackson.”\nThe JFD continued its outreach Wednesday with school visits promoting fire safety and the annual Fire Prevention Parade, which began at 3:30 p.m. after local schools dismissed early for the event.\nThe celebration also served as a moment of reflection on the program’s history. Brown noted that Chief George Skipper started Fire Prevention Week in Jackson in 1950 and the first Fire Prevention queen was crowned in 1960.\n“This week coincides with the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, when the whole city burned,” Brown said. “Over 300 people died and that tragedy led to the fire codes and prevention efforts we still build on today.” Photo by By Logan Gatlin",
