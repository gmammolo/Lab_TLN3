  "text": "Blockchain data confirms a growing trend among Solana (SOL) holders as thousands move to back emerging PayFi altcoin Remittix (RTX). Over 40,000 investors have already joined the Remittix ICO, drawn by its real-world crypto-to-fiat payment utility. As SOL investors pivot to this fast-growing project, analysts believe Remittix might be the next big player to redefine the global PayFi space.\nSolana Price Today Shows Steady Momentum Amid Institutional Demand\nSolana (SOL) remains in the spotlight of investors as recent statistics are suggesting rising adoption of the network and increasing institutional confidence. The SOL price today sits around $236, supported by strong inflows into Solana-based investment products, which have now reached a record $5.1 billion in total assets under management. This milestone reinforces Solana’s position as one of the most in-demand altcoins of 2025.\nAnalysts monitoring Solana news observe that the biggest issuers, including Grayscale, Bitwise and VanEck, are aggressively lobbying the U.S. to approve SOL ETFs, and that many filings now have staking capabilities to further reward investors. It has been driving the bullish trend. It has also led analysts to predict that SOL price will hit $500 early next year if the trend continues.\nOn-chain data also shows that there has been a slow but steady growth in both the DeFi and NFT ecosystems on Solana. Solana price has been showing resilience even amid broader market pullbacks. This just proves that institutional adoption and strong fundamentals are sustaining the rally.\nExperts Predict Remittix Could Lead The PayFi Revolution\nThe buzz surrounding Remittix (RTX) has caught fire across the crypto community, with Solana (SOL) holders leading the charge as more than 40,000 investors join the ICO. Unlike speculative hype-driven launches, Remittix stands out for its real-world use case: bridging crypto and fiat payments instantly.\nExperts are calling it one of the most promising altcoins to emerge from the PayFi sector, giving crypto users a faster, cheaper, and borderless way to send and receive funds globally. This has sparked major traction among Solana investors looking to diversify into a project with true payment utility.\n- Over 40,000 users have already joined the Remittix ICO\n- $27.2 million raised and more than 676 million tokens sold\n- Beta testing for the Remittix wallet is now live\n- 15% USDT referral reward claimable every 24 hours through the dashboard\nThe Remittix wallet lets users convert crypto to fiat in seconds and send directly to any bank worldwide, a game-changer for freelancers and businesses alike. With BitMart and LBank confirmed as the first CEX listings, Remittix is set to enter the next stage of adoption. For SOL investors watching PayFi innovation unfold, RTX could be the next breakout success story of 2025.\nDiscover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here:\nWebsite: https://remittix.io/\nSocials: https://linktr.ee/remittix\n$250K Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway\nDisclaimer: This media platform provides the content of this article on an \"as-is\" basis, without any warranties or representations of any kind, express or implied.
