  "text": "By Bailey Allen Melina Khan ,\n12 days ago Amazon has agreed to refund up to $1.5 billion to customers after the company was accused of \"deceptively\" enrolling users in Prime subscriptions and making it difficult to cancel, according to the Federal Trade Commission .\nThe FTC said on Sept. 25 that it had charged Amazon and several executives with knowingly misleading millions of shoppers into signing up for the Prime program, and that documents revealed employees discussed such tricky tactics.\nBesides paying back $1.5 billion to customers, Amazon will have to pay a $1 billion civil penalty and make several changes to the Prime enrollment and cancellation processes, the FTC said.\nThe embattled e-commerce company, founded by Jeff Bezos, released a statement Thursday saying Amazon has \"always followed the law.\"\n\"We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world,\" Amazon said. \"We will continue to do so, and look forward to what we’ll deliver for Prime members in the coming years.\"\nHere's what to know about getting a payment from the Amazon settlement.\nWho's eligible for payment in the Amazon FTC settlement? According to the court order , certain Amazon customers who signed up for Prime between June 23, 2019 and June 23, 2025 are eligible for a settlement payment.\nHowever, the customers are only eligible for the settlement if they unsuccessfully tried to cancel their Prime subscription, or if they signed up for Prime through what documents called a \"challenged enrollment flow.\"\nThe so-called \"challenged\" flow means any subscription that was signed up for through certain pages on Amazon's website, including the \"Universal Prime Decision Page, the Shipping Option Select Page, Prime Video enrollment flow, or the Single Page Checkout,\" per the court order.\nHow Prime customers can claim their refunds There are two ways eligible Prime customers can receive payouts – automatically or through a claims process, the FTC said in the order . There are different criteria for each:\nAutomatic payments: The first wave of payments will be distributed through an automatic payout over the next 90 days. Only customers who enrolled through the \"challenged enrollment flow\" and used their Prime benefits three or fewer times over any 12-month period of enrollment will receive an automatic payment. This group of customers does not need to submit a claim to get paid. It's unclear exactly how these payments will be issued. Filing claims: Under the second wave, customers will have to submit a claim to receive payment. Claimants are eligible for this group if they were enrolled through the \"challenged enrollment flow\" and/or unsuccessfully tried to cancel their subscription, and used Prime benefits less than ten times over any 12-month period of enrollment. Within 30 days of completing the automatic payouts, Amazon will be required to send out claims forms to eligible customers. After that, eligible customers will have 180 days to submit the form. Those who already received automatic payments cannot file a claim. How much money can eligible customers get from the Amazon settlement? Customers who are eligible for cash as part of the settlement — in either wave of payouts — will be paid a maximum of $51 dollars each, the court order said .\nThe amount each customer gets will be based on the total amount of Amazon Prime membership fees paid during the duration of their subscription.\nAmazon ordered to make Prime enrollment, cancellation processes clearer Amazon is also required to make its Prime enrollment and cancellation processes more transparent, according to the FTC.\nThe company is required to include a clear and conspicuous button for customers to decline Prime, and can no longer have buttons that say, \"No thanks, I don't want free shipping.\"\nAmazon is also required to disclose the cost, date, and frequency of Prime charges to customers, as well as whether the subscription auto-renews and how to cancel it.\nThe cancellation process must be \"easy,\" the FTC said, and must be available using the same method customers used to sign up for Prime.\nA third-party supervisor will monitor Amazon's compliance, according to the FTC.\nMary Walrath-Holdridge, Jessica Guynn, and Bailey Schulz of USA TODAY contributed to this report.\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: Amazon to refund select Prime customers in FTC settlement.
