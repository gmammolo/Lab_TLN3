Check out viral post below!\nA simple chat between woman and her house help has turned into one of the most viral conversations on X (formerly Twitter) this week. The post, which details how a domestic worker in Surat bought a Rs 60-lakh 3BHK flat, has stunned and fascinated social media users alike.\nThe user wrote, “My house help came in today looking really happy. She told me she just bought a 3BHK flat in Surat worth ₹60 lakhs, spent ₹4 lakh on furniture and took only a ₹10 lakh loan. I was honestly shocked. When I asked more, she mentioned that she already owns a two-floor house and a shop in the nearby Velanja village, both on rent. I just sat there speechless.”\nShe added, “I am happy for her, of course! But as a society, we’ve built this mindset that people in such jobs are poor. In reality, they’re much smarter with money. While we spend on cafes, phones, expensive things, and trips, they save and manage wisely.”\nThe post quickly went viral, sparking hundreds of comments and discussions about how someone in a domestic job managed to build such a strong financial portfolio. While some netizens applauded her for her discipline and foresight, others pointed to the advantages of India’s informal, largely untaxed cash economy.\nMy house help came in today looking really happy.

Over time, this allows them to save more and build assets faster than us.”\nA third user wondered, “So you get 3 bhk in 60 lacs.” A tweet read, “You remove education fees, income tax, healthcare cost, and expensive cafe and restaurants, India is damn cheap. Almost 4 people earn in their house. They can easily earn 60-70k or even 90k per month. If they save 50-60k every month, it is possible.” Yet another user posted, “Househelp ke yahan bhi koi househelp aati hogi.”\nHowever, others defended the woman’s success as a result of smart saving and perseverance. “She probably saved every rupee she earned and invested wisely in property early. That’s called financial planning, not privilege,” one person commented. Another wrote, “This is truly an inspirational example of hard work, smart savings, and astute investment! The fact that she bought a ₹60 lakh flat with only a ₹10 lakh loan demonstrates immense financial discipline. Already owning and renting out a two-floor house and a shop shows a clear and powerful strategy for generating stable passive income. Her achievement is a testament to the power of smart financial planning and foresight.”\nOne user aptly summed it up, “Taxed or untaxed, hustle is hustle.”\nClick for more latest Viral news.
