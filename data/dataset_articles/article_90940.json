  "text": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with US President Donald Trump following the signing of the historic agreement for the release of all hostages , the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said in a post on X on Thursday. According to the statement, the two leaders had a “very emotional and warm conversation,\" congratulating each other on what both described as a landmark achievement. Netanyahu thanked Trump for his “efforts and global leadership,\" while Trump praised Netanyahu for his “determined leadership and the actions he led\" in securing the deal. The post added that both leaders agreed to continue their close cooperation, and that Prime Minister Netanyahu invited President Trump to address the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, in the near future.

The deal, set to be formally signed Thursday, includes the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and the delivery of large-scale humanitarian aid to Gaza. The war erupted after Hamas’s unprecedented October 2023 attack on Israel, which left the region engulfed in violence for over two years. US President Donald Trump announced the breakthrough following talks in Egypt as part of his 20-point peace plan, saying that under the agreement, Hamas will release all hostages, while Israel will withdraw its forces to a mutually agreed line. Also Read: Israel, Hamas Agree To First Phase Of ‘Historic’ Gaza Peace Deal, Hostage Release: Trump A Hamas source told AFP that the group will exchange 20 living hostages for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first phase, which is expected to take place within 72 hours of the deal’s implementation. The swap reportedly includes 250 prisoners serving life terms and 1,700 others detained since the start of the war. Trump said he believed all the hostages would “be coming back on Monday,\" adding that the United States will assist in rebuilding Gaza and ensuring that it remains “safe and peaceful.\" Qatar, which played a key mediating role, said the agreement represents “the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire,\" leading to an end to the war, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of vital humanitarian aid into the devastated enclave.",
