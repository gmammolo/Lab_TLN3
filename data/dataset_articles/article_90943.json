  "text": "By Josiah Elmore ,\n1 hours ago\nSOMERVILLE, Ala. ( WHNT ) — Friday night’s win over Scottsboro was a big win for the Brewer Patriots in multiple ways.\nIt was the team’s second win of the year and their second win ever over the Wildcats, a team that hadn’t lost a region game at home since 2021, was ranked in the top 10 in 5A and was celebrating homecoming.\n🏈Football Friday – Your one stop shop for all things Tennessee Valley high school football!

It was a great feeling, you know just to go out there and get a win, first get a win, get us out of that losing streak, and then to beat Scottsboro on their home field on their homecoming, that was just great,” Drinkard said.\nBrewer currently sits in fifth place in Class 5A Region 8, and while the Patriots have some work to do to get a top-four seed in the region, the win gives them life for a playoff berth.\n“It was just an eye opener for them again, just to show that hey, the losses we learn from them, we have the potential, and let’s move forward, and we don’t know where it’s going to lead us, it could lead us in a thousand different ways,” Miller said. “We are just going to game by game, day by day, and see where we end up at the end of the season.”\nBrewer hosts Boaz Friday night as they look to make it two straight wins.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
