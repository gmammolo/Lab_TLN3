  "text": "The Allan Labor Government is providing more support to students with disabilities and their families, expanding the outside school hours' care (OSHC) services at Victoria's specialist schools.\nDeputy Premier and Minister for Education Ben Carroll today announced six new High Intensity OSHC services will commence operation in 2026 - giving hundreds of families across Victoria the extra support they deserve.\nThe new services will now operate at Ascot Vale Heights School, Ashwood School, Niddrie Autistic School, Peninsula Specialist College, Port Phillip Specialist School and Marra School, a new school which opens its doors for the first time next year.\nHigh Intensity OSHC is a Labor Government initiative providing free, tailored care for children with disabilities who attend specialist schools, offering high educator-to-child ratios and enriching activities.\nThis latest funding boost will also ensure that appropriately qualified staff are on hand to meet children's needs, including making sure they're safe, delivering engaging activities in line with their interests, and supporting learning and socialisation with their peers.\nThe OSHC was initially established in response to feedback from specialist school families, who highlighted a gap in the access of affordable care programs before and after school, as well as during holidays, that adequately met their children's support needs - listing it as one of their most pressing concerns.\nStarting as a pilot program at five specialist schools in 2018, the results demonstrated substantial improvements in students' academic outcomes, and better wellbeing for both children and their families - with 92 per cent of parents or carers indicating they had either already pursued additional work or training or were planning to do so.\nThis year's expansion adds to the 25 services already operating, delivering on a commitment to build on the pilot program.\nThe Labor Government has a strong track record of supporting students with additional needs attending mainstream educational facilities, delivering nearly $1.9 billion in Disability Inclusion measures across the state.\nAs stated by Deputy Premier and Minister for Education Ben Carroll\n\"Finding specialised outside school hours care can be tough for families, so we are ensuring students with disability have access to free care close to home - meaning busy parents and carers can focus on work or study.\"\n\"By expanding these services across specialist schools, we're making sure every student gets the support they need to thrive while giving parents the peace of mind that their child is well taken care of.\"\nhere.",
