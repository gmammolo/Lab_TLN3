  "text": "Daijiworld Media Network – New Delhi\nNew Delhi, Oct 9: In a major step towards combating organised crime, the Delhi Police is preparing to establish a specialised unit under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) to intensify action against gangsters and criminal syndicates operating across the national capital and neighbouring states, sources said on Wednesday.\nAccording to senior police officials, the proposed unit will be equipped with advanced forensic tools and cybercrime expertise to strengthen investigations and streamline coordination among law enforcement agencies.\n“The unit has become necessary due to the increasing number of gangsters and the changing patterns of organised crime in the region,” a police source said, adding that the initiative aims to target networks running extortion, contract killings, and criminal rackets both within and outside the city.\nThe specialised unit will function in close coordination with the Crime Branch and the Special Cell, which will provide technical and operational support. The initial strength of the unit is expected to be around 100 trained personnel.\nPreliminary discussions have already begun to define the structure and operational strategy of the team. “It will primarily deal with gangs, foreign-based criminals, extortion rackets being operated from jails, gang rivalries, and organised syndicates active in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan,” the source added.\nThe new unit will also work in collaboration with police forces of adjoining states to carry out joint operations against cross-border criminal activities.\nThe Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), 1999—a stringent law originally enacted to tackle organised crime and terrorism—provides special provisions for the prevention and control of such offences. The enforcement of this law in the national capital is expected to give Delhi Police greater authority to dismantle deep-rooted criminal networks operating across the northern region.",
