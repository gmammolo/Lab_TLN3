  "text": "Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) leader and actor-turned-politician Vijay spoke to families of the September 27 Karur stampede victims via video call. In a now-viral clip, a party worker can be seen connecting Vijay with a grieving family, highlighting his personal outreach amid the ongoing tragedy. The Karur stampede occurred during a TVK rally ahead of Tamil Nadu’s 2026 elections. Over 41 people lost their lives, including minors and more than 100 were injured when thousands surged towards Vijay’s convoy after his delayed arrival. The venue, intended for 2,000-3,000 attendees, was overcrowded with over 30,000 supporters. Many victims were trampled or fell into open drains as chaos erupted under hot weather, power outages, and lack of basic amenities. Heartbreaking accounts included families losing multiple members, intensifying public grief and scrutiny. Authorities have criticised TVK organisers for crowd mismanagement and failing to follow police guidance. FIRs were filed against several party officials, although Vijay was not named in any criminal complaints. Political leaders across the spectrum expressed condolences and announced compensation packages for the victims’ families. In response to the tragedy, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin established a one-member commission led by retired judge Aruna Jagadeesan to conduct an independent inquiry. Meanwhile, the Madras High Court constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the incident, criticising TVK for inadequate safety measures. TVK has challenged the High Court’s order in the Supreme Court, requesting an impartial probe into the circumstances surrounding the stampede. The Karur tragedy continues to influence Tamil Nadu’s political discourse ahead of the 2026 assembly election.",
