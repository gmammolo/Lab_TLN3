  "text": "IAS officer Sanskriti Jain received an elaborate send-off from her staff and colleagues as she concluded her tenure as Collector of Seoni district, Madhya Pradesh. The farewell, held as part of a formal handover to the incoming Collector Sheetala Patle, drew attention for its distinctive gesture — Jain was carried on a gold-coloured palanquin during the event. Footage shared on social media showed the officer seated on the decorated palanquin, holding a bouquet, with her two daughters beside her. Once she was comfortably seated, several staff members lifted and carried the palanquin amid claps and background music. The ceremony marked the end of her term in Seoni and her transition to a new administrative role in the state capital. Jain has now taken charge as Commissioner of the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC), in addition to her new responsibility as Additional Managing Director of the Madhya Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation Limited. ! pic.twitter.com/fSMmIorN7Y — Rupesh Mishra (@rupeshmishramp) October 5, 2025 Born on February 14, 1989 in Srinagar, Jain grew up in a family associated with public service — her father served as a fighter pilot in the Indian Air Force, while her mother worked in its medical services wing. Owing to frequent transfers, she attended six different schools across the country before completing her undergraduate degree from BITS Pilani, Goa campus. A former LAMP Fellow, Jain had originally intended to pursue a PhD but decided to prepare for the Civil Services Examination on the recommendation of a friend. She cleared the exam on her first attempt, joined the Indian Revenue Service on her second, and entered the Indian Administrative Service in her third attempt, securing an All India Rank of 11 in 2014. According to educational sources, she also achieved the highest marks in Philosophy, her optional subject that year.\",",
