  "text": "United Church of Marco Island will host a Ministry Fair on Sunday, October 12, immediately following the 10:00 AM worship service. The celebration will also include the reception of nine new members into the fellowship of the church during the morning service.\n“United Church of Marco Island welcomes people to explore and live out their faith where God might be calling them,” said Pastor Ed Brandt. “The Ministry Fair is a way of showcasing and inviting members to be part of United Church’s work and ministry—locally and beyond.”\nFollowing worship, the Ministry Fair will feature displays and representatives from a variety of church ministries and mission partners, giving attendees an opportunity to discover ways to serve, volunteer, and deepen their involvement in faith and community life.\n“We are also thrilled to welcome nine new members to the fellowship of the church and look forward to expanding the church’s reach in the community,” Pastor Brandt added.\nUnited Church of Marco Island gathers for worship at 10:00 AM(Classic Service).
