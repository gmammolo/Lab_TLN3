  "text": "Scooters Drive TVS Motor’s 12% YoY Growth in September Sales\nDomestic two-wheeler sales grew 12% to 4.13 lakh units, while exports rose 8% to 1.11 lakh units.\nTVS Motor Company has reported robust sales for September 2025, crossing the 5.41 lakh unit mark, reflecting a 12% growth compared to 4.82 lakh units sold in September 2024. The strong performance marks a continuation of the company’s upward trajectory, following its record-breaking August sales of 5.09 lakh units, which itself represented a significant 30% growth over August 2024.\nTwo-Wheeler Sales: Scooters Leading the Charge\nThe company’s two-wheeler segment accounted for 5.24 lakh units in September, up 11% from 4.72 lakh units a year ago. Domestic two-wheeler sales grew 12% to 4.13 lakh units, while exports rose 8% to 1.11 lakh units. Within the segment, scooters emerged as the primary growth driver, posting a 17% increase to 2.19 lakh units, outpacing motorcycles, which grew 9% to 2.50 lakh units. This trend underscores the shift in consumer preference toward urban mobility solutions, a pattern first highlighted in August when scooters slightly edged out motorcycles in sales.\nThree-Wheeler and EV Sales\nThree-wheelers saw a substantial surge of 60% year-on-year, with 17,141 units sold in September 2025, reflecting a strong recovery in the commercial mobility segment. Electric vehicle sales rose 8% to 31,266 units, though production continues to face challenges due to magnet supply constraints, limiting faster growth.\nExports Continue to Drive Global Expansion\nTVS Motor’s international business contributed 1.22 lakh units, a 10% increase over September 2024. Two-wheeler exports grew 8% to 1.11 lakh units, demonstrating the company’s steady expansion in overseas markets despite global competitive pressures.\nThe September numbers contributed to TVS Motor achieving its highest-ever quarterly sales of 15.07 lakh units in Q2FY26, a 22% rise from 12.28 lakh units in Q2FY25. Two-wheeler sales accounted for 14.54 lakh units, while three-wheelers contributed 0.53 lakh units. Total exports grew 30% to 4.00 lakh units during the quarter.\nIndustry analysts note that TVS Motor’s momentum is especially notable in the scooter segment, reflecting the broader trend of urban consumers favoring convenience and fuel efficiency. Compared to peers, TVS’s August and September performance highlights its growing domestic and international footprint, positioning it as a key competitor in India’s evolving two- and three-wheeler market.\nRELATED ARTICLES\nHala Mobility Raises ₹30 Crores Through Franchise Model to Expand EV Fleet\nThe company raises ₹30 crore via its franchise model to scale its EV fleet to 6,000 vehicles, empowering micro-entrepren...\nMaruti Suzuki Inaugurates 5,000th ARENA Service Touchpoint in Coimbatore\nThe company hits 5,000 ARENA service touchpoints with new Coimbatore facility, expanding its nationwide network to over ...\nLilypad and Battery Smart Partner to Boost EV Adoption in Delhi NCR\nThe two companies team up in Delhi NCR to drive EV adoption with battery-less e-scooters and swapping infrastructure, ta...",
