  "text": "Virginia Tech Experts Spotlight Research, Issues for World Mental Health Day\nNewswise — World Mental Health Day, observed annually on Oct. 10, raises global awareness of mental health issues and mobilizes efforts to support mental health care. The day gives all stakeholders who work on mental health issues a chance to talk about their work and discuss what needs to happen to make mental health care a reality for people worldwide\nVirginia Tech experts Wynn Legon, assistant professor at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC, and Adrienne Means-Christensen, director of the Psychological Services Center at Virginia Tech, can discuss mental health research and issues.\nWynn Legon on noninvasive brain research for anxiety\nLegon and his research team are testing whether focused ultrasound can reduce anxiety. “Our early human studies suggest that brief, well-timed ultrasound sessions can temporarily dial down the brain’s alarm response and reduce anxiety-related brain activity and physiology, such as heart rate, that translates to people reporting reduced anxiety,” he said.\n“The treatment uses low-intensity focused ultrasound, which directs harmless sound waves to precise points in the brain. It’s like using a magnifying glass with sound instead of light,” he said. “There’s no incision, no radiation, and sessions take minutes while the person is awake. Focused ultrasound has turned brain surgery into day surgery — but without the surgery.”\n“We’re not setting out to treat anxiety the way a therapist would,” Legon explained. “We’re modulating the precise networks in a particular patient that make uncertainty feel threatening.”\n“We’re also learning how dose and targeting matter. Small changes in where and how we deliver ultrasound to the brain can produce meaningfully different effects. In practice, treatment involves sitting in a chair, receiving the session, and walking out the same day,” he said.\n“We’re in early clinical testing now for indications like chronic pain and anxiety,” Legon said. “If trials continue to show benefit and safety, the next step is larger, multi-site studies and U.S. Food and Drug Administration review.”\nAdrienne Means-Christensen on chronic stress vs. depression\n“Chronic stress takes a significant physical and psychological toll. When the sympathetic nervous system stays ‘turned on,’ it can wear down the body and mind,” Means-Christensen said. “Chronic stress depletes our resources as our bodies go through the stages of dealing with it. During the final stage, the exhaustion phase, several things occur that look a lot like depressive symptoms.”\n“Those symptoms can include fatigue, trouble concentrating and remembering, changes in sleep or appetite, and low motivation — which are all symptoms of depression,” she said. “People under chronic stress often neglect basic self-care, which can worsen mood and cognitive function.”\n“For a true diagnosis of depression, the feeling of being depressed — what we think of as being down, depressed, or blue — or a true loss of enjoyment in things, independent of fatigue, time, or energy, are really essential. If people don’t have one of those two symptoms, it may be a good idea to look at stress,” she said. “If you’re unsure, check basics like sleep, nutrition and social engagement.”\nMeans-Christensen added that a mental health professional can help determine the right approach. “Stress may improve with lifestyle changes, while depression often requires therapy or medication,” she said.\nAbout Legon\nWynn Legon is an assistant professor at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC and in the School of Neuroscience at Virginia Tech. His research explores how low-intensity focused ultrasound, a noninvasive form of brain stimulation, could help reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression and addiction.

She provides clinical insight on how chronic stress can mirror depression and offers guidance on steps people can take to improve their mental health.
