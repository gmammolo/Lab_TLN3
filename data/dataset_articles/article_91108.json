  "text": "The relative acceptance of the transgender community in modern society didn’t happen until recently. Even though strides have been made to make America a welcoming place for trans people, the U.S. government has taken unprecedented steps to erase that progress.\nAround the world, gender expression has been celebrated throughout history. Ancient Mesopotamians worshipped Inanna, otherwise known as Ishtar. She was known as the Queen of Heaven and the Goddess of sex, war and justice. Inanna was also believed to have the power to change a person’s gender.\nIn the 23rd century B.C., Inanna’s High Priestess in the city of Ur, Enheduanna, wrote, “To turn a man into a woman and a woman into a man are yours, Inana.”\nAlthough the exact translation has never been confirmed, it is theorized to relate to gender stereotypes and has been used as evidence to prove people have always lived outside the binary lines.\nHowever, sometime between now and then, the historical respect and acknowledgment of anyone living outside of the gender binary has disappeared.\nIn the 1950s, a U.S. Army veteran, Christine Jorgensen, made history as the first American to undergo gender-affirming surgery. Jorgensen sent a letter to her family after receiving the surgery in Denmark, saying, “Nature made a mistake, which I have had corrected, and I am now your daughter.” Jorgensen quickly became famous for her revolutionary change. She went from a U.S. Army soldier to a polished, refined and feminine woman.\nWhen Jorgensen came out, the word “transgender” didn’t exist yet, and wouldn’t come to exist for another roughly 30 years. Her bravery allowed a light to shine on the transgender community, which was previously living in the shadows.\nIn the late 1950s into the 1960s, a revolution began as a result of violence toward trans people from the police. In 1969, the movement reached a breaking point when the police attempted a raid on the Stonewall Inn. Activists, one being Marsha P. Johnson, fought back, causing an uproar leading to the LGBTQIA+ civil rights movement of the 1970s.\nAlthough trans people helped lead the charge to LGBTQIA+ civil rights, they were still discriminated against within the community as a whole at a time when trans people were banned from speaking at Pride events.\nWithin the past 10 years, intolerance for trans people has begun to rise again, with new bills banning gender-affirming care and the use of bathrooms that align with gender identity for minors. Following the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who frequently spoke negatively of the trans community, the conservative party has begun to label trans people as violent and nihilistic, further fueling an already heightened political environment.\nThe Trump administration has taken strides to erase trans history on government websites and has been aimlessly targeting trans people to explain the increase in violence.\nIn 2025 alone, 999 anti-trans bills have been introduced in 49 states in the U.S., 122 of which have passed. Before the year is even over, state governments have successfully passed over double the number of anti-trans bills as in 2024, which saw 51 bills passed. Additionally, in 2023, the Human Rights Campaign declared a National State of Emergency for LGBTQIA+ Americans. The HRC had never done this before.\nThe hatred of trans people in our country has pushed me to question our government in ways I never have before. We, as Americans, are forced to listen and comply with the bigotry that comes from the top offices in our country.\nWhen the homelessness rates are spiking, and food prices are rising faster than the average rate of growth, why does the government want us to focus on trans people? Why should we care about trans people getting the care they need when roughly a third of U.S. adults have reported avoiding necessary healthcare visits due to the cost?\nIt is blatantly clear the finger being pointed at trans people has absolutely nothing to do with trans people and everything to do with the discomfort trans people bring the average conservative American. Our country has done irreparable damage to the trust and security LGBTQIA+ people once had in America.\nAlaina Sayre is a sophomore studying journalism at Ohio University.
