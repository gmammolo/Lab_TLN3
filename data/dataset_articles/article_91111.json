  "text": "Oct. 6 was the last day to register to vote in the November general election in Ohio. Not every election is about who leads from the White House, but votes still matter, even for the seemingly smaller elections. The positions and issues people vote on in local and state elections have a significant impact on communities. The Ohio general election is Nov. 4, and practicing the right to vote is important, whether it is at the local, state or federal level.\nActively voting is one way to keep you registered. Some states have laws that require individuals to update their registration within a certain timeframe, after which they are removed from the registration lists. Ohio is one of these states. Updating any new information, like your home address if you’ve moved, is essential. You can check your registration status and see if everything is updated on Ohio’s voting website.\nLocal elections affect your homes and those close to you. They affect how much is spent and where priorities lie. In this Ohio general election, local issues are on the counties’ ballots. The people in the local office are the ones who will decide what’s fixed and how your community functions. As the state and federal officials work to bring money in, local officials help assist in deciding where it goes and who it goes to.\nLocal officials are people you can actually be in closer contact with, rather than higher political public figures who are difficult to reach. School board members decide how the school system runs and where funds go. Municipal positions serve the community. The city council can decide on more policy-focused issues. Politicians are still politicians, and choosing the right ones is possible, so choose the ones who want your voices heard and the best for the community.\nIn Athens, the ballot consists of city and school positions as well as tax issues. City Council members are the people who hear issues covering zoning, the environment, infrastructure and fiscal policies. The issues they cover affect small businesses, students at Ohio University and every Athens citizen. The city council listens to the Athens community and is in contact with the mayor. This is an opportunity to see and potentially change the layout of who represents Athens to a close-knit degree. City council even has public meetings and records them as well, if one wants references on all that they do.\nThe United States is built on the fact that states decide much of their own paths, and voting at a local level is the cornerstone of that. Choosing those you want at the local levels provides a stronger voice toward those in the larger positions. It has the potential to boost communities and provide them with greater opportunities.\nOverall, voting is important, and it is a right that some weren’t given for a long time. The government is in a state of uncertainty right now, and many live in constant fear. Practice what consistency the U.S. still has and place who you want in office this time around, even if it's at a local level.\nKyra Dapore is a senior studying journalism at Ohio University.
