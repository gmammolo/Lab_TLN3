  "text": "Wednesday’s Child - Eidde\nTOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - In this week’s Wednesday’s Child, we’re introducing you to 7-year-old Eidde, whose laughter echoes in the open air, but his heart longs for a place to belong and a loving family to call home!\n7-year-old Eidde is an outgoing bundle of energy who loves to make people laugh.\nWe caught up with him at the Popcorn Factory in Wichita, where he got first-hand experience making birthday cake popcorn.\nBesides being a team player and a great worker, he loves to be outside.\nHe enjoys playing sports, riding his scooter, or just simply exploring.\nIn his free time, you can find Eidde doing arts and crafts.\nSome may say Eidde is also a dream child because he actually enjoys doing chores.\nWhen Eidde grows up, he says he wants to be a police officer.\nEidde will need a patient family who can provide him with structure and supervision, a family to call his own, a family who will love and care for him.\nFor more information about Eidde or any of the other kids in need of adoption, go to adoptkskids.org.\nCopyright 2025 WIBW.
