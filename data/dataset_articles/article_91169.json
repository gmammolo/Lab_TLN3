  "text": "By Sandy Torres ,\n2 hours ago\nMcAllen, Texas ( ValleyCentral ) – Dozens of people gathered Wednesday morning to celebrate The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley’s most recent medical milestone.\nUT Health Rio Grande Valley Cancer and Surgery Center is a new, $145 million state-of-the-art facility. For the first time, people can meet their cancer treatment needs without leaving the Valley.\nUTRGV health officials are calling it a one-stop shop. This means people can get treatment, therapy, and rehabilitation all under one roof.\n“This is a dream come true to us. It is a first-class medical treatment, including cancer infusions and surgeries. We can do research here, it is a wonderful place,” said UTRGV president Dr. Guy Bailey. “It is an educational facility, a research facility, a clinical facility.”\nLorenzo Sanchez said that for his family, this new cancer and surgery center is life-changing.\nSanchez is one of the engineers who worked on this building, and now his mom gets her cancer treatment here.\n“Having my mom be a part of the building and to be able to use the facility that we designed and constructed, it really is something special,” said Sanchez. “She is able to stay at home while getting the top treatment.”\nThis cancer and surgery center offers treatments like surgical oncology, hematology, diagnostics, and infusion therapy.\nThere are six operating rooms.\nOrthopedics and sports medicine are also part of the picture, along with an education hub for future health officials in the Valley.\n“The valley is no longer going to be seen as a region in need,’ said UTRGV Health Dr. Everardo Cobos. “It is going to be recognized as a place of discovery, of innovation, and a place where solutions take place.”\nThe center will help educate nursing students and medical residents. The research will also focus on cancers that specifically affect South Texas.\n“We are going to grow, and we are growing our own doctors, our own scientists,” said Dr. Cobos. “Homegrown experts who understand the valley, the culture, and the people and who are committed to serving them.”\nThe center has seen around 2,000 patients in the last month. It also plans to continue its partnership with Houston and San Antonio medical facilities.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
