  "text": "North Ed Foundation Announced as CherryT Ball Drop Beneficiary\nOct. 9, 2025\nCherryT Ball Drop organizers announced that the 2025 event will benefit the North Ed Foundation.\nAmong many other activities, the NorthEd Foundation supports students facing food insecurity through initiatives like the Student Emergency Relief Fund (SERF), which provides critical assistance including food, clothing,and basic medical care to students in need.\nThe CherryT Ball Drop has become a popular New Year’s Eve tradition, drawing thousands of residents and visitors to the intersection of Cass and Front Streets to celebrate the start of the New Year. Festivities kick off at 10:30 PM with live entertainment and a fun atmosphere for all, leading up to the iconic drop of the illuminated cherry at midnight.\n\"We’re thrilled to name the North Ed Foundation as this year’s CherryT Ball Drop beneficiary,\" says Kat Paye, Executive Director of the CherryT Ball Drop. \"Their dedication to fighting food insecurity and supporting students in need aligns perfectly with our mission to give back to the community. We’re proud to shine a spotlight on the incredible work they do and help further their impact in the Grand Traverse region.\"\nAll donations made at the gate will go directly to the North Ed Foundation.
