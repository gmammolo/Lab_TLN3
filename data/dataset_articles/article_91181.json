  "text": "West Coast premiership hero Liam Ryan completes trade to St Kilda for future picks\nWest Coast premiership forward Liam Ryan has officially been traded to St Kilda with the two clubs also exchanging future draft selections.\nThe Eagles have received a second-round pick tied to the Saints for next year in exchange for Ryan and a third-round pick tied to the WA club for 2027. It is the first time in AFL history that a draft pick has been traded two years in advance.\nRyan has joined the Saints on a three-year deal after kicking 158 goals in 125 games for the Eagles in eight seasons, earning All-Australian selection in 2020.\nThe 29-year-old was drafted by West Coast as a mature-age option out of Subiaco with pick No.26 in 2017 and played a historic part in the Eagles’ 2018 premiership victory in only his 13th game.\nRyan requested a trade to the Saints despite having a season to run on a two-year extension he signed before the in early 2024.\nIt came on the back of a 22-goal season in 20 games for Ryan under first-year coach Andrew McQualter, while also spending stints in the midfield.\nAs revealed by The West Australian, Ryan’s request to play under Ross Lyon came because of personal circumstances, with the Geraldton-product having a close relationship with several St Kilda players including star Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera, Brad Hill and Lance Collard.\nEarlier this week, Eagles list boss Matt Clarke said it was up to the Saints to come up with a strong offer or they would be happy to keep the forward to his contract.\n“Ryan is a contracted player, so we’re happy to keep him,” Clarke told Trade Radio.\n“He’s not disgruntled with the club at all. We’re not disgruntled the other way, either.\n“We think he can really add to us. He’s contracted next year, so it’ll be up to St Kilda to come to us with something that’s sufficient.”\nSt Kilda have been one of the biggest players in this year’s off-season, signing Tom De Koning and Jack Silvagni out of Carlton as free agents, while they traded out their first draft pick for this year to Gold Coast in exchange for midfielder Sam Flanders.\nThey also pulled out of a deal for Greater Western Sydney defender Leek Aleer despite being linked to the backman for most of the season.\nRuckman Rowan Marshall has requested a trade out of the Saints after they landed De Koning, with Geelong his ideal destination.",
