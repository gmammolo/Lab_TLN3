Your community next.\nThe advancement of Sharia law and Islamists in the United States must be stopped.\n[https://t.co/wcFbT5K85g]— Rep. Chip Roy Press Office (@RepChipRoy)\n[October 8, 2025]\nImporting Islamic terrorists into America is suicidal.\nThey all need to be deported.\n[https://t.co/BNoqMxuYx7]— Congressman Brandon Gill (@RepBrandonGill)\n[October 8, 2025]\nI just introduced the No Sharia Act, which would ensure that no U.S. court, public agency, or legal institution can ever enforce or legitimize Sharia law.⁰⁰You don’t get to come to this country and demand that our legal system accommodate your oppressive laws.\nProud to work…\n[pic.twitter.com/oEOZpO45gc]— Congressman Randy Fine (@RepFine)\n[September 20, 2025]\nProud to co-sponsor this bill to ban Sharia in the United States with\n[@RepFine].
