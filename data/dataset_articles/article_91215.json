  "text": "Dentsu announced the launch of dentsu.Composable, a suite of Snowflake Native Apps designed to help marketers activate advanced proprietary dentsu applications while maintaining complete control over their data privacy. The platform enables brands to achieve data accuracy, predictive intelligence, and integration efficiencies—all within a secure Snowflake environment.\nAvailable through the Snowflake Marketplace, dentsu.Composable supports audience intelligence across the entire media and creative campaign lifecycle via the dentsu.Connect platform. Additionally, Merkle, dentsu’s transformation consultancy and a Snowflake elite partner, will integrate dentsu.Composable into its enterprise data engineering and customer data technology services, including its Consumer 360 offering.\nWith its zero-copy, zero-share architecture, dentsu.Composable allows clients to cleanse, enrich, and activate data in place, eliminating the need to move sensitive information outside secure systems. Leveraging dentsu’s 35+ years of high-propensity data expertise, clients can now transform digital and identity solutions while driving measurable business outcomes without compromising data security.\n“As cloud adoption and agentic AI continue to accelerate, brands want more from their first-party data, and they shouldn’t have to send this data outside of their walls to realize the value,” said Jeremy Katz, Head of Identity Product & Solutions, dentsu. “dentsu.Composable, made possible through our Snowflake partnership, enables clients to bring our proprietary solutions to their data, eliminating data movement, increasing privacy, and ensuring interoperability across their data and tech stacks.”\nThe platform unlocks unprecedented data connectivity, combining multiple datasets with AI to deliver advanced analytics, trend identification, forecasting, and faster decision-making. Clients can tailor workflows to their business objectives and coordinate across dentsu.Composable apps with full control.\n“This new functionality is key to advancing our clients’ digital transformation efforts as we encourage them to move toward a cloud-based, AI-enhanced future,” said Pete Stein, Global Practice President, Merkle. “Owning data is one thing—putting it to use can be much harder. dentsu.Composable will help make our clients’ data a source of revenue and profitability.”\nThe launch reflects dentsu’s commitment to interoperability and data-driven marketing, allowing marketers to leverage existing technology investments and gain faster time to value. By deploying apps through the Snowflake Marketplace, clients benefit from a secure, governed, and scalable environment.\n“dentsu.Composable is a prime example of how data and identity partners can leverage the Snowflake Native Application Framework to deliver value where their marketing customers' data lives,” said Dennis Buchheim, Head of Media/Adv Industry, Snowflake. “Together, dentsu and Snowflake are enabling marketers to deploy and scale applications that unify their adtech and martech stack while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and security.”",
