  "text": "India News\nPM Modi Welcomes Agreement on First Phase of President Trump's Gaza Peace Plan\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi expressed optimism regarding the first phase of President Trump's peace plan for Gaza, emphasizing the potential for hostages' release and increased humanitarian aid to foster lasting peace.\nFILE - Cars and pedestrians move along a road amid widespread destruction caused by the Israeli military's ground and air offensive against Hamas in Gaza City's Jabaliya refugee camp, Friday, Feb. 7, 2025. (AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi, file)\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday welcomed the agreement on the first phase of President Donald Trump's proposed peace plan on Gaza, saying that he hoped the release of hostages and enhanced humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza would bring respite to them and pave the way for lasting peace in the region. PM Modi also praised Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu for displaying \"strong leadership\" by agreeing to the peace plan.\nThe terms of this initial phase include the imminent release of all hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces to a mutually agreed boundary. The announcement came via a Truth Social post, in which Trump confirmed that all hostages would soon be released and Israeli troops would withdraw to an agreed-upon line. “This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America,” Trump wrote, highlighting the international scope of the agreement.\nTrump praised the role of mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, noting that their collaboration was instrumental in facilitating this unprecedented step. “BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!” he added, framing the development as a landmark achievement in Middle East diplomacy. Observers see this as a crucial first step toward stabilizing the region, which has been engulfed in cyclical conflict and humanitarian crises. According to several diplomatic sources, the agreement emerged from ongoing talks held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, involving Israel, Hamas, and US envoys.\nWhat is the First Phase of Gaza Peace Plan\nThis milestone follows Trump’s September unveiling of a 20-point plan for Gaza, designed to bring an end to years of conflict. The roadmap includes phases on ceasefire, prisoner and hostage exchanges, a partial Israeli pullback, and ultimately a transition to a provisional governance structure in Gaza.\nIn parallel, negotiators have already exchanged prisoner and hostage lists, indicating momentum on both sides. Reports suggest Hamas has submitted names it wishes to release in exchange for Israeli captives.\nInternational Stakes and Next Steps\nTurkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said that Trump asked Turkey to engage with Hamas to secure acceptance of the plan. Turkey’s growing role underscores the delicate balance of regional diplomacy. Other nations, including Egypt and Qatar, have acted as key intermediaries in prior ceasefire efforts.\nThe breakthrough leaves thorny issues unresolved: disarming Hamas, Gaza’s governance, who oversees security, and what happens if either side violates terms. Legal and logistical frameworks will now be tested as stakeholders prepare to implement the deal. Meanwhile, tensions remain high, fighting continues in parts of Gaza, and the humanitarian crisis there persists.\nDiplomatic watchers caution the first phase is fragile—success hinges on trust, enforcement, and whether both parties stick to the agreed rules. But for now, Trump and his mediators claim a bold step forward in one of the world's most intractable conflicts.\nFor all the\nlatest newsandindia news, visit Times Now to get live updates andbreaking newsaround the world.Arun Nair author\nSince 2010 when he started his career, Arun Nair has established himself as a dynamic journalist, adept at covering a wide range of stories—from in-de...View More\nEnd of Article",
