  "text": "Fall and Halloween have arrived in Northeast Pennsylvania, and with them the promise of many spooky events throughout October. Among them is a tradition that has occurred in different locations over the past decade: The NEPA Horror Film Fest, a celebration of scary movies that will be held Saturday at the Circle Drive-In in Dickson City.\nThe festival, now in its 11th year, was started by Bobby Keller, a Scranton native who still organizes and oversees the event. The ideas for the festival can be traced back to when Keller himself made a horror movie and he was approached by people who wanted to screen it in the area.\n“I said ‘hey, let’s show a bunch of horror movies and not just mine,’ ” Keller said. “I didn’t want it to be all about me.”\nThe event had humble beginnings in coffeehouses and cafes throughout the area. In its early years, it was held at the River Street Jazz Cafe in Plains Twp. and Ale Mary’s in Scranton.\nBut with each year both attendance and ambition grew. Keller began to accept submissions from around the world, which today form a large percentage of the films that are shown. Celebrities from the horror world were invited to take pictures and sign autographs.\nThe realization of how big this small idea had grown hit Keller when he decided to move the event to the Scranton Art Haus, then known as the Iron Horse Movie Bistro. The venue was filled to capacity, to the point that they had to turn people away.\n“I thought that it was amazing that we had reached so many people, but I hated having to tell people they couldn’t come in,” said Keller. “The goal after those years was to find a place so big we wouldn’t have to turn away anyone.”\nIn 2018, the festival found a perfect home at the Circle Drive-In, a large drive-in movie theater on the Scranton-Carbondale Highway and one of only 300 drive-ins left in the country. The movie theater already had an event going on during Halloween — Circle of Screams, a haunted forest walk and manor — so the drive-in’s general manager, Dave Castelli, was more than happy to welcome the horror fest as another spooky attraction.\n“You have to keep changing things up and trying new things in the drive-in business, and of course we love showing films of all lengths and budgets,” Castelli said. “Bobby’s a great person to work with, so we love getting to do this year after year.”\nThis year introduces the Night Market, an extension of this “trying new things” philosophy. It will be a fall- and Halloween-themed vendor fair, curated by Noelle DePietro of the Wine, Witches, and Warlocks Festival that is also held at the drive-in.\nBoth Keller and DePietro describe the Night Market as being “where spooky meets spiritual.” Fifty local vendors and artists will be at the horror fest to sell all things festive and fall-themed. Fitting the name of the market, this will also be the first year that the horror fest is completely at night and not an all-day event.\n“The main reason we would start things earlier in the day was so people could get in line for celebrity signings. The festival’s felt more like a convention the past several years, and I wanted to try returning to that festival feeling this year,” Keller said. “The Night Market idea provided a good opportunity to do just that.”\nThere will also be live music at the Night Market, with local acts Atari+Mari and Squid Sterling, among others. Contrary to previous years, which featured a metal-based lineup, Keller and DePietro wanted a more acoustic selection to complete the “spooky meets spiritual” aesthetic of the Night Market.\nThe 11th annual NEPA Horror Film Fest and Night Market will be held Saturday at 5 p.m., with movies starting at 9:30 p.m. Admission is $15. Tickets can be purchased at nepahorror.com. Circle of Screams will also be running but is separately ticketed.\nAlthough each of the 13 short films being screened varies in scares and thrill level, Keller encourages people to treat it like an R-rated event and exercise their own discretion in bringing children.\nFor more information, check out the NEPA Horror and Circle Drive-In Facebook pages.\nIf you go\nWhat: 11th annual NEPA Horror Film Fest and Night Market\nWhere: Circle Drive-In, 1911 Scranton-Carbondale Highway, Dickson City\nWhen: Saturday at 5 p.m., with movies starting at 9:30 p.m.\nTickets: Admission is $15.
