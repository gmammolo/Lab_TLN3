  "text": "CHARLESTON, SC—Oct. 6, 2025— With a unanimous vote by its Board of Directors, the South Carolina State Ports Authority (SC Ports) announced Micah Mallace as President and CEO.\nMallace assumes leadership of the port after a long and distinguished career in the maritime and logistics industry. He previously served as the Chief Commercial Officer of SC Ports before becoming President of Harbor Logistics, a third-party logistics company specializing in port drayage, warehousing, and transload operations.\n“I am humbled by the opportunity to serve as the next President and CEO at SC Ports. The port team and South Carolina’s broader maritime community provide port service that is unmatched, and I know, together, we will further strengthen our competitiveness,” said Mallace.\n“The impact of our seaports reaches well beyond the borders of South Carolina,” said Chairman of the Board Bill Stern. “What we do and how we operate influence global trade and the worldwide economy. Micah Mallace understands that significance and responsibility. He has the vision, experience and nuts-and-bolts knowledge to navigate the many facets of today’s maritime industry. We are extremely fortunate to have secured him as our new President and CEO.”\nNews of the SC Ports’ leadership vacancy attracted widespread interest, but the Board and government leaders rapidly coalesced behind Mallace.\n“I can think of no better person to lead SC Ports and know he will bring the necessary vision to grow as a top ten U.S. container port,” said interim CEO Phil Padgett\n“Hapag-Lloyd values the reliable service provided by SC Ports, which is why we are expanding our coverage at the Port of Charleston in 2025, said President of Hapag-Lloyd North America Stuart Sandlin. “We look forward to working with Micah in his new role and continuing to deliver efficient services for our customers.”\n“Micah Mallace is an excellent choice to lead the SC Ports Authority, given his experience and deep knowledge of the waterfront community,” said Senate President Thomas Alexander “The Port is vital to South Carolina’s economic development and to the success of the businesses and citizens who rely on the port. I commend Chairman Stern and the Board for an appointment that will help ensure the Port’s success for years to come.”\n“I applaud the hard work of Chairman Stern and the SPA Board to identify and appoint Micah Mallace as its new President and CEO,” said Speaker of the House Murrell Smith. “Micah’s experience and qualifications firmly align with our ports’ mission and he will be an invaluable asset as we move forward in the highly competitive maritime industry.”\nMicah Mallace is a native of Charleston, SC and is a graduate of the College of Charleston. He is married and has three children.",
