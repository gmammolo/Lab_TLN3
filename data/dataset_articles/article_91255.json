  "text": "Queer Van Kult: The House Wears Our Memory Like Skin\nQueer Van Kult: The House Wears Our Memory Like Skin\nOctober 11, 2025 | Alice Austen House Museum, Staten Island, NY\n5:00 – 8:00 PM\nOn National Coming Out Day, NYC-based queer arts collective Queer Van Kult (QVK) presents a outdoor one-day, site-specific performance and installation event at the Alice Austen House Park taking place on October 11, 2025, QVK presents a poetic act of remembrance, reflection, and reclamation—honoring queer lineage, local memory, and personal transformation through sculpture, performance, sound, and immersive installations.\nDeveloped in collaboration with the Alice Austen House Museum, QVK invites the public to wander a landscape charged with objects, gestures, and offerings—conduits of grief, joy, queer identity, and cultural archaeology.\nFeatured Artists:\nBexiexz\nB!tch Boys (Ri Tornello and Jenno collaboration)\nPei Shan Lee\nZoë Tirado\nw/ assistance from Samantha Tirado\nDoors Open 5 PM\nInstallations + Video Work + Durational Performances 5 – 8 PM\nPerformance Schedule\nB!tch Boys 6:30 PM\nNicie Mok 7 PM\nChris Conde 7:30 PM\nArtist Statement\nQueer Van Kult: The House Wears Our Memory Like Skin is a site-responsive offering: a ritual of remembrance, transformation, and queer imagination. We are intervening in the land, in time, in memory.\nThis project is an homage to the places that shaped us, the people who saved us, and the ghosts that haunt and hold us. It is our love letter to chosen family, queer ancestors, abandoned objects, and the stories written into the shorelines and shadows of Staten Island.\nAlice Austen House, once a home, now a historic LGBTQ+ landmark, serves as a grounding point. We scatter personal relics across its grounds: driftwood shrines, embedded household objects, hair in the hills, pantyhose stuffed with memory. We reflect on queer solitude, secrecy, lineage, and the process of becoming.\nWe ask: What do we inherit? What do we carry? What are we ready to leave behind?\nThis is not a monument. This is a living archive.\nA temporal, embodied queer spell.\nTicket price: $20 suggested donation",
