  "text": "Cam Newton celebrates arrival of baby No. 9 (Getty Images) Cam Newton, the former NFL quarterback, is celebrating a major milestone in his personal life. The 36-year-old revealed he has welcomed his ninth child, this time with girlfriend Jasmin Brown. In a sneak peek of the upcoming October 16 episode of The Tamron Hall Show, Newton told host Tamron Hall, “Oh, he’s already here.” The couple, who began dating in 2022, are already parents to a 19-month-old daughter. Cam Newton celebrates family growth\nEarlier this year, Jasmin Brown shared her excitement over their growing family in a heartfelt Mother’s Day post. “Feeling ALL the Love, kicks and elbows,” the Zatima actress wrote on Instagram. “Cheers to our growing tribe.” Newton himself has expressed the joy and purpose his children bring to his life. “Did I tell you I want more?” he told People in February. “But jokingly, and not jokingly, they really give me my purpose and there’s so many different things that I look at to say, they’re my refuge. They’re my peace. They’re my encouragement.” Newton is no stranger to fatherhood. Beyond his children with Brown, he is dad to Chosen, 9, Camidas, 7, Cashmere, 6, and Sovereign-Dior, 8, with ex-girlfriend Kia Proctor. He also lovingly raises Shakira, 18, Proctor’s daughter from a previous relationship. “I proudly say I have eight children—six biologically through me,” Newton said during an April 2024 episode of Club Shay Shay. “I don’t believe in stepchildren. What my biological kids get, everybody gets. I don’t have no favorites. I’m raising kings and queens.” Cam Newton’s family philosophy\nIn addition, Newton shares son Caesar, 6, with ex-girlfriend LaReina Shaw, and is a supportive figure for her son Jaden, 19. His approach to parenting emphasizes love, equality, and attention for every child. Even with nine children, Newton balances fatherhood with his personal life while maintaining his public persona as a former NFL star. The arrival of his latest son marks another milestone in his journey as a devoted dad, showcasing his commitment to family as a cornerstone of his life. Cam Newton’s growing family is a testament to his dedication as a father, showing that his life off the field is as rich and meaningful as his time as an NFL star.
