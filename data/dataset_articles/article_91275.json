  "text": "GRAND RAPIDS — The Red Arrow Raiders football team held off Northpointe Christian 48-40 on Oct. 3 to go 6-0 on the season.\nThe home team took an early 6-0 lead as Daniel Bram ran 5 yards for a touchdown. A 23-yard TD run by Lawson Brenner put the Raiders in a 12-0 hole.\nColten Lijewski ran 9 yards for a second-quarter touchdown to help Red Arrow pull with 12-8.\nNorthpointe took an 18-8 lead thanks to Jacob Brown’s 20-yard touchdown run late in the second stanza.\nBut the Raiders answered just before half-time as Cooper Lynch hacked in a 30-yard touchdown pass from Lijewski to make it a 18-14 ballgame.\nWith 9:20 seconds to go in the third quarter Lijewski ran 90 yards for a touchdown.\nWith 3:53 left in the third quarter, Lynch caught a 65-yard scoring strike from Lijewski.\nWith 11:13 remaining in the fourth quarter, Lynch caught a 15-yard TD pass from Lijewski and Lynch also snagged a pass for the two point conversion making the score 34-18.\nThe Mustangs closed to within 34-32 in the late going before Lynch and Lijewski hooked up for a 98-yard scoring play.\nNorthpointe pulled even at 40-40 before Lijewski provided the winning margin with just 22 seconds to go thanks to a 20-yard rush to the end zone allowed by the two-point conversion.\nLynch had a late interception to seal the win.\nThe Raiders are scheduled to play the River Valley Homecoming game on Oct. 10.",
