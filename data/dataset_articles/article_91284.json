  "text": "The report identifies a new generation of travellers who see travel as an extension of their identity, defying traditional archetypes Booking.com, in collaboration with Accenture, has released the third edition of its flagship “How India Travels 2025” report. The report highlights a major transformation in India’s domestic travel landscape — where accommodation is no longer just a backdrop but the cornerstone of the journey. Today’s Indian traveller is moving beyond room bookings to seek curated, authentic, and digitally shareable experiences that make the stay itself the destination. The New Indian Traveller The report identifies a new generation of travellers who see travel as an extension of their identity, defying traditional archetypes: Trip Architects (26–55, primarily women): 73%¹ of respondents say women now lead destination selection, budgeting, and itinerary planning, prioritising safety, flexibility, and cultural immersion. Next-gen Co-pilots (under 15): Young travellers influencing family decisions, often holding “veto power” over hotels and activities. Unscripted Explorers (28–43): Travellers seeking short, themed getaways focused on wellness, food, or nature, valuing design-led spaces and flexible perks. Timeless Travellers (60+): Older travellers seeking to reconnect with heritage, spirituality, and culture — redefining age as no barrier to exploration. Accommodation Becomes the Attraction According to the report, 80%² of Indian travellers plan to spend most of their time at their accommodation — far above the global average of 51%. Nearly four in five travellers actively seek unconventional, curated stays, shifting the industry’s focus from “What’s the rate?” to “What makes this stay memorable?” To meet this demand, hospitality providers are expanding on-property experiences such as book readings, spiritual workshops, and art pop-ups. Non-room revenue — particularly from food, beverage, and events — now contributes up to 50%³ of premium segment earnings. The report also highlights the rise of spiritual tourism, with Ayodhya welcoming over 16 million pilgrims in 2024, creating a USD 59 billion⁴ opportunity. Over 300 premium hotels are set to launch across spiritual hubs like Katra, Puri, and Tirupati⁵, while boutique hideaways and heritage villas gain popularity for their low-impact, culture-rich experiences. Technology and Payments Powering Seamless Travel Indian travellers are increasingly turning to AI and digital payments to enhance their journeys. Over half use AI tools for planning, with 83% saying it simplifies travel, 82% using it to avoid crowds, and 80% appreciating AI-curated local experiences⁶. Simultaneously, India’s payment revolution — driven by UPI, BNPL, and EMIs — is transforming travel decisions. Booking.com’s Pay at Hotel model is enabling flexible bookings and attracting new traveller segments, while hotels offering multiple payment options report higher conversion rates. Unlocking India’s Hospitality Potential With domestic travel searches rising from 103 million in 2022 to 141 million in 2024⁸, hotel demand is projected to grow 10.5% annually through 2027, outpacing supply growth⁹. Branded hotel supply remains low at 138 rooms per million people, compared to 1,500+ in developed markets¹⁰. India’s total room inventory is expected to reach 3.1 million by 2029¹¹, creating major opportunities for investors and operators — particularly in Tier-II and Tier-III cities, where occupancy is now stable year-round. “Over the past decade, domestic tourism has grown - not just in volume - but also in character; signaling a shift from mere sightseeing to experience-seeking… By aligning public investment with private sector innovation, we can unlock immense value and position India as a year-round, experience-rich destination,” said Sh. Suman Billa, Director General, Ministry of Tourism, Government of India. Santosh Kumar, Regional Manager, South Asia, Booking.com, said: “India’s domestic traveller is rewriting the rules of travel. For them, the stay isn’t just part of the journey anymore — it is the destination itself.” Anshul Gupta, MD & Travel Lead, Accenture, added: “The defining characteristic of the new Indian traveller is the demand for hyper-personalisation backed by intelligent technology… The winners will be those who can scale innovation responsibly and create seamless, memorable experiences.”\nDiscover what drives your weight management journey.
