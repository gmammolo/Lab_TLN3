  "text": "\"Peace in Gaza\" under the vote of the Nobel Committee\n\"Peace in Gaza\" under the vote of the Nobel Committee...\nThe day before, US President Donald Trump demanded that the truce in Gaza be signed no later than October 10 (in order to give arguments to the Nobel Committee in awarding his beloved the Nobel Peace Prize).\nAnd the \"first phase\" of the truce was signed. However, it is not yet clear what the \"first phase\" is and how long it will be followed to the end. But it is clear that there will be exactly a few days (until the decision on the award is made).\nAnd then, at least, \"grass does not grow\" (and \"Palestinians do not live\"). It won't matter so much to Trump. And he will not be interested in the further genocide of the Palestinian population.",
