It was tiring work for little money, but it was a start.\nBy 2004, he had saved enough to rent a small shop. It was modest but gave him a fixed place to trade, and people knew where to find him. Six years later, in 2010, he opened a larger store that he describes as his first supermarket. This became Triple Blessings, which gave the community a central place to buy essentials and Cosmas a foothold as a businessman.",
