Amongst those challenges, Sweet Catch BK prevails while celebrating its third anniversary. (Brenika Banks video)\nThe importance of Black ownership within the hospitality industry is critical, especially in predominantly Caribbean and Black neighborhoods. Seafood-meets-soul-food establishment Sweet Catch BK recently co-hosted its third anniversary dinner party with Ten to One Rum. The celebration was held on Thursday, Sept. 25, at Sweet Catch BK’s location in Prospect Lefferts Gardens. Restaurant owner Ka-Wana Jefferson and the Caribbean rum company’s Market Manager, Eli Servance III, spoke about the significance of Black ownership within the hospitality industry as well as its challenges.\nJefferson led her team as she greeted guests and customers while making sure her restaurant’s “3rd Year Anniversary Unapologetically Black Dinner Party” went as planned. Her crew worked hard to ensure everyone in attendance, including Black media outlets, customers, and friends and family members, had a fantastic experience. The restaurant’s newest member, Chef Erica, was praised for her outstanding contributions to the brand. The dinner was curated by their guest chef, Alex, and main chef Erica.\nSweet Catch BK opened in September 2022. The establishment’s Brand General Manager, Nucomme, also known as the “Magic Person for Sweet Catch,” hosted the dinner celebration. Jefferson and her crew proved their resilience after some uncertainty about the restaurant’s future earlier this year. Jefferson described her establishment’s environment as looking “a lot different.” The owner was concerned about her number of customers months ago. Nucomme provided comfort for Jefferson, along with their staff, through that challenging time.\n“That’s just a testimony of where we were then to where we are now,” said Jefferson. She humbly thanked her staff for their support. “This is a big milestone for us, so I really appreciate you all being here to celebrate,” she continued. “I’m so happy that we are in a different place — I owe it to my team, one hundred percent.” Jefferson praised her chef, Erica, who joined the Sweet Catch crew over a year ago. “She’s changed the trajectory of what we have going,” said Jefferson. “You cannot grow a restaurant without consistency.”\nAccording to the National Restaurant Association, 16% of restaurant firms are Black or African American-owned. For New York State specifically, that accounts for only 10% of restaurants with Black owners.\nSweet Catch BK has found a refreshed pace and partnership with Ten to One Rum. This collaboration’s objective is to showcase the importance of Black hospitality’s existence and unity. Ten to One was founded in July 2019 by Marc Farrell. The Trinidad and Tobago native moved to the United States at 16, where he attended different colleges and universities to learn business. After spending time as the CEO at a major coffee chain, Farrell decided to pursue a business that resonated more with his Caribbean background.\n“Our whole thing is strength in numbers and building a community,” said Market Manager Eli Servance III. Every bottle of their rum represents other Caribbean countries, including Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Barbados. This is the first Black owned rum company in the United States. Ten to One Rum is intentionally in many Black owned places, like Sweet Catch BK, which echoes their value to build up the Black community.\n“We’re always doing business with ourselves — of course, we want to elevate each other, build this community,” said Servance III. During the dinner party, he mentioned the negative perception about rum due to pirates and ships. Ten to One Rum aims to erase those negative beliefs and present rum as a source that elevates Black communities and businesses. The rum brand recently received a new investment from Atlanta singer & performer Ciara.\nTen to One Rum is available now at Sweet Catch BK.
