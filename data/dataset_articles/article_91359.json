  "text": "Delaware is preparing to distribute a third round of funding to Delaware organizations looking to attract visitors to First State sporting venues.\nThe Delaware Sports Tourism Capital Investment Fund was seeded with a third round of $10 million in grant money by this year's Bond Bill, and looks to help new or exiting sports facilities improve their facilities in the ever-growing sports market.\nIn its first two rounds, the Delaware Tourism Office awarded $21.3 million to nine different sites, including their 2023 investment they said generated over $20.2 million in state and local taxes along with 3,000 jobs.\nLast December's recipients were Factory Sports in Frankford, Hudson Fields near Milton, the Bethany Tennis Club, Dover Motor Speedway, and the Kirkwood Soccer Complex near New Castle.\nIndoor Track Delaware received $6 million from the initial $11.3 million investment in June 2024, but there has been no definitive word on when, or if, that project will ever take place, in what has been a prolonged struggle to replace a hole in Delaware's running community created when the University of Delaware converted its indoor track at the Field House into an indoor practice facility.\nThat money was awarded to Buccini/Pollin Group's Wilmington Sports, LLC.\nAccording to an FAQ on the Visit Delaware website, \"should an applicant fail to start construction on the sports facility within a certain period of time (e.g. 2 years), the Division has the right to recapture grant funds.\"\nDE Turf in Frederica, Midway Motion and Fitness near Rehoboth, and STATS Tournaments in Bear also received portions of the initial money.\nApplicants are expected to showcase how they will attract out-of-state visitors, not just Delawareans, to use the facility, already have committed funds outside of the potential grant money, and explain tourism-based events they will host.\nThe Delaware Tourism Office will hold an Informational Webinar on November 6 at 11 a.m., with applications being accepted from November 12-December 12, 2025.\nTwo public meetings will be held in early 2026, with the announcement of the awards expected to take place in March 2026.\nThis round of funding comes at a time when several sports venues have been proposed in recent months, including an ice arena to replace the Delaware State Fair's Centre Ice Arena, and a non-profit looking to build a swimming venue in the Dover area.\nBoth were among the 18 organizations that applied for the December 2024 money.\nDelaware State University and the University of Delaware are among the entities that have been rejected in the past, but the state of Delaware found other ways to siphon money in their directions for UD's new softball complex and DSU's pending football complex.",
