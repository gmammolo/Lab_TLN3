  "text": "Wild and Free Film Festival prepares to launch\nGOLETA, Calif.-The Wild and Free Film Festival served up movie popcorn and played some trailers in preparation for a number of events.\nFestival organizers, sponsors and Goleta community leaders posed for a ceremonial ribbon cutting on Wednesday afternoon.\nThe main festival is on November 14-16 at the Camino Real Cinemas in Goleta, but a kick off launch party will take place at Elings Park on October 18th with an outdoor screening of \"The Goonies.\"\nFestival founder Gareth Kelly credited his wife for naming the festival.\nOne of the highlights of the festival will be the premier of a documentary produced by Leonardo Dicaprio.\nThe film is about saving animals in war-torn Ukraine.\nThe movie star couldn't make the ribbon cutting but he was there in spirit.\nFor more information about the festival visit http://www.wildandfreefilm.org",
