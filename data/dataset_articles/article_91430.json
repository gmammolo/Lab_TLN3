  "text": "Have you ever wondered about the vibrant art on Boise's utility boxes? The Traffic Box Art Project, running since 2009 through the Boise City Department of Arts and History, transforms these eyesores into canvases for local artists.\nAlaggio Laurino, public art collections manager, said, \"We are specifically looking for Idaho artists but one of the great things about this program is that it lends itself to both emerging as well as established artists.\"\nEach year, new art graces the streets, with past works like Devon Ruscito's \"Boise Squared\" and Ken Zabel's \"Rockstars on Parade.\" This year's theme focuses on climate action and neighborhood connection.\nLaurino explained, \"This year we're working with Public Works once again and continuing on with that climate action map to include things like waste management, water renewal, building food processes, all the ways in which we can improve the accountability of the way in which we are impacting the environment as a city.\"\nArtists of all ages and mediums are encouraged to apply by Oct. 15. There is a $1,200 award for each original art piece as well as a collaboration with a fabricator to truly customize each utility box. There are 220+ of the decorated boxes throughout Boise. Other cities participate in similar programs that have the same goal to beautify the city as well as detouring graffiti and vandals.\nJustin Masi, one of the selected artists, shared, \"I encourage people just to go out and walk around the city and see what it has to offer, there's a lot out there that's happening and I think it's just a great opportunity for you to go out and find it.\"\nIf you are interested in applying or looking for more information, follow the Boise City Department of Arts and History link.",
