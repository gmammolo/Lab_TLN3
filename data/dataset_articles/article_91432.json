  "text": "MARSHALL COUNTY, Ala. (WHNT) – More than 200 students from Marshall Technical School came together this week for the school’s 13th annual Pink Glove Dance, an October tradition that raises money to support breast cancer programs across Marshall County.\nThe event, held as part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, helps fund the Mammography Assistance Program of Marshall County, which provides financial help for screenings, treatment, transportation, and recovery supplies for local breast cancer survivors.\nStudents from several technical programs participated in the event, including the Collision Repair Program, which built and painted a car hood in black and pink. They invited students with family members affected by breast cancer to sign it.\nAmong those signing was Marshall County Superintendent Dr. Cindy Wigley, who added her name in honor of her own family members.\nIn addition to the dance, students sold pink T-shirts and raised more than $1,500 for the cause. Over the past 13 years, the Pink Glove Dance has helped raise thousands of dollars to ensure local residents can access vital breast cancer screenings and care.\nMedical Prep students also played a key role in organizing the event, demonstrating that young people can make a real impact in the fight against breast cancer.",
