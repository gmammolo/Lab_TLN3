  "text": "The Philippine Fiber Industry Development Authority (PhilFIDA), led by Executive Director Arnold ‘Ali’ I. Atienza and joined by Engr. Eugene N. Galela, OIC Regional Director for Region 10, along with its team from the Central and Regional Offices, visited Misamis Oriental on October 6–7, 2025, to explore partnerships with the province’s Local Government Units.\nIn a productive courtesy meeting with Hon. Governor Juliet T. Uy, discussions centered on the re-operationalization of the Tissue Culture Laboratory in Sugbongcogon—an initiative seen as vital in providing quality planting materials to improve the province’s fiber output and strengthen its capacity to meet growing demands. To inspire possibilities, PhilFIDA also presented a video on fiber innovations, showcasing how Philippine fibers can break into international lifestyle and fashion markets and create greater opportunities for local communities.\nThe team proceeded to Sugbongcogon for the site inspection of the Tissue Culture Laboratory, where they were warmly welcomed by Municipal Agriculturist Mr. Johnny Sumaylo on behalf of Mayor Cheezee G. Lagbas.\nThe visit then extended to LGU Villanueva, where the team was likewise received by the Vice Mayor Hon. Jeric G. Emano and the municipal team representing Mayor Julio T. Uy. This included site assessments for an open-type abaca nursery and a potential PhilFIDA Regional Office, underscoring the agency’s long-term commitment to the region’s fiber industry.\nThe visit concluded with an audience with Governor Juliet T. Uy, highlighted by the presence of Mayor Cheezee Z. Lagbas, who took time from his schedule to personally express his support for PhilFIDA’s initiatives.\nWhile this was only the first meeting, it marks a hopeful beginning of stronger collaboration between PhilFIDA and the provincial and municipal leaders of Misamis Oriental, as the agency continues to build opportunities for farmers, communities, and the future of the fiber industry in Region X.",
