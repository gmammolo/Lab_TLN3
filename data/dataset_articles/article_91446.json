  "text": "By Lucky Larry ,\n54 minutes ago\n( Athens, Texas ) The Texas Freshwater Fisheries Center in Athens , Texas, is once again reeling in both first-time and long-time anglers.\nAfter being closed for two years and going through an $8.5 million renovation project, the Texas Freshwater Fisheries Center celebrated its grand reopening on July 1, 2025, but it was a short-lived grand reopening because it suddenly closed its gates to the public on Friday, August 8.\nDownload the KTYL Mobile App Now After two months of being closed, the Texas Freshwater Fisheries Center in Athens is now open and once again welcoming guests and introducing them to the wonderful world of fishing.\nWhy the Texas Freshwater Fisheries Center Closed Again After reopening in July, it was discovered during a roof replacement job that a metal structural support beam in the visitor’s center behind an educational display, which was not a part of the renovation, had become corroded and was a potential hazard to the facility. Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Texas Freshwater Fisheries Center management decided to close the facility out of caution so that work could be completed.\nSafety Repairs Complete — Gates Reopen in Athens Now that the work is completed, the unique facility held a grand re-reopening of sorts on October 8 as the gates once again opened to guests so that they can learn more about the fish of Texas and cast a line in a stock pond without the need for a fishing license.\nREAD MORE –> 5 East Texas Lakes Named Best For Fishing In The State Of Texas\nWhat Visitors Can Experience Now East Texans and Texans are now able to catch a fish, go on a hatchery tour, hop on a tram tour, check out the Hall of Fame, walk the Wetlands Trail, view the Gallery Tanks, visit the conservation center, and most importantly, FISH! Don’t worry about acquiring any fishing gear; it’s all on site and free to use, including bait. However, if you have your own rod and reel, you’re welcome to tie on that hook, cast it out in the pond, and set that hook.\nTexas Freshwater Fisheries Center Hours and Admission The Texas Freshwater Fisheries Center is currently operating on its fall and winter schedule and is open Wednesday through Saturday from 9a to 4p and Sunday from 1p-4p. It’s $5.50 for ages 17 and up, with discounted prices for younger visitors, and the facility does offer a season pass.\nList of the Most Beautiful Lakes Found in Texas Texas has some stunning lakes!
