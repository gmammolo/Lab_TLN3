  "text": "The Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) has introduced a total of 8 596 smart classrooms as part of its initiative to modernise learning spaces with state-of-the-art information and communications technology (ICT).\nThe rollout prioritises township secondary schools and selected primary schools, in line with the GDE ICT Strategy.\n“For years, we have been installing LED interactive display panels in selected schools to support interactive and collaborative learning,” the department said on Friday.\nThese devices include high-definition screens, multi-touch capability, stylus support, software integration, and multiple connectivity options, including Wi-Fi, LAN, HDMI, USB and Bluetooth.\nEach unit comes with a warranty, educator training, and maintenance support. Full ICT schools receive smart classrooms from Grades Seven to 12, while township fee- and no-fee-paying schools receive them from Grades 10 to 12, depending on classroom infrastructure readiness.\nSmart classrooms meet minimum standards, including electricity, safety, and security, and are equipped with LED boards.\nOver the past three financial years, the department invested in LED interactive display boards as follows:\n* 2022/ 23 – 1 020 boards at R123 950 each\n* 2023/ 24 – 1 000 boards at R124 730 each\n* 2024/ 25 – 500 boards at R125 300 each\nALSO READ : Local CPF units get boosted by Gauteng Department of Community Safety\n“These devices were chosen to support interactive learning, align with pedagogical requirements, integrate with existing ICT infrastructure, and ensure operational durability,” the department said. Installation, training, and maintenance are included in the unit costs.\nThe 2025/ 26 financial year will see no additional smart classrooms due to budget constraints.\nBongani Rainmaker Logistics manages the provisioning and installation of LED boards, with a project valued at R63m for 2024/ 25, of which R62.65m has been transferred.\nSupport for special schools\nThe department employs 655 full-time specialists at special schools, including 522 therapists and 133 nurses, supported by psychologists at head office and district offices. Learner-to-specialist ratios range from 1:50 to 1:129.\nTo address staffing needs, 453 teacher and 125 specialist vacancies remain. Recruitment occurs twice a year nationally, with the Occupation-Specific Dispensation (OSD) helping to retain specialist staff.\nCurriculum offerings include:\n* Technical Occupational Curriculum in 44 schools\n* Differentiated Curriculum Assessment Policy Statement (DCAPS) for Severe Intellectual Disabilities in 73 schools\n* Learning Programme for Profound Intellectual Disabilities in 27 schools\nEducators in special schools are highly qualified, with 99.66% professionally registered with the South African Council of Educators, and 22% holding additional accredited qualifications in inclusive education.\nCase study: Samson Learners with Special Educational Needs (LSEN) School\nThe Samson LSEN School has 486 learners and received R8.9m in 2025/ 26 for teaching, well-being, transport, and skills development.\nHalf of teaching time is dedicated to practical skills under the Technical Occupation Curriculum, covering Consumer Studies, Motor Mechanics, Hair Care, Computer Literacy, and Woodwork.\nSkills classrooms funded in 2022 were completed in late 2024 and are now being finalised for full use, accommodating up to 15 learners each.\nInfrastructure updates\nThe Nancefield Primary School project in Eldorado Park, south of Johannesburg, has reached 69% completion.\nThe main contractor, SMC Construction & Building, is supported by DNA Land Use Consultants.\n“All monies owed to the contractor have been paid, with an additional R87m allocated for project completion,” the department said.\nThe department emphasises its ongoing commitment to improving teaching, learning, safety, and skills development across Gauteng.",
