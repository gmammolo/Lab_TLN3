  "text": "Return of the chocolate mega mousse\nRoula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.\nWhen you order the chocolate mousse at The Parakeet pub in Kentish Town in London, you get treated to a little performance. It starts with a small bowl of white chocolate crumb and biscuit tuile landing on your table. Then a huge mixing bowl of light, fluffy mousse arrives with a waiter. A large spoonful of one is ceremoniously dolloped on to the other.\nThe mousse, which contains whipped egg whites and Valrhona Guanaja 70 per cent chocolate, has been on the menu for a year. “It will be hard to take off,” says head chef Ben Allen. “People travel here just to try it.”\nIt’s one of many chocolate mousses turning up again on restaurant menus. Mousse dates back to savoury dishes in 18th-century France but, says chocolatier Paul A Young, “the latest evolution harks back to the 1970s and 1980s when mousse was among the desserts wheeled out on a trolley”. Elizabeth David’s classic recipe from 1960’s French Provincial Cooking has never gone out of favour, but other landmark recipes include the white chocolate mousse created by New York-based chef Michel Fitoussi in 1977 and some of Marco Pierre White’s creations from the 1990s. “His champagne mousse was a favourite,” says Young.\nPart of the dish’s current appeal is nostalgia. “My memories of chocolate mousse are the supermarket pots where you get a six-pack and crack them off,” says Toklas head chef Chris Shaw. “It makes me think of eating them when I was a kid.”\nAs customers crave less fanciful dishes, the dessert has become a way for chefs to strive for excellence in simplicity. “Chocolate mousse is a rich, indulgent treat but in a light and palatable format,” says chocolatier Philip Khoury. At many of the French-style bistros that have opened in London recently, the dish feels particularly welcome. Claude Bosi’s mousse to share at Josephine Bouchon, for instance, contains Valrhona Manjari 64 per cent chocolate with eggs, cream and sugar and is served under a veil of dark chocolate curls.\nFor chefs who value the provenance of their ingredients, the dish is also a showcase for fine single-origin chocolate. “A mousse aerates and ‘elongates’ the flavour,” says Bar Valette’s chef patron Isaac McHale, who uses Original Beans’ Virunga 70 per cent in his mousse topped with sweetened, lightly whipped vanilla cream. “We tasted a lot of chocolates, and Virunga stands out for its cherry, tea and stewed-prune flavours.”\nThere’s no definitive recipe. Most start with melted chocolate or a chocolate-custard base, into which you fold whipped egg whites and/or whipped cream. But it’s down to personal preference. A meringue-based mousse yields a bubbly texture that lifts off the tongue. A custard-based mousse is creamier with a prolonged taste. Carousel’s co-founder and chef patron Ollie Templeton uses Island 55 per cent milk chocolate and no sugar. “We whip the eggs with boiling honey to create a light and airy texture.” At Harley’s, chef Richard Foster has devised a version made only with chocolate and eggs; it hovers between bitterness and sweetness and is neither too rich nor too light.\n“You have to work hard to make a chocolate mousse people don’t like,” says McHale. I broadly agree. In Aleksandra Crapanzano’s book Chocolat: Parisian Desserts and Other Delights (Scribner), a chapter devoted to mousse and similar desserts offers an extensive list of toppings. These include caramelised hazelnuts, dried rose petals, candied orange zest and raspberries tossed in crème de cassis. A drizzle of olive oil and flaky sea salt are popular too. I’m also a fan of Fabri Amarena black cherries, which accompany my favourite version at The Devonshire pub. I like mine with half a pint of Guinness.\nFor home cooks, chocolate mousse presents challenges. Get the temperatures wrong or overwhip your cream and you risk it splitting or turning grainy. Among the many recipes intended to bypass these problems comes another from Khoury’s book Beyond Baking (Quadrille). This rich, truffle-like mousse, made using only two ingredients – dark chocolate (minimum 65 per cent solids) and soya milk – is basically a whipped ganache in which the cocoa butter delivers the creaminess and allows it to set. “It’s so simple it can even be made with water instead of soya milk,” says Khoury. “That version would dissipate on your tongue faster and result in a mousse of immense purity.”\nThe Parakeet is available to book on OpenTable\nFT Appetites, which brings together stories from FT Magazine, HTSI and FT Globetrotter, is supported by OpenTable.
