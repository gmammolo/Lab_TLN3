  "text": "Dubai freezone companies get permit to bid for state tenders\nDubai has introduced a permit allowing freezone companies to operate on the mainland and bid for government tenders and contracts.\nThe Free Zone Mainland Operating Permit has been launched by the Dubai Business Registration and Licensing Corporation under the Department of Economy and Tourism, in partnership with the emirate’s Free Zone Council.\nThe permit enables freezone companies to participate in non-regulated sectors such as technology, consultancy, design, professional services and trading. It costs AED5,000 ($1,361) for six months and is renewable at the end of that period.\nBusinesses will be subject to a 9 percent corporate tax and must maintain separate financial records in line with Federal Tax Authority regulations. They are allowed to deploy their existing staff for mainland operations without hiring new employees.\nThe initiative is expected to boost cross-jurisdictional business by 15 to 20 percent in its first year, the Department of Economy and Tourism said. This will benefit more than 10,000 active free zone companies, who will gain access to large government contracts previously limited to mainland-licensed entities.\nFurther reading:\nIn August the Dubai government said its economy increased 4 percent year on year to AED120 billion ($33 billion) in the first quarter of 2025, driven by strong public-private partnerships.\nThe government has set expenditure at over AED86 billion, with revenues expected at AED98 billion for 2025.\nRegister now: It’s easy and free\nAGBI registered members can access even more of our unique analysis and perspective on business and economics in the Middle East.\nWhy sign uP\nAlready registered?
