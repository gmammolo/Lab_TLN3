  "text": "Cass Lake is the site of four houses being constructed by Habitat for Humanity, the families selected soon to be calling them home.\nTara Novak of Bemidji saw a flyer on the subject and determined to “give it a shot.”\nThe mother of four sons, Ahki who’s19, Cole, also 19 – “who came into our lives two years ago,” Miskwaaabines, 17, and Giizis, 15, – “all over six feet tall” – were experiencing tight living quarters in their two bedroom apartment.\n“Most times, I’d be on the couch,” she said of sleeping arrangements.\nNovak arrived late for the meeting in Cass Lake. “The room was packed,” she recalled of standing in the doorway to learn of the procedure. Once forms were completed the Family Selection Committee reviewed applications.\nNovak and Petra Rodriquez were two of the four selected.\nInitially, Rodriquez, the mother of three, worried that it may be a scam. “I hadn’t heard of it. And I didn’t know anyone who’d applied for this.”\nTwo months later, Novak got the call that she’d been selected for the round of interviews.\n“I was so nervous,” she recalled telling her sister, brother and father, who encouraged her to “say some prayers” in her native Anishinaabe tradition.\n“I told them my life story,” Novak said. “They were so kind, so loving.”\nTwo months later, she got the call at work, at the Northwest Indian Community Development Center, where she conducts intakes for those who are on a job search, treatment, training and who’ve been released from prison.\n“Are you sitting down?” she was asked.\n“Yes,” she replied.\n“Your family was chosen.”\n“I didn’t say anything for a good two minutes,” Novak said, having been astounded by the news. “My prayers were answered. The boys are the reason for everything I do,” she said of her “gentle giants.”\n“I had wanted to give them something bigger.”\nThe family will soon be moving into a four-bedroom home, her boys, sister, brother and father assisting with the frame-up of the home.\n“When we started and my dad (Gene Novak of Deer River) came I took of video of him walking down the hall. We were really close. He passed away in July. I was hoping he’d be here to see us move in. But he will be here in spirit. He would want to be where his boys are,” Novak said of her sons, who are excited to have their own rooms.\n“Moving in will be emotional,” she said. “I can’t wait to decorate. And I hope to put in a decent vegetable garden (tomatoes and cucumbers grew in pots on her deck). I can visualize the yard... with sunflowers and morning glories.\n“We will be needing furniture (including dressers for the boys’ rooms). It will come when it comes,” she reasons. “I’m just so thankful to be in here.”\nRodriquez shares similar sentiments.\n“As a mother, I feel grateful and blessed,” she said, but admits to being a bit nervous as a first-time home owner. She also grabbed a paint brush and assisted with construction tasks.\nRodriquez, a home school family liaison, is hoping to celebrate Thanksgiving in her new home with children Amiya, 14. Rico, 11, and Mary Jane, who’s 1.\nOnce the homes are completed, Habitat for Humanity will sell them to the families using a zero percent interest mortgage, with affordable mortgage payments that include tax and insurance escrows.",
