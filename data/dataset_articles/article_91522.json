  "text": "County approves stricter noise ordinance\nPublished 12:07 am Thursday, October 9, 2025\nSALISBURY — The Rowan County Board of Commissioners approved a new noise ordinance on Monday in an effort to keep up with increasing development in the community.\nThe new noise ordinance restricts the noise created only by amplified sound, parties or gatherings or explosions between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. Noise from these sources is illegal according to the new ordinance if it is plainly audible to a responding deputy at a distance of 100 feet.\nThe ordinance also sets increasing penalties for continued noncompliance within 30 days. The first offense results in a written warning, the second in a $100 fine, the third in a $300 fine and the fourth and subsequent offenses in $500 fines. The penalties increase after an hour and reset after 30 days.\nThere are several exemptions written into the ordinance, including exemptions for farming activity; parades, protests or “other public demonstrations protected by the U.S. Constitution as federal law;” fireworks on holidays; athletic events; and the discharging of firearms.\nCommissioner Mike Caskey raised some concern about the enforceability of the new noise ordinance. He said that if someone decided to challenge the deputy in court, it would essentially be the accused’s word versus the deputy’s, and that he did not want the deputies “spinning their wheels” in court.\nMuire said that his main hope was that the ordinance change itself, along with the threat of fines, would “compel compliance.”\n“We would hope that 90 percent of what we visit is ‘oh, we didn’t realize it was too loud, we’ll turn it down’ or ‘we didn’t realize we had a noise ordinance, we’re good.’ In the situations that it doesn’t address that, this ordinance is probably one step in what would need to happen to bring them into compliance,” said County Planning Director Ed Muire, also noting that Rowan County Sheriff’s Office Chief Deputy Jason Owens had provided input on and approved of the proposed ordinance.\nThe change started in March at the request of the commissioners, several of whom expressed concern that the county’s previous noise ordinance was too minimal for the current development.\n“My concern is that this county is changing rapidly. The farmland we used to have, my grandfather lived in Cleveland and had 600 acres and that’s where he’d hunt. It was his property and nobody would complain because he didn’t have any neighbors. Well, it ain’t going to be that way anymore. So, I think it’s time we got proactive with this and put some guidelines in place so we’re not here every two years having to change,” said Commissioner Craig Pierce at a previous meeting.\nPreviously, the county’s noise ordinance was very minimalist, Muire has said, only stating that it is unlawful to operate sound equipment emitting “sound that is unreasonable.” The ordinance was in effect all 24 hours of the day and left the issue “solely up to the discretion of the responding officer as to whether or not it constitutes an unreasonable sound,” he said.\nFollowing the discussion, the commissioners voted unanimously to approve the new ordinance. Chairman Greg Edds was not present at the meeting.",
