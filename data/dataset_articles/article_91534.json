  "text": "Affluent Americans increased giving 30 percent since 2015, study finds\nEven though fewer affluent Americans are giving, their donations have increased by 30 percent over the past decade, a report from Bank of America Private Bank and the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy finds.\nBased on a nationally representative sample of 1,514 wealthy U.S. households, the report, the 2025 Bank of America Study of Philanthropy (103 pages, PDF), found that total charitable contributions from affluent donors in 2024 was more than 10 times higher than that of the general population. Yet participation in giving has reduced, with 81 percent making charitable donations in 2024, down from 91 percent in 2015. According to the report, on average, donors gave to five organizations in 2024, with 79 percent supporting groups in their local communities. The causes to which the largest percentages of donors gave were basic needs (43 percent) and religious services and development (38 percent). Religious organizations also attracted the highest share of dollars (39 percent), followed by organizations focused on basic needs (16 percent) and higher education (14 percent). In addition, this year’s report found an increase in volunteering, rising from 30 percent in 2020 to 43 percent in 2024.\nAccording to the report, more than 40 percent of affluent donors reported developing a giving strategy, 45 percent had a giving budget, and 20 percent actively monitored the impact of their gifts. On average, those who identify as expert givers awarded at least six times more than those who identify as novices. In 2024, 18 percent of charitable gifts were made through giving vehicles—up from 11 percent nine years earlier—and 48 percent of affluent households with a net worth between $5 million and $20 million have or plan to establish a giving vehicle within the next three years.\nRegarding how charitable decisions are made, 46 percent of affluent households reported making charitable decisions jointly with their spouse or partner, while an additional 11 percent said they collaborate on some giving decisions. However, only 13 percent of donors report involving children, grandchildren, or younger relatives.\n“Through this study, we illuminate how affluent donors, advisors and nonprofit organizations navigate today’s changing philanthropy landscape,” said Lilly Family School of Philanthropy dean Amir Pasic. “In particular, personal connection and in-depth knowledge are central to the higher levels of engagement with their giving and with nonprofits that we see among more generous donors.”\n(Photo credit: Getty Images/Jacob Wackerhausen)",
