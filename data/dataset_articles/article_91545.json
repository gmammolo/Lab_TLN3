  "text": "Donation Announcement by Kim NamGil and Seo Kyungdeok On October 9, 2025, renowned actor Kim NamGil and Professor Seo Kyungdeok from Sungshin Women’s University announced a significant donation of educational supplies to the Jaemontelai Hangul School in Mexico. This initiative is part of their ongoing effort to promote the Korean language and support educational institutions teaching Hangul around the world.\nContinuing a Noble Tradition This donation marks the fourth in a series of contributions made by Kim NamGil and Seo Kyungdeok. Their previous donations include support for the Grutugi Hangul School in New York, USA, the Kannan Sadang Hangul Cultural School in Vancouver, Canada, and the Hangul Learning Center in Budapest, Hungary. Each of these donations emphasizes their commitment to the ‘Hangul Globalization Campaign’, which aims to bolster Korean language education in foreign countries.\nGoals of the Hangul Globalization Campaign The primary goal of the Hangul Globalization Campaign is to support weekend schools and study groups for foreigners learning Korean. As the popularity of K-culture, including K-pop and K-drama, continues to rise globally, initiatives like these serve to enhance awareness and appreciation of the Korean language.\nUpcoming Cultural Festival In addition to their donation efforts, Kim NamGil and Seo Kyungdeok are also participating in promoting the upcoming 2025 Korean Language Festival. This cultural event celebrates the excellence of Hangul and aims to engage audiences around the world in the richness of Korean culture and education.\nImpact on Korean Education The contributions made by Kim NamGil and Professor Seo Kyungdeok have a profound impact on Korean education worldwide. By providing educational materials to institutions and raising awareness about the importance of learning Korean, they contribute significantly to fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of Korean language and culture among non-Korean speakers.\nFor more information on their initiatives, visit the [Jae Monterey Korean School](https://jaemontereykoreanschool.org) or explore related efforts in K-culture and K-drama.",
