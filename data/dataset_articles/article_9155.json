  "text": "Avalanche Creek Gorge 4.23.16. (Photo by NPS / Jacob W. Frank) Three visitors to Glacier National Park are in stable condition after falling into Avalanche Creek on Sunday, park officials said Tuesday in a news release. Shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday, park dispatch received multiple satellite SOS reports stating that individuals had fallen into Avalanche Creek, and CPR was being performed on two of the individuals. A group of four visitors from Florida were gathering for a photo on the rocks above Avalanche Gorge when one individual slipped and fell into the water, and a second and third person trying to help also fell in, according to Glacier. Two of the individuals were swept through the gorge while one was able to grab ahold of tree branches in the gorge, waiting for help, the release said. Rangers who responded found both individuals who had been swept through the gorge to be responsive, as bystanders performing CPR were successful in resuscitating them, the park said. It wasn’t immediately clear how the individuals were removed from the creek or the number of bystanders on scene who came to their aid. The first ranger on scene was informed of the individual who was trapped in the gorge. The ranger was able to rappel to the individual and secure them while the technical rescue team was assembled and retrieved both the individual and the ranger, according to Glacier. All patients were transported to Logan Health in Kalispell, the park said. One patient was transported by ALERT, the second patient by Three Rivers Ambulance, and the third patient by Whitefish Ambulance. All members involved are in stable condition, according to the release. Drowning is the number one cause of death in Glacier National Park, according to park officials, and visitors are reminded to watch their surroundings near water. “Swift, cold glacial streams and rivers, slick rocks or slippery logs all present dangers. Never walk, play, or climb on slippery rocks and logs, especially around waterfalls,” the news release warned. In the news release, park officials thanked visitors “for their heroic efforts” that saved two lives, as well as Three Rivers Ambulance, ALERT and the Whitefish Fire Department.",
