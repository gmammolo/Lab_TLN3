  "text": "The annual Tangipahoa Parish Fair remained a success this year with new and traditional events happening at a nearby but novel location.\nFair President Wendy Carrier noted that the fair’s different location created an air of anticipation and that “everybody was excited to see what the change was” in the setup.\n“The last two years we’ve been in front of the arena. We sold our old grounds that we originally had about four years ago to Hood [Memorial] Hospital and we built a new building that’s an event center for us, which is across the road from the Florida Parishes Arena,” Carrier said.\nFor next year, the fair president said she knows what to work on with the new location, including continued building and improvement on the fair’s pioneer town and moving craft vendors toward the front of the grounds to draw people in.\n“They were kind of hidden this year with the new setup, so I think it would be a better advantage for them to be in the front of the facility,” she said.\nThe fair still pulled its average crowd of about 18,000 to 22,000, with expected lower numbers on Friday due to some citizens’ frustration with the Town of Amite. Carrier said the town did not allow Amite High Magnet School alumni to have a street party, causing claims that some would boycott the fair and Amite Oyster Festival.\nCarrier said the fair is not part of any municipality and works as a nonprofit organization; any and every dollar that’s made is either used to keep the fair afloat or reenters the community in some capacity.\n“For the most part, our numbers were really good. Our vendors were happy; they all sold out of food so that’s always a good sign,” Carrier said.\nA couple new vendors included The Backyard Boil LLC and Bayou Bubbles and Bites.\nAlong with the new location, Tangipahoa Parish Fair for the first time acted as the initial location for the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association’s participants to gain points before heading to compete in Las Vegas.\nThe fair’s traditional carnival hosted a few new rides, with the fair president noting the continued popularity of “The Rocket” ride.\nCarrier invites everyone to join the Tangipahoa Parish Fair in 2026 during the first full weekend in October.\n“We have so many people that support us and back us throughout the year with sponsorships and donations and we couldn’t do it without them, and I think that’s our backbone. Of course the citizens of the parish are in our mission, and as long as we’re able to continue putting money back out into the community, I will call the fair a success,” Carrier said.\nUp next for Tangipahoa Parish Fair is its selection of the 2026 royalty on Sunday, Oct. 12, at their new building on the fairgrounds.",
