  "text": "Huawei‘s Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance (HIMA) recorded strong order figures during the 2025 National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holiday period from October 1 to 8, with cumulative firm orders across all models exceeding 48,500 units, according to data shared by automotive blogger @我鸿 on Weibo, China’s version of X.\nDaily statistics showed steady growth throughout the eight-day break. On October 1, orders surpassed 8,000 units; by October 3, the total had reached 18,500 units, including 5,800 for the Aito M7, 2,700 for the Luxeed R7, 2,100 for the Shangjie H5, and 1,500 for the Stelato S9T. The figure continued to climb to 30,000 by October 5 and 41,300 by October 7, before closing the holiday period above 48,500.\nThe newly launched Aito M7 was the primary contributor, securing over 15,000 orders, which accounted for roughly 31% of the total volume. The model is built on the same platform as the M8 and M9 and features a 3,030 mm wheelbase for increased interior space. It is equipped with Huawei’s ADS 4.0 intelligent driving system, with most variants including lidar for city-level map-free driving. The model lineup also offers adaptive damping control (CDC), dual-chamber air suspension, multiple infotainment screens, and upgraded seating configurations.\nOther models also made significant contributions to the total. The Aito M8 recorded 8,934 orders (23% share), the Luxeed R7 achieved 6,551, the Shangjie H5 5,388, the Aito M9 3,933, and the Stelato S9T 3,810.\nThe National Day results followed a strong performance in September, when Harmony Intelligent Mobility delivered 52,916 vehicles and achieved more than 110,000 firm orders, setting a new monthly record. Cumulative deliveries across all models have now exceeded 950,000 units, bringing the brand closer to the one million milestone.",
