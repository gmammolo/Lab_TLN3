  "text": "Cybercrime & Fraud- 4 min read\nBuilding cyber resilience in Indian enterprises with passkeys and AI\nIndian enterprises are charging ahead with digital transformation. Cloud-first projects, UPI, online banking, e-commerce, hybrid workplaces; there’s hardly a sector untouched by this shift. But growth has a shadow. Every new platform, every new endpoint, is another doorway for attackers. The more digital we become, the more exposed we are.\nThe evidence is not abstract. IBM’s 2025 report put the average cost of a breach in India at ₹220 million—the highest ever recorded here. Phishing remains the top entry point, with over 80 million attempts detected last year, second only to the US. The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board’s breach, triggered by a single exposed admin password, risked the data of 300,000 residents. It showed, brutally, how little it takes to compromise trust at scale.\nWhy Passwords Are Failing Indian Businesses\nFor decades, passwords have been the front-door key to digital systems. But that key is flimsy. It’s shared, duplicated, stolen, and reused. And once it’s out, it opens more doors than it should.The dark web today holds millions of Indian credentials, some tied to government services, some to banks, some to enterprise systems. In 2023, even thousands of Indian ChatGPT accounts were found leaked, raising alarms about exposure of enterprise data. The truth is simple: passwords were built for a different era of cyber risk. They are no longer sufficient for securing modern, digital-first enterprises.\nWhat Are Passkeys?\nPasskeys are the next-generation alternative to passwords—simpler, safer, and phishing-resistant. Instead of remembering and reusing credentials, users authenticate with device biometrics (like Touch ID or Face ID) or a FIDO security key.Here’s how they work:\n- A public key is stored by the website or application.\n- A private key stays securely on the user’s device.\n- During login, the two keys communicate to verify identity—without exposing secrets.\nAI as the Force Multiplier in Enterprise Security\nSecuring identity is one piece of the puzzle. Threats today move faster than any manual process can keep up with. AI changes the game by acting as a force multiplier, scanning vast amounts of activity, spotting patterns humans might miss, and intervening before incidents spiral.We’re already seeing this in practice. Indian banks use AI to flag fraudulent transactions in real time. Telecom providers deploy models to detect SIM-swap scams targeting mobile banking users. Inside enterprises, AI has shrunk the time it takes to detect and contain breaches, from weeks to minutes, turning potential crises into manageable incidents.\nThe real strength of AI lies in partnership. It doesn’t replace human expertise; it extends it. By working alongside existing systems, AI gives security teams visibility and speed they could never achieve on their own. The result is a defence posture that not only catches threats early but also responds faster and learns continuously.\nWhat Resilience Really Means\nTrue resilience is the ability to keep going even when attacked. That means anticipating threats, containing them quickly, and recovering without breaking business continuity.Passkeys remove the weakest link in authentication. AI keeps constant watch for unusual behaviour. Together, they form a stronger baseline. But resilience also depends on people. Employees must recognize phishing, practice safe browsing, and understand their role in protecting data.\nIt also depends on trust. With the Digital Personal Data Protection Act now active, enterprises cannot compromise on privacy. Customers expect security and convenience at the same time. Passkeys and AI make that balance possible.\nWhat’s Next\nIndia’s digital economy is projected to hit $1 trillion by 2030. That growth cannot be secured by tools designed for another era. Passwords belong to the past. The future is passwordless authentication, real-time intelligence, and a mindset that puts resilience at the center of digital operations.Cybersecurity Awareness Month should not be treated as a ritual reminder. It is an opportunity to reset, to move from a defensive posture to one that is proactive, adaptive, and built for the scale of India’s digital ambitions. Enterprises that make this shift will not only secure their operations but also win the trust that is essential to the country’s growth story.\nThe author is Chandramouli Dorai, Chief Evangelist, Cyber Solutions & Digital Signatures, Zoho.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed are solely of the author and ETCISO does not necessarily subscribe to it.
