  "text": "“Their music brilliantly encapsulates flamboyant technical prowess, boundless imagination and instant melodic appeal.”—The Journal of Music\nThe internationally acclaimed Nordic trio Dreamers’ Circus will perform at the University of Georgia Performing Arts Center’s Hodgson Concert Hall on Tuesday, October 28 at 7:30 p.m. as part of the UGA Presents ’25-’26 season.\nHailed as one of Denmark’s leading musical ensembles, Dreamers’ Circus — featuring Rune Tonsgaard Sørensen on violin and other instruments, Nikolaj Busk on accordion, piano, and synthesizers, and Ale Carr on cittern, violin, and more — reimagines the sound of Nordic folk music for a new era. Their performances blend traditional roots with contemporary flair, infusing folk sensibility with classical sophistication, jazz improvisation, and even pop energy.\nFifteen years after first meeting at a jam session in Copenhagen, the three musicians have forged a sound described by critics as “spellbinding” and “joyously inventive.” The group’s live performances are known for their spontaneity — no two shows are alike — and for their ability to connect deeply with audiences through dynamic interplay and musical storytelling.\n“We view our roots in the rich traditions of Danish and Swedish folk music as a point of departure and refuse to accept tradition as a straitjacket,” the trio explains. “Our name hints at the possibilities and magic of the imagination and we hope that you will open yourself up to the colors and images we seek to create with our soundscapes.”\nEach member of the trio brings exceptional musical credentials to the stage. Sørensen, also a founding member of the Grammy-nominated Danish String Quartet, was concertmaster of the Copenhagen Philharmonic in his early twenties. Busk is a sought-after composer and arranger whose versatility spans folk, jazz, and pop. Carr, raised in a family of Swedish folk musicians, is recognized as one of Scandinavia’s foremost innovators on plucked string instruments.\nThis concert is part of the “Nordic Dream: Voices from Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden” series within the UGA Presents World Stage calendar, offering Athens audiences a chance to engage with music from northern Europe that is both ancient and forward-looking.\nBUYING TICKETS IS EASY\nSecuring tickets for UGA Presents performances couldn’t be easier. There are three ways to choose from:\n- Purchase tickets online 24/7\nhere. - Call the Performing Arts Center Box Office at (706) 542-4400, Mon.-Fri., 10:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m.\n- Visit the UGA Performing Arts Center Box Office, Mon.-Fri., 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (5 minute parking is available in the drop off circle at the Performing Arts Center for purchasing or picking up tickets.)\nYou may also create your own series of three or more performances (10% off).
