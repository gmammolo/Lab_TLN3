(S. Forde-Craigg/BGIS)\nThe Embassy of Colombia has launched a Spanish Language Course for Barbadian public officers, aimed at strengthening cultural ties, improving communication, and enhancing global competitiveness across the public service.\nSpeaking at the launch ceremony at the Learning and Development Unit, Warrens, St. Michael, Acting Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, Joy-Ann Skinner, said the initiative was about broadening horizons, deepening understanding of other cultures, and equipping the Barbados Public Service with the tools it needs to thrive in an increasingly interconnected world.\nMs. Skinner noted that the re-establishment of a resident Embassy of Colombia in Bridgetown “has opened a new chapter in our bilateral relationship”, creating opportunities for deeper cooperation in trade and investment, education and culture, security and climate resilience, and international transport and tourism.\nShe described the resumption of the Spanish Language Programme as “timely, strategic, and a way of breaking down barriers and building bridges”.\n“If we are to unlock opportunities for our citizens, whether in business, in diplomacy, or in cultural exchange, then we must empower them with the ability to converse, to negotiate, and to connect in the languages of our hemisphere. This is about more than grammar or vocabulary; it is about creating new pathways for trade with non-traditional partners, for collaboration with new allies, and for friendships that enrich us all,” she said.\nActing Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Training and Tertiary Education, Patrick McCaskie, described the course as “an investment in human capital, stronger bilateral ties, and in the economic empowerment of Barbadians”.\n“Research has consistently shown that learning a second language enhances memory, decision-making, and adaptability. More importantly, it increases employability, cultural sensitivity, and labour market competitiveness.\n“In today’s global economy, bilingualism is not a luxury, it is a necessity. Employers worldwide increasingly value bilingual staff, recognising the advantages for trade, diplomacy, and international business,” he said.\nAmbassador of Colombia to Barbados, Elizabeth Taylor Jay, said the programme marked “a significant milestone in more than 50 years of bilateral relations”, reaffirming Colombia’s commitment to foster partnerships that benefit both nations.\n“By strengthening language skills, we are also strengthening communication, mutual understanding and forms of cooperation that unite our two nations today. I encourage each of the participants to fully engage in this three-month programme. May it be a valuable journey of learning, and may it open doors of opportunity for Barbados and Colombia alike,” she stated.\nFifty-nine participants from various ministries and agencies, including the Best-dos Santos Public Health Laboratory and the National Disabilities Unit, are enrolled in the programme. The initiative is a collaboration between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, the Ministry of Training and Tertiary Education, and the Embassy of Colombia.\nAuthor: Dionne Best\nSource: https://gisbarbados.gov.bb/blog/colombias-embassy-launches-spanish-course-for-public-officers/",
