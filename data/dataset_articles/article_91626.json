It protects the democratic rights of the people, keeping law enforcement accountable and responsive to Utah’s communities … supporting a system where sheriffs are elected by the people, for the people, and remain directly accountable to their communities.” Glover was also commended for his leadership role in the Sheriffs Association’s recent calls for ICE to improve local cooperation before deploying local law enforcement in their operations.\nThis award follows close on the heels of Glover receiving a similar Sheriff of the Year title from the Western States Sheriffs Association, which Sheriff Glover serves as Vice President.\nSheriff Glover stated on this recent award, “Receiving an award like this is a humbling experience, especially from sheriffs across the state for whom I have great respect. Serving the sheriffs at the statewide level and serving the people of Kane County on a local level has been the experience of a lifetime.”",
