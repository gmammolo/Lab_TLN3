  "text": "News\nOctober 9, 2025 by\nJuliana Agbo\n‘How Amnesty drives peace, innovation in Niger Delta’\nNational advocacy group, Polivox, has hailed the transformation in Niger Delta under Dr. Dennis Otuaro, saying his approach is a strategic reintegration model reshaping the regionand reinforcing security.\nIn a statement: “From Arms to Algorithms: How Otuaro’s Stewardship Is Scripting a New Future for Niger Delta,” the group said Otuaro, who heads Presidential Amnesty Programme, has moved the region from pacification to prosperity in line with President Bola Tinubu’s Renewed Hope.\nOtuaro inherited a programme at a crossroads, but he introduced “Otuaro Doctrine” a shift from stipends to investment in education and sustainable entrepreneurship.\n“This is not just about giving a man a fish, or even teaching him how to fish,” a senior official explained.\n“It is about training him to master marine engineering, aquaculture technology, and global export logistics.\nRead Also: Nigerian Navy, French, regional allies hold joint exercise for improved security\nDr. Otuaro sees these former agitators and youths not as beneficiaries, but as future architects of Niger Delta’s economic diversification.”\nThe statement said Amnesty has deployed more than 160 international scholars in 2025 to study Cybersecurity, Data Science, Marine Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and Renewable Energy, with hundreds of onshore students in Nigerian universities.\nPolivox said these investments are strategic measures, arguing that turning former agitators into engineers and data scientists helps dismantle the foundations of unrest and build a lasting culture of peace.\nIt noted peace and stability under Otuaro have raised oil output and national revenue.",
