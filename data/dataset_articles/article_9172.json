Despite limited mobile coverage, the soldiers have maintained constant updates with the civil administration, working shoulder-to-shoulder with the SDRF, NDRF, and local officials.\nNotably, it isn’t just supplies that arrived, but also doctors. In makeshift tents set up next to collapsed homes, army medics are treating everything, including the provision of first aid and distribution of ration kits to affected families.\nIn partnership with civil administration, the Army has ensured the delivery of relief material to remote villages cut off by the flood. Aid has already reached Degi (July 7), Rushad (July 8), and Chapad (July 9).\nAll columns are in communication via mobile networks, with limited coverage at some locations like Thunag.\nSatellite communications, including ISAT phone, RS STARSV and HX systems, have been provided to ensure uninterrupted operational connectivity.\nThe Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh, Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, is scheduled to visit Thunag to assess the ongoing relief operations.\nSimilarly, the Brigade Commander is also visiting Mandi for an operational update and interaction with the relief columns.\nA meeting with the Chief Minister and Deputy Commissioner, Mandi, is also planned to enhance coordination and response.\nThe Indian Army said it remains committed to supporting the citizens of Himachal Pradesh during this crisis and continues to stand by the civil administration in its time of need.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",
