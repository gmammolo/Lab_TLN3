  "text": "Here’s How You Can Help Victims of Texas Floods\nShare News:\nThe devastating floods that swept through the Texas Hill Country have left families grieving, homes destroyed, and communities reeling. Right now, our community is in deep pain, grieving the tragic loss of life. As bystanders who can’t be there in the Hill Country to help, one of our rituals in times of loss is giving.\nBut already, Texans are showing up — even with a simple green ribbon tied around a tree. H-E-B (founded in Kerrville) is on the ground delivering hot meals to rescue workers and distributing free disaster aid kits filled with snacks, cleaning supplies, and gift cards. The Dallas Cowboys, Houston Texans, and the NFL have pledged $1.5 million to relief efforts. Retailers from Tiff’s Treats to jewelers Kendra Scott and James Avery (also founded in Kerrville) have pitched in, with more sure to follow.\nWe’ve assembled this list of trusted organizations currently providing support to flood victims, rescue teams, and displaced families. We’ll continue updating this list as we find more donation opportunities, so feel free to share additional resources with us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).\nFinancial Donations & Relief Funds\nCommunity Foundation\nKerr County officials have said donating to the Community Foundation is one of the best ways to directly help fund recovery efforts. Their Flood Relief Fund will support nonprofit organizations, first responder agencies, and local governments actively involved in response, relief, and recovery efforts.\nTexas Search and Rescue (TexSar)The volunteer first-responder organization has deployed swiftwater rescue teams, boats, drones, and search dogs to aid in the search for the missing. They’re raising funds for PPEs, meals, lodging, and supplies for first-responder volunteers.\nH-E-B Spirit of Giving\n100% of donations support Kerrville, Hill Country communities, and all Texas flood victims. H-E-B notes: “We can add a donation to your Curbside order — just let us know.”\nVolunteer Opportunities & Support Services\nSamaritan’s Purse Disaster Relief\nVolunteers help with content recovery, debris cleanup, and mud-out services in Kerr County. You can serve as an overnight volunteer with meals and lodging provided (minimum three-day commitment), or sign up as a day volunteer if you can arrange your own accommodations.\nInformation Technology Disaster Resource CenterInformation Technology Disaster Resource Center is accepting IT-skilled volunteers for the Disaster Tech Task Force. Volunteers form a remote response team for help desk support, GIS and mapping, networking, and systems engineering.\nAdditional Resources\nDriveTexas.org – Real-time road conditions including flooded roadwaysTexasFlood.org – Resources for understanding flood eventsReady.gov – Flood Safety Tips",
