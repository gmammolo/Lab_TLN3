  "text": "Miracle in Wilmington: All 31 Trapped Workers Rescued After Dramatic Tunnel Collapse\nDiscover how over 100 LAFD heroes pulled off a miraculous rescue, saving 31 workers from a deep underground tunnel collapse in Wilmington, Los Angeles. Get the full story on this dramatic incident and the massive effort involved.\nMiracle in Wilmington: All 31 Trapped Workers Rescued After Dramatic Tunnel Collapse\nA massive sigh of relief swept across Los Angeles last night as all 31 workers trapped following a dramatic tunnel collapse in Wilmington were successfully rescued. The incident, which unfolded around 8 p.m. Wednesday, triggered a swift and extensive emergency response, culminating in a triumphant outcome with no injuries reported.\nThe harrowing ordeal saw construction workers brought to the surface in groups of eight, hoisted to safety by a crane operating at the bustling construction site. The efficiency and coordination of the rescue effort were nothing short of remarkable.\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass wasted no time in mobilizing city resources, taking to X (formerly Twitter) to commend the efforts. \"The City of Los Angeles has mobilized resources to the tunnel collapse in Wilmington,\" Mayor Bass wrote. \"More than 100 LAFD responders have been deployed, including Urban Search and Rescue teams. Thank you to all of those who are acting immediately to respond to this emergency.\" Her words underscored the gravity of the situation and the city's unwavering commitment to the trapped individuals.\nThe collapse occurred within the ambitious $630.5 million Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel project, a vital undertaking commissioned by the Los Angeles County Sanitation District. This critical infrastructure project, aimed at bolstering the region's wastewater management, has been under construction by prime contractor Flatiron Dragados. According to the company's website, the colossal tunnel stretches an impressive seven miles, boasts an approximate diameter of 18 feet, and lies a staggering 450 feet underground – a testament to the immense engineering challenges involved.\nWhile Flatiron Dragados reportedly aims for a 2027 completion, documents from the Los Angeles County Sanitation Department, dated July 2024 and obtained by CBS News, indicated that tunneling was originally slated for completion by this year. The discrepancy in timelines raises questions about potential delays or unforeseen complexities within the project.\nInitial reports from the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) on Wednesday night indicated that as many as 15 tunnel workers were isolated by the \"collapse\" near the intersection of W. Lomita Boulevard and S. Figueroa Street. The LAFD's rapid deployment of over 100 responders, including highly specialized Urban Search and Rescue team members trained in confined space tunnel rescues, proved instrumental in the successful operation.\nVideo footage from the scene painted a vivid picture of the massive emergency response, with flashing lights and a flurry of activity underscoring the urgency of the situation. While the exact cause and detailed dimensions of the tunnel at the point of collapse are still under investigation, the paramount concern was the safety of the workers, a mission that was flawlessly executed. This incident serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks in large-scale infrastructure projects and the incredible bravery of the first responders who stand ready to face them.",
