  "text": "Dozens of workers were pulled to safety Wednesday after an industrial tunnel collapsed in Los Angeles' Wilmington neighborhood, the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) said.\nThe collapse was reported just before 8 p.m. near the intersection of South Figueroa Street and Q Street.\nWatch NBC6 free wherever you are\n WATCH HERE\nAs many as 31 tunnel workers were rescued and accounted for following the collapse, according to the officials. Twenty-seven of the 31 workers were being medically evaluated, according to the LAFD Chief Ronnie Villanueva.\nWorkers were operating a tunnel boring machine, used to excavate tunnels, when the structure partially collapsed. Fire officials say when the loose dirt fell, it was over 15 feet high.\nGet local news you need to know to start your day with NBC 6's News Headlines newsletter.\nSIGN UP\n\"It was determined that a structure failure of the tunnel line failed approximately 5 to 6 miles in...\" said Villanueva. \"The workers had to climb through debris. They had to make themselves out through and then rescuers actually came to them to assist them out.\"\nMore than 100 LAFD first responders were assigned to assist. Search and Rescue teams were also activated to help with confined tunnel rescues.\n\"I was so concerned that we were going to find tragedy. Instead, what we found was victory. All of the men that were in that tunnel, rescued,\" said LA Mayor Karen Bass at a press conference late Wednesday.\nWorkers were brought up in groups of 8 using a crane at the construction site. NewsChopper captured workers hugging in relief as they were brought back up to the surface.\nThe tunnel construction is part of the Clear Water Project, an investment meant to help modernize wastewater infrastructure, according to Congresswoman Nanette Barragán. The 7-mile-long tunnel is being constructed about 200 feet underground and is expected to end at Royal Palms Beach in San Pedro.",
