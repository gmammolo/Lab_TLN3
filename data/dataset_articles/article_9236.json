  "text": "(Reuters) -All 31 workers have been rescued after an industrial tunnel collapsed in Los Angeles' Wilmington area, city officials said late on Wednesday.\nThe tunnel that collapsed had a diameter of 18 ft (5.5 m) and was being constructed for municipal wastewater management, the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) said in a statement.\n\"LAFD has just reported that all workers who were trapped in the tunnel in Wilmington are now out and accounted for. I just spoke with many of the workers who were trapped. Thank you to all of our brave first responders who acted immediately,\" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a post on X.\nThe collapse happened about six miles (10 km) south of the tunnel's only access, LAFD said, adding that more than 100 responders were assigned to the incident.\n(Reporting by Gnaneshwar Rajan in Bengaluru; Editing by Jacqueline Wong, Kim Coghill and Jamie Freed)\nCopyright 2025 Thomson Reuters .\nJoin the Conversation See Comments\nRead More",
