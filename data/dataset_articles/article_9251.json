  "text": "CARNATION, Wash. — In response to the deadly flash floods in Texas, King County leaders are taking proactive measures to prevent a similar disaster.\nThe King County Flood Control District Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a motion to enhance flood preparedness and community awareness.\nThis is my worst fear for this community to have flooding like this,\" said King County Councilmember Reagan Dunn. \"To make sure we’re doing everything we can to make sure if something like this were to happen here, that we are the best prepared to handle it.\nRELATED: Texas officials defend quick response to flooding as number of missing hits triple-digits\nThe approved motion calls for a review of the county’s early warning systems, increased community outreach, and the distribution of flood preparedness videos and updated brochures in multiple languages. The initiative aims to improve flood risk reduction and expand educational efforts.\nJulia Moreno, a lifelong resident of Carnation, emphasized the importance of preparedness.\n\"Roads will close, we’ll have to find a new route from work and school, and home, and it's just something you learn to live with, is the flooding,\" Moreno said. \"There could be more preparedness for sure.\"\nRussell Hartwig, another Carnation resident, expressed appreciation for the county's efforts.\nALSO SEE: Texas flooding: 161 people missing in Kerr County as state death toll rises above 100\n\"I appreciate all the effort the county has put in for flood awareness and flood mitigation, and they’ve done quite a bit of both here,\" said Hartwig.\nKing County has faced 29 federally declared flood disasters since 1956, with smaller events occurring nearly every year. Officials stress that the focus is on preparedness, not panic.\nOur hearts are with the residents of the Texas Hill Country as they grieve the lives lost and begin the long road to recovery,\" Dunn said. \"Their tragedy is a sobering reminder of the importance of preparedness.\nFor more information on King County’s flood safety programs, click here.",
