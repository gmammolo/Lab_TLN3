  "text": "FRESNO COUNTY, Calif. ( KSEE/KGPE ) – It’s been nearly five years since the Creek Fire, and many parts of the Shaver Lake area are still in the process of rebuilding. Cressman’s General Store is a Sierra landmark that’s been around long enough to see everything from horse-drawn buggies to modern-day cars. It opened in 1904, where it stood for over a century until the Creek Fire destroyed it in 2020. But now, construction on a new building is officially underway. For more than four years, the store operated out of a cargo container after the original structure burned down. “This was our local general store. Everybody ran here on Thanksgiving to get cranberry sauce, pumpkin spice… we were always here for them,” said Melissa McLaren. McLaren has worked at Cressman’s for 16 years. She says as soon as construction started, the excitement was instant. “We’ve got generations coming up here for years and years. They’d always stop for sandwiches and cookies. They’re just really excited.” McLaren continued. The new store will feature a full kitchen and BBQ, bringing back customer favorites like sandwiches and freshly baked goods. But while the rebuilding is a welcome sight, Fresno County Supervisor Nathan Magsig says many in the community are still struggling. “People have not been able to rebuild. Even those with insurance, the payouts often haven’t been enough. Another big challenge is insurance itself. Because we’ve had so many catastrophic wildfires, it’s nearly impossible to get coverage if you’re rebuilding in mountain areas,” said Magsig. Construction on Cressman’s new building is expected to be complete before next summer.
