  "text": "Disasters near and far have deepened the desire in many to help — to somehow do something amid all this suffering and struggle. In many of the hardest hit places, the American Red Cross is helping — and if we can’t be involved in those direct efforts, we can certainly do something to help that organization fulfill its mission.\nPart of that mission is, of course, keeping hospital shelves stocked with blood and blood products. The need for that never ceases. At the moment, the organization is asking especially for those with type O to donate blood, though all types are needed.\nSummer is a challenging time for organizations such as the Red Cross, which in this case depends upon people scheduling appointments or going to an event to give blood. Even if there were no holidays and vacations getting in the way, recent tragedies have stretched the organization’s resources thin and pulled potential donors’ attention to other needs.\nTry to refocus on a need that YOU can fulfill, very soon.\nUpcoming local blood drives include:\n• Thursday — Noon-6 p.m., Wildare Church, 7211 N. Park Ave. Ext., Warren\n• July 19 — 8 a.m.-2 p.m., Jewish Community Center, 505 Gypsy Lane, Youngstown\n• July 21 — 11 a.m.-5 p.m., Stambaugh Auditorium, 1000 Fifth Ave., Youngstown\n• July 22 — 11 a.m.-5 p.m., Austintown Library, 600 S. Raccoon Road, Austintown\n• July 23 — 1 p.m.-6 p.m., Immaculate Heart of Mary, 4500 Norquest Blvd., Austintown; Noon-6 p.m., St Patrick Catholic Church, 367 N. Main St., Hubbard\n• Friday, July 25 — 9 a.m.-2 p.m., Cortland United Methodist Church, 155 N. High St., Cortland\n• Saturday, July 26 — 8:30 a.m.-2 p.m., St. Paul Lutheran Church, 2860 East Market St., Warren\nAs always, there are incentives such as sunglasses or movie rewards, but the real incentive is knowing THIS is something you can do to help; and your gift might just save a life.\n“Scheduling and keeping donation appointments are crucial this month to ensure blood products are constantly available in the weeks to come for all patients, including those in trauma situations that may require several lifesaving transfusions,” the Red Cross said Monday.\nYou — yes, YOU — are needed. Make an appointment and roll up your sleeves.\nNewsletter Today's breaking news and more in your inbox Email (Required) I'm interested in (please check all that apply) (Required) Daily Newsletter Breaking News Obituaries Are you a paying subscriber to the newspaper?
