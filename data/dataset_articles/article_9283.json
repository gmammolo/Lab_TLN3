  "text": "The Governor of Kebbi State, Nasir Idris, has ordered the immediate reconstruction of the Makera-Kangiwa road, a key route linking his state to Niger State, after a major portion was washed away by recent flooding. Naija News reports that the governor gave the directive on Wednesday while inspecting the damaged portion in Makera, describing the road as a strategic economic corridor essential for both internal mobility and regional trade.\nIn a statement issued on Thursday by his Chief Press Secretary, Ahmed Idris, Governor Idris directed the state Ministry of Works to quickly identify and engage a competent contractor for the project.\n“This administration will not rest until critical infrastructure across the state is restored and expanded.\n“Our people deserve the dividends of democracy, and we are committed to delivering just that,” the governor declared.\nHe underscored the road’s economic relevance, especially to communities dependent on it for the movement of goods and services between Nigeria and neighbouring countries.\nAlso speaking during the inspection, Commissioner for Works, Alhaji Abdullahi Umar-Muslim , said the ministry had already begun the process of evaluating qualified contractors.\nHe said, “We understand the hardship this has caused, and we are moving swiftly to resolve it. His Excellency’s directive is clear: no delays, no excuses.”\nUmar-Muslim added that restoring the road would not only ease movement for affected communities but also re-establish a key trade link between Kebbi State and the wider West African sub-region.",
