  "text": "HAW RIVER, N.C. (WGHP) — Floodwaters rose fast in Haw River after Tropical Storm Chantal dumped heavy rainfall on the area, leading to water rescues as roads and homes filled with water. One of the hardest-hit areas was Fleming Road, where Back Creek quickly overflowed, covering streets and surrounding homes. The creek sits near Fleming Road and feeds into the Haw River. The flooding left yards looking like lakes and mailboxes barely sticking out above the waterline. Lisa Moize said the water rose fast. She and her husband had just moved their cars to higher ground, hoping to keep them safe from the flooding. “We went back in the house, and you can hear the water gurgling underneath the house, coming up through the vents … We swam out. My parents live further back off the road, and they’re in their seventies, and they had to … call 911, and it was not working. They finally sent us to Greensboro, and one of our friends … came over and took his boat back and got them out,” Moize said. Soon after, the water quickly rushed up to their home. She said their log cabin-style home has been there for three decades and was covered in several feet of water, and their cars were completely submerged. The couple had to swim away to escape the flooding. Scott Matthews lives just a few miles away. He said he expected the flooding would be bad the moment the heavy rain started Sunday afternoon. Matthews said he saw the road near his home washed away. On Monday, he’s been riding around the area, trying to check on people still dealing with what Tropical Storm Chantal left behind. “I actually got a friend who lives down here. He’s blocked in … We’re telling everybody to get out. I know there’s one house down there … Water was up to the roof,” Matthews said. Several Alamance County businesses are left to deal with the impacts left behind by Chantal. Businesses in Haw River, sitting near Back Creek, are dealing with major flood damage after water reached all the way up to their roofs. The backside of CKS Packaging Incorporated flooded as water from Back Creek rushed in, halting operations at the plant. On Monday afternoon, management said they’re already working to restart operations, but the damage is slowing things down. Nearby at D&S International, water had reached the roof, shattered windows and filled the inside with several feet of water Water could still be seen seeping out of the building’s bricks. Beside that sits 10 Federal Storage, where floodwaters covered multiple self-storage units. Yellow tape remains around its entrance. People who rent units have been showing up to check on their belongings. Ron Gergle said he’s been storing antiques and valuables there for over a year and is hoping his insurance covers what’s been damaged. “I got an email this morning, and it said that there was no access to the storage facility, so I thought I’d come and check out how extensive the damage might be … It seems like it pretty much flooded most of the storage buildings. I knew the river was near here, but I had no clue that it was in danger of a flood,” Gergle said. The Town of Haw River has officially declared a state of emergency in response to the damage.
