  "text": "A minor fire broke out in the Old Security Hold area of the Jayprakash Narayan International Airport in Patna on Thursday, officials said. The fire, which broke out near the airline ticketing counters, was promptly contained using on-site extinguishers. The Fire Control Room was immediately alerted by the CISF personnel and ATC Tower. According to airport officials, the fire broke out during steel-cutting work, caused by sparks from gas cutting, reported ANI. The Airport Fire Rescue Vehicle (AFRV) responded swiftly and brought the situation under control, they said. The airport director said in a statement that the fire had caused no damage or disruptions to airport operations. Aircraft movement also remained unaffected, he said. Patna Airport is the 20th busiest airport in India. The airport has not been handling any international operations since 1999 when the Indian Airlines Flight 814 was hijacked and taken to Kandahar on December 24. In May this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a new terminal which will accommodate 3,000 passengers at peak hours.",
