The European maritime mission Aspides announced the rescue of four more people who were on the sunken Greek cargo ship Eternity C in the Red Sea.\n\"On the night of July 9-10, three more crew members of Eternity C (Filipino citizens) and one person from the Maritime Security Service (Greek citizen) were extracted,\" the mission said in a statement. It is noted that a total of 10 people were rescued.\nEarlier, the British Navy's Maritime Trade Coordination Center reported that on July 7, the ship was hit by five shells fired from a grenade launcher. The next day, the attack from small motorboats continued, and the cargo ship was seriously damaged and lost steam. The incident occurred 51 nautical miles west of the Yemeni port city of Hodeidah.\nAccording to the Reuters news agency, at least four people were killed in the attack. On July 9, Aspides rescuers rescued six crew members from the waters of the Red Sea.\nYemeni Houthis from the Ansar Allah rebel movement claimed responsibility for the attack on the cargo ship.",
