  "text": "The Poseidon boat developed a mechanical fault in its exhaust pipe while returning from Koh Yao to Koh Khieo, causing water to flood in around 4:50 p.m., said Rewat Areerob, president of the Phuket Provincial Administration Organization (PAO), the Bangkok Post reported.\nA dive tour operator alerted the Khaimuk (Pearl) Tourist Assistance Center, triggering an urgent rescue. Patrol Boat 3 was quickly dispatched, safely evacuating all five tourists and transporting them back to Chalong Pier without injuries, The Nation reported.\nCrew members on the nearby Mermaid boat managed to seal the leak, preventing further flooding. The Poseidon was later towed back to shore by the Andaman Pearl 3 and Mermaid boats.",
