  "text": "Armed Forces extinguishing wildfires throughout the country\nAt the request of the Ministry of the Interior and local governments, the Serbian Armed Forces have urgently deployed a helicopter, fire trucks, water tankers and necessary personnel to extinguish fires that broke out in about a dozen locations throughout Serbia.\nExtremely unfavourable weather conditions caused a fire to burn out of control in the vicinity of Kragujevac, Prokuplje, on Tara mountain, as well as in the municipalities of Gornji Milanovac, Kuršumlija, Valjevo, Knić, Veliko Gradište and Bujanovac.\nA specialised helicopter is employed for extinguishing the fire near Prokuplje, while other assets were deployed to extinguishing tasks throughout Serbia.\nThrough joint efforts with the Ministry of the Interior fire and rescue units and other competent civilian structures, members of the Armed Forces managed to contain the wildfires on Tara and in the vicinity of Kuršumlija, while the fire is still being intensively extinguished at other locations.\nThe Serbian Armed Forces will continue to provide assistance to civil authorities in fighting the fires until the threat is completely eliminated.",
