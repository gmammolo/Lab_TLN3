  "text": "SAN ANTONIO – The Alamo Area Council of Governments (AACOG) is teaming up with the South Texas Blood and Tissue Center (STBTC) to host an emergency blood drive on Friday in an effort to help the victims of the Hill Country Floods.\nMore than one hundred deaths have occurred across the state as a result of severe flash flooding from the Fourth of July weekend.\nRecommended Videos\nAt least 173 people are currently known to be missing in Texas, according to the latest figures.\nThe emergency blood drive will be held on the first floor of the AACOG Tower Building on July 11 from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nThe AACOG Tower Building is at the 2700 block of NE Loop 410 near Perrin Beitel.\nAccording to a press release, interested donors can head to Room 134 (the San Antonio Room) on the first floor.\n“For those who are searching for a way to help our friends during this time of urgent need, the donation of precious blood is critical and truly lifesaving. Our state is known for Texans Supporting Texans, and together, we will unite to strengthen our communities in need,” said Cliff Herberg, AACOG Executive Director.\nAACOG said appointments are encouraged and can be scheduled by going to their website or scanning the QR code, pictured below.\nYou can also help at this drive by donating rewards points to disaster relief.\nAccording to a press release, those who give blood with STBTC receive Donor Rewards points as part of their Double Your Impact Program.\nThe points can be redeemed for various rewards, such as reusable water bottles or gifts, or donated to the Kerr County Relief Fund.\nThe Community Foundation, a 501(c) charity serving the Hill Country region, will direct funds toward recovery efforts for every point donated, according to the South Texas Blood & Tissue website. This includes organizations providing rescue, relief and flood assistance.",
