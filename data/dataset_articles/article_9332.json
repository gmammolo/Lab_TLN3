We found our lovely daughter who blessed us for 21 years!\"\nShe also expressed hope for the safe recovery of Joyce’s three friends, thanking everyone for their prayers and support.\n“We pray to be able to find her three friends soon. Thanks to EVERYONE for the prayers and support. God is good! ❤️❤️❤️,” she added.\nJoyce Catherine was staying with friends at a riverfront home in Hunt when tragedy struck\nAccording to Kellye Badon's Facebook page, her 21-year-old daughter, Joyce Catherine, an architecture major at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD), was staying with friends at a riverfront home in Hunt, Texas, when a sudden wall of water swept through the property after heavy overnight storms.\nKellye alerted 883 friends on Facebook about the unfolding emergency and asked for prayers. On July 4, she wrote, “We have an emergency & need prayers. Our daughter, Joyce Catherine, went to Hunt, TX for the 4th with friends. They were staying in a home on a hill along the river.\"\nDescribing the heartbreaking incident, she continued, “At 4am this morning, a flash flood came through and washed their cars away. It happened so quickly with so much water, they could not get in the attic.”\nKellye added, “The owner’s son, Aidan Heartfield, called his dad as it happened. Then, he & 2 others got washed away by debris. Joyce Catherine was the last person Thad Heartfield spoke to before the phone went dead.\"\nDespite the tragedy, Kellye expressed hope for her daughter’s survival, writing, “Ty, Nick, and I are on the way to Hunt. We pray for safety for JC & her friends. We are going to believe that we will pick up my daughter & her friends ALIVE in Hunt, TX today.\"",
