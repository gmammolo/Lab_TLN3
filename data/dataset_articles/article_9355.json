  "text": "The Indian Army has mobilised its columns across key locations in Himachal Pradesh to deliver relief material to remote villages cut off by the flood in the states Mandi district. Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu visited the districts Thunag area to assess the relief operations and shared photos of his visit in a post on X on Thursday. A brigade commander of the army is in Mandi for an operational update and interaction with the forces columns. A meeting with the chief minister and Mandis deputy commissioner is also planned, he said. The army has deployed relief columns across Mandi, including in Thunag, Bagsiad and Pandoh. Its efforts are bolstered by the involvement of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and local authorities. The Indian Army remains committed to supporting the citizens of Himachal Pradesh during this crisis and continues to stand by the civil administration in this time of need, the brigadier said. Since the onset of monsoon on June 20, Himachal Pradesh has received 30 per cent of excess rain, and has suffered losses to the tune of Rs 740 crore, as 31 flash floods, 22 cloudbursts, and 17 landslides claimed several lives and damaged buildings, crop fields and forests. Fifteen people died and five were injured, while a search is on to trace the 27 people who went missing after 10 cloudbursts, followed by flash floods and a landslide hit Mandi on the intervening night of June 30 and July 1. At least 1,184 houses suffered extensive damage, while 780 livestock perished in the disaster. The army columns are striving to open vital routes. A critical mule track from Bagsiad to Thunag was successfully cleared on July 6, enabling the delivery of essential supplies, the officer said. Affected families in Thunag are being given medical assistance, provisions of first aid, and ration kits. In partnership with civil administration, the army has ensured delivery of relief material to remote villages cut off by the flood. And, aid has already reached Degi (July 7), Rushad (July 8), and Chapad (July 9), the officer said. All columns are in communication via mobile networks, with limited coverage at some locations, like Thunag. Satellite communications, including ISAT phone and other key communication systems, have been provided to ensure uninterrupted operational connectivity, the army said. In response to a spell of heavy rain and urban flooding in the northeast India, the Indian Army has launched extensive relief measures under Operation Jal Rahat 2, with deployment across Nagaland, Assam, and Manipur.These efforts are being led by Headquarters Inspector General Assam Rifles (North) or HQ IGAR (N) in collaboration with local authorities. On July 10, the Dimapur deputy commissioner formally requisitioned assistance from the Indian Army to provide immediate flood relief in Singrijan Colony, one of the worst-hit areas in Nagaland, an official said. The army swiftly responded with the deployment of an Engineer Task Force (ETF) team, he said. While a verbal de-requisition was received later in the day, the army remains on standby with resources mobilised through the Flood Relief Control Centre at HQ IGAR (N), the official added. In Upper Assam, the Dhansiri River in Golaghat district has breached the danger level. The army said, although the water level is now receding, the force continues to monitor the situation closely. In Manipur, the Nambol River flowing through Imphal West and Bishnupur districts has also surpassed danger levels. While the floodwater has begun to recede, the army remains actively engaged in relief operations, another official said. As of July 10, the Indian Army has deployed 40 relief columns (24 main and 16 reserve) across the region, the person said. A total of 3,820 people have since been rescued, over 1,360 food packets distributed, medical aid provided to 2,095 individuals, and 15,421 water bottles supplied to aid affected people, the army official said.",
