  "text": "ATLANTA, July 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In response to the devastating floods that swept through Central Texas and the Hill Country, Graham Media Group and Gray Media have joined forces to launch an urgent donation drive supporting local relief and recovery efforts. The July 4 floods uprooted families, destroyed homes, and left entire communities reeling. While recovery will take time, there is a critical need for shelter, supplies, and support. The campaign raised more than $120,000 in donations in its first 24 hours, including a $25,000 donation from Gray. Graham Media Group is making an additional $15,000 donation to the campaign.\nThrough this collaborative campaign, Graham Media Group’s KSAT in San Antonio and KPRC in Houston and Gray stations across 113 markets in the US aim to generate donations that deliver vital resources—including food, housing, and financial aid—to impacted communities. 100% of the funds raised will support on-the-ground efforts in flood-affected regions\n“Graham Media Group is proud to partner with Gray in supporting the Salvation Army's critical emergency disaster response in Texas,\" said Catherine Badalamente, CEO Graham Media Group. \"As broadcasters, we have a responsibility to not only inform our communities about breaking news but to help them in times of crisis.
