  "text": "Department of Migrant Workers Sec. Hans Leo Cacdac in this file photo. He said on Thursday eight of 21 Filipino crew of the ill-fated MV Eternity C were rescued. Arnel Tacson/INQUIRER.net\nMANILA, Philippines — Eight of the 21 Filipino crew of the ill-fated MV Eternity C were rescued as of Thursday, after the bulk carrier was attacked by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea.\nThe Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) remains hopeful that the remaining 13 still unaccounted Filipino seafarers are alive and safe with rescue operations ongoing. This was amid reports that at least three of the ship’s crew were killed and several others were abducted and currently held by the Iran-aligned Islamist group.\nArticle continues after this advertisement In a Palace press briefing, DMW Sec. Hans Cacdac said five Filipino crew of MV Eternity C were rescued after they were found in the seas by responding rescue teams.\nFEATURED STORIES GLOBALNATION Brother of Duterte adviser arrested for multiple criminal offenses GLOBALNATION Alan Cayetano pushes for Rodrigo Duterte release, house arrest GLOBALNATION Man who killed cats in Singapore has jail term doubled to 27 months READ: Marcos orders aid for PH seafarers’ kin after vessel sinks in Red Sea\nThree more Filipino seafarers were added to the survivors, he said in an interview on dzBB on Thursday afternoon.\nAlthough they spent more than 24 hours in the water, the DMW chief said they were in “good condition.”\n“None of them has serious physical injury or illness. But of course, it is safe to say that they may have some physical stress with what they went through,” he added.\nArticle continues after this advertisement According to Cacdac, the rescued Filipinos were on the way to a safe destination, which he did not disclose for security reasons.\n“The Philippine government will do all we can to provide necessary assistance to them, starting with medical, physical and mental health assistance,” he noted.\nArticle continues after this advertisement Cacdac said the DMW already started on Wednesday night their personal visits to each of the families of the Filipino crew members, with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordering to provide all help to each of them.\n“We have assured them of the President’s directive to take care of them, and we will do everything so we can provide assistance to them,” he added.\nOthers still unaccounted The government already received information from the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, through the Philippine defense attache in Bahrain, that at least three Filipinos were killed but “this is still subject to confirmation.”\nMaritime security forces said Houthis attacked Eternity C with sea drones and rocket-propelled grenades fired from speed boats.\nThe Liberia-flagged and Greece-operated MV Eternity C was attacked by Houthis while it was 50 nautical miles west of Hodeidah, Yemen, on July 7 to early hours of July 8 in Manila time.\nIt has 22 crew members on board — 21, including the captain, were Filipinos; and one Russian. Three armed guards were also on board, including one Greek and one Indian, who was one of those rescued.\nThe United States Mission in Yemen accused the Houthis of kidnapping many surviving crew members from MV Eternity C and called for their immediate and unconditional safe release.\nThe DMW has suspended the license of the manning agency and principal of MV Eternity C, with Cacdac saying they would also pursue civil and criminal remedies as investigation rolls.\n“We are not happy, of course, with the way things [were] done out in terms of allowing the crew to sail to a high-risk zone,” Cacdac said.\nMultiple violations Based on its initial investigation, the manning agency and the principal committed several violations, including failure to comply with the strict reportorial processes and other critical requirements prior to sailing.\n“Worse, the ship traversed the Red Sea not once but twice,” Cacdac noted.\nUnder DMW Department Order No. 1 issued in March 2024, shipowners and manning agencies are mandated to report planned passages through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden and ensure Filipino crew members are fully informed of the risks involved. Filipino seafarers have the right to refuse to sail in these so-called warlike zones.\nThe ship originated from Egypt and unloaded its cargo in Berbera, Somalia. It was supposed to depart for Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, but got attacked upon reaching the Red Sea west of Hodeidah, Yemen.\nREAD: In 2 Houthi attacks, 17 Filipinos safe; PH checking on 21 others\nIt was the second attack of Houthis in the same week. The Houthis also have claimed responsibility for MV Magic Seas.\nAll 17 Filipino crew from MV Magic Seas were rescued before it sank. They are set to arrive in Manila on July 11.\nMeanwhile, the DMW is eyeing to impose tighter regulations in the deployment of Filipino seafarers after the attacks of Houthi rebels against two Filipino-manned vessels in the Red Sea.\nCacdac did not directly answer if a temporary stoppage of deployment of Filipino seafarers would be recommended to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\n“We are seeking the help of political and security experts, as well as the DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs) and the DND (Department of National Defense), to analyze or tell us how the situation has changed or worsened. Of course we know that the Houthis have skips, RPGs and ballistic missiles, but we want to know the intensity and the tenor of the Houthi side with respect to these particular attacks,” he said.\nYour subscription could not be saved.
