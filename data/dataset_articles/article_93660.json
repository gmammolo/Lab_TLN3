  "text": "The Minnesota Vikings’ roster has yet to reach its full potential as injuries have impacted the team early this season.\nAhead of a Week 8 matchup against the Los Angeles Chargers, there was the potential that Pro Bowl edge rusher Andrew Van Ginkel and Pro Bowl fullback C.J. Ham would return from injury.\nHowever, on a short week before the “Thursday Night Football” matchup, the Vikings have ruled out both Van Ginkel and Ham. Van Ginkel is ailing from a lingering neck injury that he suffered in the season opener, while Ham has returned to practice after starting the season on the injured reserve list.\nThat isn’t the end of injury concerns for Minnesota.\nStarting tackles Christian Darrisaw (knee) and Brian O’Neill (knee) and running back Aaron Jones (hamstring) are listed as questionable on the final injury report.\nJ.J. McCarthy, dealing with an ankle injury, is also listed as questionable but is expected to serve as the emergency quarterback as Carson Wentz gets his fifth start for the Vikings. Max Brosmer will be the immediate backup to Wentz, who is also dealing with a shoulder injury.\nVikings QB Situation Reaches Boiling Point as JJ McCarthy Nears Return\nAs the Vikings enter Thursday’s primetime matchup at 3-3 on the season, Minnesota’s quarterback crisis has hit its boiling point.\nNational pundits have continued to speculate on the severity of McCarthy’s injury and the potential of a “soft benching” by head coach Kevin O’Connell. Regardless of the validity of those takes, fans in Minnesota are eager to see McCarthy given Wentz’s performance in his place.\nWentz has kept the Vikings afloat, going 2-2 as a starter and throwing five touchdowns to four interceptions. However, Wentz’s accuracy and decision-making were suspect as he threw two interceptions, one of which went for a pick-six in a 28-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles last week.\nThe Vikings are likely a .500 team with Wentz under center, but the purpose of this season is to learn what Minnesota has in McCarthy.\nO’Connell indicated that McCarthy is close to returning and maintained that he wanted to see the 22-year-old have a full week of practice before his next start — effectively disqualifying him from starting this week even before the Eagles game.\nMcCarthy appears poised to return for a Week 9 matchup against the Detroit Lions. The game has been circled by many local beat reporters since the bye week.\nBut if he doesn’t play next week, it may officially be time to panic in Minnesota.\nVikings Can’t Afford a Loss to Chargers on TNF\nIt’s early, but the Vikings are facing an uphill battle to make the postseason.\nCurrently fourth in the NFC North, the Vikings have an 11% chance of making the playoffs, according to The Athletic’s playoff simulator.\nThe divisional stretch of the schedule is going to be a gauntlet, and the Vikings have little margin for error already.\nA loss would bury the Vikings’ playoff chances to just 7% before facing the defending champion Lions and division-leading Green Bay Packers in the first of two games each.",
