  "text": "LOS ANGELES — It’s time to pull the plug on the grand finale. After soaring to heights few have ever reached, LeBron James should have already left the stage: walked off, hugged his teammates, taken the confetti and champagne and said, “That’s a wrap.” Instead, we’re watching an aging icon, injured, distracted, and seemingly uninvested, stretch out a swan song no one asked for.\nLet’s salute LeBron the champion: the scoring king, the basketball genius, the guy who grew the game globally, showed up with his son on the same court, and earned his rings — four of ’em, with three different franchises. His 2024‑25 numbers — 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 8.2 assists while shooting 51.3 percent — still looked respectable for a 40‑year‑old. But behold the strange beast of the 2025‑26 season: LeBron opts into a $52.6 million contract at 41 years old. He begins the season injured—a sciatic nerve issue, missing practice, missing the opener. And he’s visibly unexcited. The spark is gone. The urgency melted. The clarity of purpose? Fuggetaboutit.\nWhich begs the question: Why keep going? Why stretch out what should be the headline chapter into a footnote? The man has nothing to prove anymore. LeBron has done everything. The trophies, the accolades, the legacy, the breaking records—passed Kareem, set scoring marks, done the “father‑son duo” thing. Yet here we are: LeBron winding down in L.A., on a roster built around him and one other marquee star, yet without the zeal one expects of championship pursuit. It feels like dragging for the sake of dragging.\nAnd let’s talk about those “bronsexuals” on Twitter—the deluded ride‑the‑meat fans who still tweet “King forever” and “The GOAT” every time someone mentions a faint whisper of possibility. You know the ones: every miss is a “charming vintage LeBron fadeaway,” every injury a “strategic load management masterpiece.” Give me a break. We aren’t buying the fairy tale anymore. We want the story to end, not keep limping along.\nA FANTASTIC FINISH TO OPEN THE NBA SEASON\n— NBA (@NBA)\nSGA jumper to send it to OT\nAlpi putback to force 2OT\nSGA hits the GW FTs\nRockets, Thunder deliver an instant classic out West![pic.twitter.com/4LMYQlPBm3][October 22, 2025]\nHere’s a primer on what needs to happen: The Los Angeles Lakers should say thank you, have a one‑day contract reunion with the Cavs (because hey, that’s where it started) and retire LeBron properly. No more faux “I’m still hungry” ads with high‑end cocktails and premium spirits. No more “I’ve still got it in me” headlines. The man’s been “warning of retirement” for years now. Enough is enough.\nYes, he still delivers glimpses of brilliance. Yes, his basketball IQ still sets him apart. And yes, we’ll always remember the LeBron who bullied his way into greatness, whose court vision defined generations, whose silhouette shaped the culture. But greatness doesn’t require seasons of meandering exit. Let’s face it: if the regular season now doesn’t mean much to him, then what are we all doing here? Showing up for matinees when the finale happened years ago?\nLook: if LeBron were hungrier than ever, if he were begging for the battle, bruised but unbowed, you wouldn’t find me writing this. But we are in a strange twilight: where a once‑relentless competitor looks like he’s ticking boxes. The fans, the organization, the league—they deserve better than half‑heart. The Lakers, especially: time to rebuild, time to let the torch pass.\nSo let’s raise one final glass to LeBron James the legend—but then flip it over, chalk the rim, and hand him the keys to the bench. Walk away with dignity. The advertisements, the social media campaigns, the “I have another year” narratives—they’re just padding the credits. We want the story to walk off the court, not shuffle out late by mistake.\nIn short: LeBron, you’ve had one of the greatest careers the game has ever seen. You’ve earned your peace. You’ve worn the crown. Don’t stay too long. Let the Lakers move on. Let the headlines rest. Let the next era begin. Because this time, the show is over—and the audience is ready to get up, clear their cups, and leave.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
