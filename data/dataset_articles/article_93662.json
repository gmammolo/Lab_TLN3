  "text": "T he pressure on Tua Tagovailoa has reached a critical point. With the Miami Dolphins enduring a 1-6 start to the 2025 season, the quarterback's performance has come under intense scrutiny.\nMike McDaniel reaffirmed that Tagovailoa remains the starter, saying: \"He's gonna take the snaps this week and he's gonna be our starter this week.\"\nMiami Dolphins fans are done with Tua Tagovailoa and they demand a new quarterback However, he also made it clear that expectations have changed: \"My expectation is that we don't throw 10 picks.\"\nIn response to that mounting pressure, Tagovailoa has significantly increased his workload in practice.\nHe was a full participant in Wednesday's session despite dealing with a left thumb injury, and when asked about the issue, he replied simply: \"It's good.\"\nPlaying backup to uncertainty The numbers behind Tagovailoa 's current form tell a worrying story. In his most recent outing against the Cleveland Browns , he completed just 12 of 23 passes for 100 yards, threw three interceptions, and posted a passer rating of 24.1 - the lowest of his professional career.\nSo far this season, he has thrown 10 interceptions compared to 11 touchdowns, leaving the Dolphins in a precarious offensive position.\nAcknowledging his struggles, Tagovailoa didn't shy away from taking responsibility: \"That's true, no? You don't want anyone that's going in there to hinder the team from being able to win the game.\n\"The way I've turned the ball over this year, you can't expect to help the guys win the game.\" He added: \"I'm frustrated about those, and I got to do something about that. That's for sure.\"\nThose words reflect a quarterback fully aware of the pressure he's under - but awareness alone won't be enough to secure his job.\nMike McDaniel's ultimatum and internal pressure Behind the scenes, Mike McDaniel has become more pointed in his public and private messaging. Earlier in the season, he strongly backed Tagovailoa , but with turnovers piling up, his tone has sharpened.\n\"It's not the forum to displace that,\" he said when addressing the quarterback's recent comments about team accountability.\nTeam sources have suggested that multiple meetings between McDaniel and Tagovailoa have emphasized a single message: reduce mistakes and rediscover the rhythm that once powered the Dolphins offense. It's an ultimatum wrapped in trust - but the margin for error is closing rapidly.\nTo keep his starting role, Tagovailoa must clean up turnovers, sharpen decision-making, and execute more efficiently in McDaniel 's high-tempo offense.\nHe must also reestablish confidence among his teammates, including star playmakers Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle . With a talented supporting cast, the Dolphins are built to contend, but only if their quarterback can deliver under pressure.\nThe thumb injury that Tagovailoa has been managing adds context but not excuses. This team is running out of time to save its season, and patience from coaches and ownership may be wearing thin.",
