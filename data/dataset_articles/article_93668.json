  "text": "“A gentle giant with a big heart.”\nThis is how Talei Veitayaki, the daughter of former Flying Fijian prop Joeli Veitayaki, described him when relaying news of his passing yesterday.\nHe was 58-years-old.\nIn a post on social media platform Meta (Facebook), she said his passing was unexpected.\n“Joeli’s (Veitayaki) passing has come as a great shock to our family and we are taking time to come together,” she wrote.\n“A gentle giant with a big heart. He was loved by many and had an huge impact on his community.”\nMeanwhile, Veitayaki was an integral part of the Flying Fijians in his prime, a prop whose build would help stabilise and power scrum formations and had been part of a Flying Fijians team in the mid 90s to early 2000s that carved a new image into the brand as it progressed into the new millennium.\nNews of his passing shook many, and tributes have since begun to pour in for him.\nMeanwhile, the Yaroi, Matuku, Lau great wore the white national jumper from 1994 to 2003, making 49 appearances and scoring 15 points.\nIn his local rugby career, he played for Rewa Rugby, the Marist Rugby Club and Police.\nVenturing to New Zealand, he played in the Super Rugby competition for the Chiefs in 1996 with 11 appearances and two appearances with the Blues in 1999.\nHis daughter, Talei, added funeral arrangements would be announced in due course.",
