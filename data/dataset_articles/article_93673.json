  "text": "By WTVR CBS 6 Web Staff ,\n23 hours ago RICHMOND, Va. — The John Marshall Justices forfeited last week's varsity football game against Northampton after several ejections and mandated suspensions left them with too few eligible players to play safely.\nThe school announced Tuesday they are also forfeiting this week's game against J.R. Tucker, and next week's scheduled game against Prince Edward.\nThe team will still attempt to finish out their regular season on November 7 against Arcadia, provided they have enough players under VHSL regulations to field a team.\nThis is a developing story.
