  "text": "Oscar Piastri's Formula 1 championship lead narrows after finishing fifth in the United States Grand Prix. Teammate Lando Norris and Red Bull's Max Verstappen close in, reducing Piastri's advantage. Piastri and McLaren face a challenging final stretch with five races left, starting in Mexico City. Oscar Piastri's lead in the Formula 1 championship is under threat as rivals Lando Norris and Max Verstappen make significant gains at the United States Grand Prix. Piastri finished in a disappointing fifth place, while Verstappen claimed victory, tightening the championship race. With just five races remaining, the pressure mounts on Piastri. Despite still holding a 14-point lead over Norris and 40 points over Verstappen, Piastri acknowledges the rising tension and competition. As contenders close in, the championship battle promises to be an intense showdown. (With inputs from agencies.)",
