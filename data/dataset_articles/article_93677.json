  "text": "Tua Tagovailoa , quarterback of the Miami Dolphins , is facing one of the most difficult stretches of his career.\nAs the team sits at 1-6, scrutiny over his performance and the offense's lack of rhythm has intensified. Hall of Fame quarterback Kurt Warner believes the root of the problem comes down to one factor: confidence.\nMiami Dolphins fans are done with Tua Tagovailoa and they demand a new quarterback Appearing on the Rich Eisen Show , Warner said the Dolphins appeared to be second-guessing themselves, starting with their quarterback.\n\"They've lost confidence,\" Warner said. \"And it's not that they don't have talent. It's that they're hesitant.\"\nThe reality is stark: Tagovailoa has one of the most talented supporting casts in the league, but the results have not reflected that potential.\nTua Tagovailoa's confidence is wavering The Dolphins entered the season with big expectations. Tagovailoa signed a major contract extension and returned with elite playmakers around him.\nBut recent performances have exposed hesitation in his reads and inconsistencies in his execution. Warner identified the issue clearly: \"When your quarterback starts hesitating, defenders know it. They attack the pace.\"\nOffseason injuries and concussion history have added more pressure. Tagovailoa was once praised for his quick release and decision-making, but defenses are now keying in on him earlier in plays, forcing him to extend and improvise - something he's struggled with in recent weeks.\nHis accuracy remains elite when he releases the ball quickly, but broken plays have highlighted weaknesses in his pocket awareness and improvisation.\nAs one former coach told Sports Illustrated , his \"hero mode\" can no longer cover deeper structural problems in the offense.\nThe problems aren't only about Tagovailoa . Head coach Mike McDaniel 's timing-based system depends heavily on his quarterback being in rhythm.\nWhen hesitation creeps in, the entire offense stalls. Warner said: \"The shot-clock is part of your training - the decision-making must be automatic.\"\nThe Dolphins still have stars like Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle , and a strong backfield that can support an explosive attack. But short drives and missed red zone chances have become too common.\n\"When you're fighting from behind, everything gets harder,\" Warner added.\nEven with elite talent, the offense can't function if its leader lacks conviction. Opposing defenses have taken advantage, pressing receivers and forcing Tagovailoa to make tougher reads late in the play clock.\nRebuilding confidence is the key For Tagovailoa , the path forward is clear but difficult. He needs to trust his reads again, play fast, and regain the confidence that once defined his style.\nWarner believes it's about simplifying and rebuilding step by step: \"When you return to playing instinctively, the stats will follow.\"\nFor the Miami Dolphins as a whole, the solution isn't just on the quarterback. The coaching staff needs to adjust protection schemes, reintroduce tempo, and emphasize short-decision plays to help Tagovailoa find his rhythm again.\nAt 1-6, the pressure is mounting. Whether Tua Tagovailoa can regain form - and whether Mike McDaniel can stabilize the system - may define the remainder of the Dolphins season.",
