  "text": "Boise State head coach Spencer Danielson announced today that wide receiver Ben Ford will miss the remainder of the season after suffering a lower leg injury last week against UNLV.\nIt's a tough blow for the Broncos, as Ford had been one of the team's most dynamic playmakers through the first half of the year. The senior wideout led Boise State with five receiving touchdowns and ranked second on the team with 325 receiving yards, emerging as a reliable target for quarterback Maddux Madsen in both the slot and red zone.\nDanielson noted that there's a possibility Ford could apply for a medical redshirt and return next season:\n\"Yeah, I feel really confident about some of those things. (Gaining more eligibility)\" Said Danielson \"We still have to work thru some of those things, it's new.\"\nUnfortunately, this isn't Ford's first setback. He also missed the entire 2023 season due to injury, making this another difficult chapter in what's been a promising but injury-plagued career.\nSee the full interview below.",
