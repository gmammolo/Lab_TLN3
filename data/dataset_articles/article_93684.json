  "text": "Ben Ford out for season\n- That really sucks. He was having a great year!\nWill he able to play next year? - Discussion\nThat SUCKS for him (and BSU). He was finally getting a chance to shine. Not to mention, he was becoming a go-to steady receiver for us.\ncatpooptv said...(original post) That really sucks. He was having a great year!Will he able to play next year?Yeah, that does suck! I have no idea how it works, but I would think he’s played too much for a red shirt medical exemption? But like I said, I have no idea…\n- Since he missed the entire 2023 season with injury, there's a good chance the NCAA will grant him a sixth year, assuming he wants it.\n- Gawd I feel for Ben Ford. He's fought injury pretty much his entire career. Finally healthy he shows what a stud weapon he is, only to get gut shot again. Can't imagine the mental strain this puts on him. The kid deserves better.\nHopefully he gets another year but at the very least we seem to have some emerging receivers with Bates and Brown to supplement Caples and Marshall\nMarshall has another year also if he wants it correct?\nBahbahGanoosh said...(original post) Marshall has another year also if he wants it correct?\nHe does have another season.I really enjoyed watching him play. I unfortunately doubt he will be able to play next year. He already tried getting an extra year in 2023. If it does get approved, then that would be cool, but I just don't see it happening.\n- Too bad for him. He was just starting to shine.\nDarn! Loved this guy",
