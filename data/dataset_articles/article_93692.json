  "text": "Virat Kohli's lean patch continues with back-to-back ducks against Australia\nThe spotlight was once again on Virat Kohli, but for all the wrong reasons. The Indian batting great’s lean patch stretched further on Thursday as he fell for a second straight duck in the ODI series against Australia in Adelaide — a rare slump for one of modern cricket’s most consistent performers.\nWalking in during the seventh over after captain Shubman Gill’s dismissal, Kohli looked determined to rebuild India’s innings. However, his stay was short-lived.\nAfter carefully negotiating the first three deliveries from Xavier Bartlett, Kohli was undone by a sharp inswinger that crashed into his stumps. Without a second thought, he walked back to the pavilion — a sight that left fans stunned and social media abuzz.\nThis marked Kohli’s second consecutive duck, raising questions about his rhythm and shot selection in recent outings.\nKnown for his unmatched intensity and hunger for runs, the 35-year-old has endured a few starts and stops over the past year, and his current form will be a talking point as India continues its preparations for upcoming tournaments.\nAt the toss earlier, Australia captain Mitchell Marsh elected to bowl first against India in the second ODI. India are unchanged, while Australia made two changes, bringing in Alex Carey for Josh Philippe and Xavier Bartlett in place of Nathan Ellis.\nUnlock Exclusive Insights with The Tribune Premium\nTake your experience further with Premium access.\nThought-provoking Opinions, Expert Analysis, In-depth Insights and other Member Only Benefits\nAlready a Member?
