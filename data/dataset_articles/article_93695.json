Portland generated the only shot attempt, a David Ayala left-footed boot that sailed over the crossbar.\nThe Timbers came up empty on consecutive corners in the 14th minute as they built a little momentum.\nAfter threatening for several minutes, Portland finally broke through in the 24th minute. Off a set-piece, Felipe Mora’s first attempt was turned away by Rafael Cabral, but the rebound was too juicy.\nMora blasted the ball past a helpless defense for a 1-0 lead.\nFelipe Mora strikes! 💥\n[@TimbersFC]open the scoring for[@TimbersFC]against RSL in the Wild Card // Audi MLS Cup Playoffs[pic.twitter.com/AI6PPrxbCi]— Major League Soccer (@MLS)\n[October 23, 2025]\nMinutes later, Victor Olatunji sailed a shot wide for RSL.\nMora gave his club a 2-0 lead in the 35th minute with another rebound goal. After his initial header was stopped, the run of play brought Mora and the ball back together for an easy brace.\nFirst-half brace for Felipe Mora! 😤\n[@TimbersFC]lead RSL 2-0 // Audi MLS Cup Playoffs[pic.twitter.com/AflreNKjHu]— Major League Soccer (@MLS)\n[October 23, 2025]\nReal Salt Lake didn’t blink.\nHomegrown defender Justen Glad cut the deficit in half when he scored an unassisted 39th-minute goal.\nDiogo Gonçalves drops a dime! 👀\nJusten Glad heads it in! 💥[@realsaltlake]cut the deficit in half // Audi MLS Cup Playoffs[pic.twitter.com/aPfR0Ko6rL]— Major League Soccer (@MLS)\n[October 23, 2025]\nThe score remained 2-1 in favor of Portland at halftime.\nSecond Half\nEmeka Eneli replaced Noel Caliskan to open the second 45 for RSL.\n45' | making a switch after the break\n[#PORvRSL]|[@SJ_Utah][pic.twitter.com/ilX6R8XdUU]— Real Salt Lake (@realsaltlake)\n[October 23, 2025]\nThe visitors pressed the attack, trailing by one in the do-or-die match. RSL had a 54th-minute goal wiped away when three players were offside on a rebound.\nEneli and DeAndre Yedlin took consecutive shots moments later and were stoned by Portland’s James Pantemis.\nPortland appeared willing to sit back and let the game come to them with the one-goal advantage.\nTwo RSL equalizers in the second half and both have been waved off\n[#RSL]— RSL Show on KSL 🎙️⚡️ (@rslshow)\n[October 23, 2025]\nReal Salt Lake continued pressuring the Timbers, with no better chance coming than a William Agada bicycle attempt that caromed off the crossbar and bounded away.\nPortland’s Kamal Miller took advantage of a failed Real Salt Lake clearance attempt. Miller received a perfect pass from Ariel Lassiter for a header and a 3-1 lead.\nThe Timbers withstood seven minutes of stoppage time to seal the two-goal victory.\nHow To Watch Real Salt Lake\nAll Major League Soccer games are broadcast on Apple TV with MLS Season Pass.\nAll Real Salt Lake English-language radio coverage for the 2024 season and beyond will be carried on various KSL radio signals.
