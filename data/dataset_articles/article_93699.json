  "text": "Bruins Fall to Ducks in Three Sets\nOctober 22, 2025 | Women's Volleyball\nLOS ANGELES – The No. 25-ranked UCLA women's volleyball fell to Oregon in straight sets on Wednesday night inside Pauley Pavilion presented by Wescom Financial.\nSet scores were 19-25, 19-15, 23-25.\nUCLA (11-8, 5-4 Big Ten) shook off a sluggish start to finish with a .212 hitting percentage, showing flashes of offensive rhythm as the match progressed. Still, the Bruins were unable keep pace with Oregon's relentless attack, as the Ducks (13-6, 4-5 Big Ten) fired at a .327 clip to control the tempo and secure the sweep.\nOregon saw three players reach double-digit kills including Alanah Clemente (13 kills), Valentina Vaulet (13 kills), and Sophia Meyers (10 kills).\nOregon set the tone in the opening set by racing to a 5-2 lead, but UCLA quickly responded with a 4-0 run sparked by a Singletary kill and an Ivkovic slam to take the lead. The Bruins extended their momentum with another 3-0 burst, highlighted by a Singletary ace, to go up 10-8 and later held a 15-13 edge at the media timeout. However, Oregon surged back with a 6-1 run to reclaim the lead at 19-16. Despite UCLA narrowing the gap to 20-19, the Ducks won five consecutive points to close out the first set. Offensive struggles plagued the Bruins, who hit just .091 compared to Oregon's efficient .324.\nThe visitors carried the momentum into the second frame, starting with a 3-0 burst before seeing that lead grow to 13-8, prompting a UCLA timeout. Despite Leverette and Ivkovic contributing three kills apiece, the Bruins were unable to contain the Ducks' relentless attack, which surged to a .517 hitting percentage. Oregon's efficiency proved too much, as they closed out the set 25-19.\nUCLA jumped out to a 5-2 lead in the third set and held a 9-6 advantage behind strong net play from Leverette, Briscoe, and Singletary. Oregon clawed back to even the score at 15-15, prompting a UCLA timeout, and took the lead shortly after. Leverette responded with a pair of clutch kills, including one off a long rally, to help UCLA edge ahead 22-21. However, Oregon closed out the match by winning four of the last five points, sealing the set and completing the sweep.\nUCLA will return to Pauley Pavilion presented by Wescom Financial on Saturday, Oct. 25 at 7:30 p.m. (PT) to host Maryland.
