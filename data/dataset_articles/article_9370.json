  "text": "ST. LOUIS – No injuries were reported overnight Thursday after a large fire gutted a vacant house in south St. Louis. According to the St. Louis Fire Department, the fire broke out around 3 a.m. on the 4200 block of Ellenwood in south St. Louis’ Bevo neighborhood. The initial call to first responders indicated that the fire may have started after a large trash pile caught ablaze and spread to the home. When fire crews arrived on the scene, they found a large fire in the basement and first floor of the vacant house. Squatters have been living in the house, according to neighbors, but it’s unclear if that caused the fire. There was reportedly a fire at the same house within the last 6 to 8 months. No injuries were reported from the fire, according to the fire department. Fire crews were able to put the fire out and prevent it from spreading to occupied homes nearby.
