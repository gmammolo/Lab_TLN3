  "text": "BOSTON — If Wednesday night was supposed to prove the Boston Celtics could survive without Jayson Tatum, then mission failed. Miserably.\nThe Celtics blew a winnable home opener, falling 117-116 to a Philadelphia 76ers team that trotted out a hobbling Joel Embiid and an untested rookie as its offensive engine. Philadelphia looked like a team trying to find itself. Boston looked like one that already quit.\nThis isn’t one of those “it’s early, don’t panic” losses. It’s a warning shot.\nThe Celtics spent the summer tightening their wallets, trimming veterans, and spinning their Achilles-struck superstar’s absence into an excuse for mediocrity. Tatum’s injury, yes, changes the ceiling. But a real contender adjusts. Boston simply deflated.\nStart with the roster. The Celtics chose to save money instead of maintaining depth. Jrue Holiday? Gone. Kristaps Porziņģis? Gone. The front office called it “strategic cap management.” Everyone else calls it what it is: cutting costs and lowering expectations.\nAnd for what? To run a team that collapses in crunch time against a Philadelphia squad that needed Tyrese Maxey and rookie V.J. Edgecombe to score 74 of its 117 points. Maxey roasted Boston for 40, Edgecombe added 34, and both looked like they were in a layup line while the Celtics’ defense stood frozen in disbelief.\nEmbiid, meanwhile, limped to four points in 20 minutes. Let that sink in. Boston lost to a team whose MVP center contributed about as much offensively as the mascot.\nBoston shot 45 percent from the field, hit 11-of-43 from three, and went flat when it mattered most. They led by 11 in the third quarter. Then, with four minutes left, the wheels came off. The Sixers closed on a 15-2 run, capped by a Kelly Oubre three that sucked the air out of TD Garden.\nPayton Pritchard had two clean looks to win it in the final seconds. Both missed. The arena fell silent except for the thud of reality.\nBrown and White each finished with 25 points, doing their part to keep Boston afloat. But they were soloists in a band with broken instruments. Without cohesion, every possession turned into improvisation — no structure, no backbone, no urgency.\nHere’s the problem with Boston’s approach: it treats Jayson Tatum like a savior rather than a centerpiece. He’s an All-NBA talent, one of the league’s most complete forwards. But he’s not LeBron in his prime. You can’t punt on an entire season just because your star’s hurt.\nChampionship teams are built on accountability, not dependency. Miami lost Jimmy Butler for stretches and stayed afloat. Milwaukee survived without Giannis. The Celtics? They appear content to drift until Tatum returns. That’s not strategy. That’s surrender.\nMeanwhile, the organization keeps charging championship prices for a development-league product. Tickets, concessions, parking — all premium. The product on the floor? Discount-rack effort. Fans deserve better than corporate caution disguised as prudence.\nBoston likes to remind the league it’s a “banner-chasing” franchise. The banners are supposed to represent ambition. Lately, they feel like museum pieces, reminders of a time when the team actually cared about competing every night.\nA FANTASTIC FINISH TO OPEN THE NBA SEASON\n— NBA (@NBA)\nSGA jumper to send it to OT\nAlpi putback to force 2OT\nSGA hits the GW FTs\nRockets, Thunder deliver an instant classic out West![pic.twitter.com/4LMYQlPBm3][October 22, 2025]\nJoe Mazzulla’s fingerprints were all over the collapse. The rotations were scattered, the defensive communication nonexistent, and the late-game sets uninspired. Mazzulla has often preached trust and ball movement. Neither was present when it mattered. His team looked tentative, uncomfortable, and strangely unprepared for the moment.\nMaybe it’s rust. Maybe it’s roster turnover. But when a team that still features Jaylen Brown, Derrick White, and Al Horford can’t close out a game against a gutted Sixers squad, coaching deserves scrutiny.\nBoston’s ownership wanted to save money this summer. It shows. The bench is thin. The rotation is fragile. The accountability is absent.\nThe Celtics could’ve used the offseason to reload — to find a short-term scoring spark, a defensive wing, a rim-protector to cover the loss of Porziņģis. Instead, they chose fiscal restraint. They’ve built a $5 billion franchise that plays like it’s coupon-clipping.\nThis loss isn’t catastrophic on paper. It’s one game. But tone matters, and the Celtics opened their season by signaling they’re not here to fight. They’re here to wait. Wait for Tatum. Wait for health. Wait for relevance.\nThat’s not Boston basketball. That’s brand management.\nThe Celtics love to call themselves “Title Town.” But title towns don’t punt on seasons before Halloween. They don’t lose at home to a wounded rival and shrug. They don’t ask fans to pay full freight for half a product.\nThe Tatum injury gives Boston an excuse. But excuses don’t hang banners.\nIf this front office doesn’t rediscover its competitive pulse — and fast — the Celtics’ biggest win this season will be at the ticket counter, not on the scoreboard. And in a city where standards matter, that’s the real embarrassment.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams. Emailed daily. Always free!",
