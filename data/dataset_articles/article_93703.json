  "text": "By Alison Ahmoye ,\n3 hours ago A long-time Mariners fan, Rachel Ramseur, is recovering after being injured during a game against the Detroit Tigers earlier this month at T-Mobile Park.\nRamseur, a season ticket holder and devoted fan for over 20 years, says she was tackled by another fan while attempting to catch a foul ball, resulting in a broken ankle.\n“I just feel kind of disregarded,” said Ramseur, expressing her disappointment with the Mariners’ lack of response to the incident.\nThe incident occurred when Ramseur saw a foul ball drop near her and attempted to retrieve it.\nBefore she could reach the ball, she says a man tackled her, causing her to fall and break her ankle on both sides.\nRamseur’s wife, Sasha Summer Cousineau, was alerted to the injury via an SOS message from Ramseur’s Apple Watch.\nThe Mariners’ liability release states that ticket holders assume risk of injury, including those caused by other spectators’ misconduct.\nKIRO 7 reached out to the Mariners but have yet to hear back.\nRamseur has filed an assault report with the Seattle Police, who have confirmed that the investigation is ongoing.\nDespite her injuries and mounting medical bills, Ramseur is most hurt by the lack of response from the Mariners, a team she has supported for decades.",
