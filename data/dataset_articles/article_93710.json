  "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers’ 2025-26 season opener was rough on the scoreboard, on the floor and in the locker room.\nLeBron James was unavailable, the team fell 119-109 to the Golden State Warriors, and former No. 1 pick Deandre Ayton, under heavy preseason scrutiny, did little to silence his critics.\nShaquille O’Neal Calls Out De’Andre Ayton\nLakers legend Shaquille O’Neal wasted no time addressing the issue on ESPN’s Inside the NBA debut show Wednesday night. Never one to bite his tongue, O’Neal delivered a bold on-air challenge — and it sounded less like advice, more like a demand.\n“Listen, Deandre, DominAyton — that performance yesterday,” O’Neal said, flashing a thumbs-down gesture. “I need you to step it up, my boy. You got to do three things. You got to rebound, you got to block shots, and you got to dominate.”\nO’Neal didn’t stop there, pushing Ayton to make the most of the opportunities that come with playing alongside stars Luka Dončić and Austin Reaves.\n“The pressure’s not on you,” Shaq continued. “You got two great players that get doubled a lot. When they make that little bounce pass, catch it, and throw it down. You had a small guy guarding you in the post, and you turn around and shoot a fadeaway — that’s not going to get it done. We need you, brother. We need you to step it up.”\nAyton’s debut in purple and gold didn’t inspire much confidence. The 7-footer finished with just 10 points on 5-of-7 shooting, grabbing six rebounds with zero assists. He committed four turnovers and often looked hesitant against a smaller Warriors front line.\nInstead of establishing his presence inside, Ayton drifted toward awkward fadeaways and midrange jumpers, a habit that drew audible groans from the Crypto.com Arena crowd.\nFor the Lakers, the frustration runs deeper than one game. After years of cycling through big men and missing out on proven centers like Brook Lopez and Clint Capela, Los Angeles bet big on Ayton. They viewed him as a potential redemption story, a chance for the former No. 1 pick to reset his career and fill a critical need.\nBut the early signs are troubling. Ayton’s effort and consistency have long been questioned, from his underwhelming stint in Portland to his drop-off after leaving Phoenix.\nWith James sidelined and the offense flowing through Dončić and Reaves, this was Ayton’s best opportunity to make a statement. Instead, he looked lost, and now O’Neal is publicly demanding more.\nO’Neal’s message — stop fading away and start dominating — was on point. With the Lakers’ hopes tied to finding stability in the paint, Ayton’s response in the coming weeks might determine how long that patience lasts.",
