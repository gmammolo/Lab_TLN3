  "text": "Walking off the field in Saturday's contest against the Louisville Cardinals was a bitter taste in defeat. The Miami Hurricanes must regroup. It was disappointing that the Canes could not overcome crucial mistakes to solidify a comeback win, despite the whole team not playing the type of game most Hurricane fans have grown accustomed to viewing.\nIn hindsight, it would have been a \"tall order\", for the Hurricanes to end the 2025 unblemished. Still, the Miami Hurricanes have unfinished business to accomplish. First, the Canes must strive to put Saturday's ACC Conference defeat behind them. Secondly, the program must develop and sustain the motivation and hunger that propelled the program on the cusp of newly acquired greatness, and lastly, the Hurricanes must approach every remaining ACC Conference opponent with a \"hunter's mentality.",
