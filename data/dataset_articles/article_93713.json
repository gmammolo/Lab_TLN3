This was the second consecutive duck for Kohli after he failed to score in the first ODI clash in Perth as well. It was also the first time since his debut back in 2008 that Kohli registered two consecutive ducks in ODI cricket. He came out to bat in the 7th over of India's innings and although he played the first three deliveries from Xavier Bartlett with caution, the fourth one nipped back and crashed into his pads. The umpire raised his finger without any doubt and even Kohli decided to not go for the review as his innings came to an end.\nTopics mentioned in this article\nIndia Cricket Team\nAustralia Cricket Team\nVirat Kohli\nXavier BartlettAustralia vs India 2025\nCricket",
