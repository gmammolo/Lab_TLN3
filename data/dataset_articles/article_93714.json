  "text": "Virat Kohli’s nightmare farewell to Australia has continued with the first back-to-back ducks of his stellar ODI career.\nThe Indian great’s expected last appearances on Australian soil have brought bumper crowds to the white-ball series.\nBut thousands of fans inside Adelaide Oval on Thursday witnessed a sad end to Kohli’s relationship with the famous ground.\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\nKohli was trapped lbw by Xavier Bartlett for a duck on just his fourth ball.\nIt followed an eight-ball duck in the series opener in Perth last weekend, marking the first time he has not scored in two straight innings.\nODI cricket is Kohli’s only remaining avenue to representing India after retiring from Test cricket and T20 internationals, with the 2027 World Cup on the horizon if his form holds up.\nHe considered reviewing the umpire’s decision on Thursday but ran out of time while in discussions with Rohit Sharma.\nKohli bowed his head and slumped his shoulders as he walked off the ground, barely raising his head as he waved his gloves to the crowd.\n“Is that just a bit of a sign that this is the last time we will see him in Australia?” Mike Hussey said in commentary.\nBartlett reckoned he was “lucky” to dismiss Kohli.\n“Probably one of the best white-ball players of all time,” he said during a drinks break.\n“Lucky to get him, I tried to bowl an outswinger and it nipped back. Probably a bit of pure luck but nice to see the back of him early.”\nKohli first played in Australia in 2011 and has raised the bat for 12 centuries across all formats.\nBartlett returned to the side in place of the rested Nathan Ellis and instantly outshone star teammates Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood.\nBefore nabbing Kohli, the 26-year-old had Indian captain Shubman Gill caught at mid-off by Aussie skipper Mitch Marsh.\nStream free on",
