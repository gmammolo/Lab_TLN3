  "text": "Patrick Kane Injury Update: Is Patrick Kane Playing Tonight?\nPatrick Kane is hurt again and yeah, that really stings if you’re a Detroit Red Wings fan. The 36-year-old winger, who’s been off to such a promising start this season with five points in five games, is now sidelined with what the team’s calling an “upper-body injury.” Those words always sound vague and mysterious, don’t they? But that’s the NHL way they like to keep medical details secret, as if the opposition might weaponize information about a sore shoulder. According to coach Todd McLellan, Kane was injured after crashing into the boards late in Detroit’s 2–1 overtime win against the Tampa Bay Lightning. He didn’t finish the game. The next morning, he wasn’t on the ice for practice.\nOn Twitter, @WingedWheelPod reported injury updates: Patrick Kane will be out on Sunday vs. Edmonton due to an upper-body injury, while Lucas Raymond who missed the last two games remains day-to-day.\nFor anyone wondering: yes, he’s missing tonight’s matchup too. The Red Wings are on a short road trip, with games against Buffalo and the Islanders, but Kane didn’t travel. Instead, he’s staying back in Detroit to rest and be re-evaluated before Saturday’s home game against the St. Louis Blues. That’s when the team will decide if he’s ready to return or if that sore arm, shoulder, or rib needs more time. He did skate lightly this week, though, which fans took as a small comfort amid the uncertainty. I mean, seeing Kane even out there gliding around is kind of reassuring the guy’s not built to sit still for long.\nOn Twitter, @WingedWheelPod shared an injury update stating that Patrick Kane will not travel with the team and will be out for Wednesday’s game vs. Buffalo and Thursday vs. the Islanders. He’s expected to be re-evaluated ahead of Saturday’s matchup against St. Louis.\nNow, Detroit will rely on younger guys like Lucas Raymond and Michael Brandsegg-Nygård to step up though replacing Kane’s poise isn’t exactly easy. If you’re watching the Wings tonight hoping for some Kane magic, you’ll have to wait a bit. He’s not suiting up. But when he does come back? Something says he’ll make up for lost time in spectacular fashion, because if history’s taught us anything, Patrick Kane rarely stays quiet for long.\nDisclaimer: This article provides the latest publicly available information on Patrick Kane’s injury status. Updates are subject to change as the Detroit Red Wings release official evaluations.",
