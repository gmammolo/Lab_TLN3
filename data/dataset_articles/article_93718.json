  "text": "News\nIs The End Near? Virat Kohli Records First-Ever Consecutive ODI Ducks\nFollow Us\nThis is Kohli’s second instance of consecutive ducks in international cricket\nVirat Kohli endured another frustrating outing in the second ODI against Australia in Adelaide on October 23 (Thursday), registering a duck once again. This marks the first time in his ODI career that Kohli has suffered back-to-back ducks in the 50-over format.\nReturning to international cricket after a hiatus since March, the right-hander has looked off-colour throughout the series. In Perth, he faced eight deliveries without scoring, attempting an ambitious drive off Mitchell Starc that edged to backward point.\nFans hoped Kohli would bounce back in Adelaide, a venue where he has scored more runs and centuries than any other overseas batter, but even one of his favourite grounds couldn’t reverse his fortunes.\nAfter losing another toss and being asked to bat first, India’s innings got off to a slow start. Rohit Sharma struggled against Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc, and Xavier Bartlett, scoring just 8 off 28 balls in the first six overs. This put immense pressure on captain Shubman Gill, who didn't get much strike before attempting a risky shot and getting caught at mid-off off Bartlett’s bowling.\nKohli walked out in the seventh over with high expectations but lasted only four balls, once again failing to score. While his Perth dismissal came from an edge to an outside-off delivery, he was undone this time by a nip-backer from Bartlett, a mode of dismissal that has troubled him in the past.\nThis is Kohli’s second instance of consecutive ducks in international cricket. The first came in 2021 when he got out for zero in a Test against England in Ahmedabad, followed by another duck against the same opponent in a T20I at the same venue.\nThis latest duck also marks Kohli’s 40th scoreless innings in international cricket. Among top-six batters, only Sanath Jayasuriya (50), Mahela Jayawardene (44), Chris Gayle (43), and Younis Khan (42) have more ducks.\nIndia ended the first 10 overs at 29/2, recording their third-lowest powerplay score in ODIs since 2023 — the previous low points also came against Australia: 27/3 in Chennai 2023 and 27/3 in Perth earlier in this series.\nPressure is mounting on Kohli, who is now active only in ODIs after retiring from T20Is and Tests. At 36, he has his sights set on the 2027 ODI World Cup, but continuing struggles like these may jeopardize his chances of featuring prominently.",
