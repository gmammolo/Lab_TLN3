  "text": "Cricket News\nIND vs AUS: Virat Kohli bags consecutive ODI ducks for first time in career, waves goodbye to fans – WATCH\nVirat Kohli's much-awaited return to the Adelaide Oval ended in disappointment. He was dismissed LBW for a duck, registering consecutive ducks for the first time in his ODI career.\nNew Delhi: Virat Kohli’s struggles on his international return continued as he was dismissed for a second consecutive duck in the three-match series against Australia at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday, October 23.\nBatting first, Kohli walked out to bat after the dismissal of skipper Shubman Gill. He was removed by Bartlett for a four-ball duck after being trapped leg-before wicket in the seventh over. Kohli decided not to take a referral and marched towards the dressing room at his most favoured overseas venue.\nVIRAT KOHLI GONE FOR HIS SECOND DUCK OF THE SERIES![#AUSvIND]|[#PlayoftheDay]|[@BKTtires][pic.twitter.com/jqIdvMeX9T]— cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau)[October 23, 2025]\nThe Men in Blue got off to a sluggish start after being sent to bat first by the Australian captain, Mitchell Marsh. Rohit and Gill batted carefully against the likes of Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc. Team India only managed to score just 17 runs in the first six overs as the openers continued to struggle against the Australian pace attack.\nIn the seventh over, Bartell dismissed Shubman Gill with a full delivery as the Indian skipper shuffled down the pitch and looked to play a shot down the ground. But, he got a bit too close to the ball and ended up chipping a catch to Marsh at mid-off.\nVirat Kohli registers back-to-back ducks for first time in ODIs\nFor the first time in 304 ODI matches, Virat Kohli registered back-to-back ducks in two consecutive games. The senior batter was previously dismissed for successive ducks in a Test and a T20I in Ahmedabad in 2021.\nThis is only the second time that Kohli has been dismissed for a duck in Australia in ODIs. Earlier, in the first match at Perth Stadium, Starc removed Kohli for an eight-ball duck. It is also his fourth duck against Australia.\n(more to follow)\nClick for more latest Cricket news.
