  "text": "Recovery efforts began in Ruidoso on Wednesday following Tuesday's deadly flash flooding, which decimated the area.At a mobile home park in Gavilan Canyon, many residents returned to homes that had been destroyed - floors caked in a layer of thick mud, doorsteps piled high with debris, and some homes swept clean off their foundations.This was my cousin's house. And we don't know where it is, said resident Darlene Apachito.Many were frightened by the impending floodwaters when warnings were issued on Tuesday, so they moved out of the way.We left like 30 minutes early because I said, 'We better leave. Look what happened in Texas. We don't know this time,' I said. So we left, said Apachito.For others, it was a helpless feeling, knowing they could not do anything to stop the raging waters.I was actually across from the links the golf course and I ended up getting stranded there because the water just came so fast it was all over the road. We didn't know what to do and there was no way we could help, said another resident, Alexx Chavez.Volunteers were also out in full force Wednesday, helping residents pick up the pieces.I'm really happy that the community came out here and started helping people who live in poverty and trailer parks because it's hard, it's hard working from day to day and losing everything all at once, said Gisselle Villareal, a volunteer in Ruidoso.One volunteer described the community's response: We had essentially a search party, going on throughout the whole town, just to see who or what could be possibly in danger.Another volunteer expressed the importance of community support, saying, I'm just trying to take the frowns off of peoples faces by giving them a cold water, a bear hug, and giving back to our community, we always do, and we always will.Rain was not an issue for Ruidoso on Wednesday; however, with chances for storms remaining in the forecast for much of the week, and with much of monsoon season still ahead, the flood threat looms.Many say that because of this impending threat, they do not want to stay.I just feel like the whole trailer park should get rid of-- I don't-- there's no more for us to be living here. Like, we're in danger, said Moraima Aguirre, a Ruidoso resident.We should have moved the first time, but we didn't, but now this one is scary, said Apachito.Sign up to receive the top interesting stories from in and around our community once daily in your inbox.",
