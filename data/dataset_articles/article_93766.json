  "text": "By Paolo Mariano ,\n1 hours ago\nBrett Davis-Imagn Images The post Trae Young sends strong message to Hawks after blowout loss to Raptors appeared first on ClutchPoints .\nTrae Young and the Atlanta Hawks started their season in the worst way possible after they got blown out by the Toronto Raptors, 138-118, in front of their home fans at State Farm Arena on Wednesday.\nWhile the Hawks played relatively well in the first half, they became listless after the break, giving up 45 points in the third quarter. The Raptors never looked back from there and cruised to the easy win.\nAtlanta only shot 42.2% from the field, while allowing Toronto to shoot 56.8%, including a whopping 86 points in the paint.\nAfter the game, Young issued a stern reminder , which underscored his frustration.\n“Trae said the Hawks players need to know that the opposing scouting report says to try to score on them in transition and adjust accordingly,” said the 27-year-old guard, as quoted by Hawks reporter Kevin Chouinard.\nYoung’s comment could open a can of worms, as his teammates might take it the wrong way. But for the four-time All-Star, he knows that they have to be accountable all the time, especially after an embarrassing loss. They went down by as much as 29 points against the Raptors.\nYoung had 22 points on 5-of-14 shooting on top of five assists. The Hawks were led by Jalen Johnson, who tallied 22 points, seven rebounds, and eight assists.\nKristaps Porzingis collected 20 points, seven rebounds, and two blocks in his debut for Atlanta .\nThe Raptors outrebounded the Hawks, 54-34. They also had 36 assists and scored 34 points off fastbreaks .\n“I don’t think there’s too many positives you can take away from tonight,” added Young, as quoted by Hawks reporter Donnell Suggs.\nAtlanta will look to bounce back on Friday versus the Orlando Magic.",
