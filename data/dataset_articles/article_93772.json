  "text": "Pirates edged by Hornets, 1-0\nThe Pirates fell to the Hornets 1-0 in a tightly contested match, with Fullerton scoring the only goal in the first half. Josiahs Palacios netted the goal in the 34th minute, assisted by Cisco Torres, capitalizing on a turnover by the Pirates. Despite having more shots on goal, Orange Coast was unable to find the back of the net, with their best opportunity thwarted by a no-call on a foul. Both teams had limited scoring chances, but Fullerton's defense held strong, securing the shutout. The Pirates will next face Irvine Valley at home on Friday.\n- Fullerton had 9 shots, with 3 on target.\n- Orange Coast recorded 10 shots, with 5 on target.\n- Both teams committed 13 fouls during the match.\n- Fullerton's goalkeeper made 5 saves to preserve the shutout.\nThe match featured a controversial no-call during the Pirates' best chance to equalize, raising questions about officiating consistency. While both teams struggled in creating significant scoring opportunities, the inability to capitalize on critical moments highlighted the challenges faced by the Pirates this season.\nState of Play- The Pirates currently hold a record of 1-9-3, struggling in the Orange Empire Conference with a 0-6-1 conference record.\n- Fullerton now stands at 3-6-5, with a stronger conference presence at 2-2-3.\nFollowing this defeat, Orange Coast will face Irvine Valley on Friday, seeking to improve their performance and gain much-needed points in the conference standings.\nBottom LineThe Pirates' inability to convert key opportunities continues to hinder their progress, but the strong overall performance suggests potential for improvement as they prepare for upcoming matches.\nRead more at Orange Coast College Athletics\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
