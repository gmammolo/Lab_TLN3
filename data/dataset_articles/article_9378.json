  "text": "A 22-year-old female was rescued in an incredible rescue after being washed 20 miles downriver by the catastrophic Texas floods. As told by KENS 5, the strong flash floods swept her away from her family’s camp site in Kerr County, leaving her hanging onto a tree for four hours before rescuers showed up.\nOne of Center Point’s residents, Carl, was coming out into his backyard about 8 am on Friday, July 4, when he heard frantic screams. Glancing around, he noticed the young woman clinging to a giant cypress tree along Lion’s Park Dam, the water crashing underneath her.\n“It was a miracle,” said Carl. “There’s no other way to describe it.”\nHours on the Tree Before Rescue\nThe female is said to have gone 20 miles downstream before clutched onto the tree, where she clung for hours. While emergency calls were not succeeding, Carl stopped a passing police car for help. Two rescue boats finally arrived. By then, the water had receded, leaving her 12 feet in the air. She eventually fell safely into one of the boats and was taken ashore.\n“We brought her into our home and clothed her and offered her something to drink. We talked with her a long time,” Carl said.\nFamily Carried Away Too\nCarl’s family members reported that the woman was camping with her parents, sister, aunt, and uncle when tragedy occurred. She was said to have been swept away with both parents from her car but became separated. The whereabouts of her family members are unknown.\nThe young woman sustained only minor injuries despite the terrifying ordeal.",
