  "text": "Why Did Rohit Sharma & Virat Kohli Flop in Perth? Australian Legend Says THIS Is the Reason\nThe 1st ODI between India and Australia in Perth on October 19 was the international return of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli after seven months. But it was not the kind of comeback Indian fans wanted or expected as both legends failed with the bat. ‘Hitman’ made eight while ‘King’ fell for zero.\nWhy Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli Fail in Perth?\nSo what went wrong? Why did they fail? Well, former Aussie pacer Glenn Mcgrath has a rather blunt take on the matter. According to the three-time ODI World Cup winner, both these players have not had any game time and that is why they may have been rusty. Rohit and Kohli have retired from the other formats so that means they only play ODIs. India’s last ODI before the series Down Under was the Champions Trophy final vs New Zealand on March 9.\n\"There was a lot of talk going into the match about the two greats, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. They've not had a lot of cricket under their belt. And I think they found out a little bit on a pitch that has got a little bit more pace and a lot more bounce than what they're used to back in India,\" he said while speaking on the Fast Bowling Cartel YouTube channel.\nHowever, India’s batting coach Sitanshu Kotak feels that it was not so as both Rohit and Kohli had played the IPL which was from late March to early June. It should have ended in late May but due to the military hostilities with Pakistan, the tournament had to be put on hold.\n\"I do not think so. They played the IPL. The preparation has been very good. I think it was the weather. It would have been the same if Australia had come out to bat first. It is not easy when there are four or five interruptions and every two overs you are going in and coming back out,\" he said.\n\"Both of them are very experienced. Before coming to Australia, they had proper preparation. I think it is too early to judge them. They just retired from Test cricket. Coming into the series, we were aware of their fitness levels and the preparation work they had been doing. We had access to their videos from the NCA. With such senior players, you do not need to step in right away if you see they are doing the right things. If you try to get involved too much, that might not be the best approach,\" he added.\nRohit Sharma and Virat Kohli’s ODI Future Uncertain\nRohit and Kohli are both in the twilight of their careers. The former is 38 and has been around for 18 years while the latter is almost 37 and has played for 17 years. Will they both make it to the 2027 ODI World Cup? The future is uncertain. An ODI retirement also means an international farewell for the duo.\nIndia’s ODI Success On Australian Soil\nIndia’s next game vs Australia is in Adelaide on October 23 and they need to win to take it to the decider on October 25 in Sydney. India’s only bilateral ODI series win in Australia was a 2-1 victory under Virat Kohli in 2019. Under MS Dhoni in 2008, they won a tri-series. Under Sunil Gavaskar, India won their only multi-nation tournament Down Under in 1985.",
