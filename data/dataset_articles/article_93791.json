This is a must-win game for India, as a loss here would mean that they would lose the series with a match to go. All eyes were on Virat Kohli, especially after he scored a duck in the first ODI, which was his return to international cricket after seven months.

For context, the series against Australia is the 75th ODI series that Kohli is playing in his storied career.\nRohit Sharma Creates History\nWhile Virat Kohli got out for a duck, Rohit Sharma managed to create history in the second ODI vs Australia\nWhen Rohit Sharma hit his first boundary of the series in his 2nd ODI, he became the first Indian batter in history to score 1000 runs against Australia in Australia. He has scored four fifties and two hundreds against Australia Down Under as well.\nShaunak Ghosh author\nShaunak Ghosh is a Senior Sports Correspondent at Timesnownews with over seven years of experience in print and digital journalism.
