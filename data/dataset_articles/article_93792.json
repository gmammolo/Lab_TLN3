  "text": "Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois criticizes Javier Tebas, the Spanish league president, over playing a regular-season game in Miami and censoring protests. He insists on fairness, calling for home and away matches. The Miami game debate highlights transparency issues and players' concerns over the decision-making process. Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has publicly criticized Spanish league president Javier Tebas for the controversial decision to hold a regular-season game in Miami this December. Courtois expressed discontent with how protests against the Villarreal-Barcelona game were censored, stating that the fairness of competition is compromised when matches are not played both home and away. Courtois highlighted the lack of transparency in the decision-making process regarding the Miami game, arguing that players were excluded from negotiations, contrasting it with the open practices of American sports leagues.
