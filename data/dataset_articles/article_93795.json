  "text": "[OSEN=Kang Pil-joo Reporter] The sports industry’s zero-tolerance principle, which does not forgive even a single act of violence, has been applied for the first time.The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism announced on the 22nd that it has revoked the qualification of a middle school ssireum (Korean wrestling) team coach confirmed to have assaulted an athlete, in accordance with the 'National Sports Promotion Act.'This measure was finalized after an investigation by the Sports Ethics Center and deliberation by the Sports Instructor Qualification Management Committee. It is the first case applying the 'one-strike-out principle'—announced in August by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism through its 'Direction for Eradicating (Sexual) Violence in Sports'—which states that even a single act of violence will lead to permanent expulsion from the sports industry.The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism convened the Sports Instructor Qualification Management Committee on the 21st, thoroughly deliberating the severity of the case after confirming that the coach assaulted an athlete over training attitude issues. The committee resolved to revoke the qualification under the strict conclusion that 'violence cannot be justified under any coaching pretext.'The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism plans to more vigorously enforce the one-strike-out principle following this qualification revocation. First, during the 'Special Reporting Period for Sports Violence' operated for one month last September, 198 cases of human rights violations and corruption were reported through the Sports Ethics Center.The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism will closely cooperate with the police to ensure swift investigations and victim relief, and based on the results, it will demand immediate disciplinary action and qualification revocation for violent perpetrators, among other strong measures.For sports organizations that inadequately or passively respond to disciplinary actions or qualification management for violent coaches, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism will actively review all possible administrative measures, including requesting reconsideration under the 'National Sports Promotion Act' and restricting financial support if unaddressed.Additionally, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism will thoroughly manage and supervise the implementation of effective measures on-site in accordance with the 'zero-tolerance and exemplary punishment' principle, which does not tolerate even a single act of violence.Starting next year, it plans to expand the human rights protection officer system to establish a framework for regular inspections of school sports teams and various competitions, and mandate violence and sexual violence prevention education for all athletes. Furthermore, it will significantly strengthen preemptive prevention functions by conducting a full-scale survey on human rights violations in the sports industry.Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism Minister Choi Hwi-young plans to visit the Sports Ethics Center in person after this qualification revocation to encourage employees working on violence eradication tasks and inspect victim protection and recurrence prevention systems. The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism intends to continue pushing for practical measures that allow all athletes to train in a safe and respectful environment. /letmeout@osen.co.kr",
