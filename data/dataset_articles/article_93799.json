  "text": "Manchester United Women midfielder Jess Park withdrew from the Lionesses squad after suffering a concussion in a 4-1 win over Everton in Barclays Women’s Super League play, the club confirmed on Wednesday.\nJess Park withdraws from England duty to continue concussion recovery\nPark, who scored twice against the Toffees in a late cameo, did not travel with United for a 1-0 win over Atletico Madrid in Spain in UEFA Champions League action the following week. She has not trained since the incident, and despite reporting to England camp on Monday, has now taken some more time off to rest and recuperate before returning to action for the Reds.\nPark, 24, signed for United in an unusual swap deal with cross-town rivals, Manchester City. The deal saw Grace Clinton join the Blues in the other direction, but has yielded positive results for United and Park so far. She has made nine appearances since joining the club, scoring three goals and providing an assist as United have yet to lose in WSL play. She also helped United qualify for the UEFA Champions League group stage for the first time in its history, and the Reds have two wins in two matches so far in Europe.\nThe hope now is that Park can return to action at the beginning of November as United travel to the south coast for a match against Brighton & Hove Albion. United returns to Champions League play at Old Trafford against Paris Saint-Germain 10 days after that, an all-hands-on-deck match to make a statement of intent in Europe against the side that knocked the Reds out of qualifying two years ago.",
