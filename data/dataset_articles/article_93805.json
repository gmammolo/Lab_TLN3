  "text": "Virat Kohli was dismissed for a duck for the second consecutive time in the IND vs AUS ODI series. In the second match at the Adelaide Oval, Kohli faced four balls and was dismissed by fast bowler Xavier Bartlett . The delivery came in after pitching, and Virat missed it completely. In the series opener at the Optus Stadium in Perth, he was in the middle for 8 balls and was sent back by Mitchell Starc.\nThe star batter has looked rusty and out of touch despite making big claims of not needing match time, considering 15 years of non-stop cricket. His place is on the line, and he may announce his retirement after the third and final contest, as selectors and team management are looking at younger players.\nMeanwhile, captain Shubman Gill was the first batter to depart after the Aussie pacers didn’t give scoring opportunities to the rival batters. Gill tried to take on Bartlett, but his missed time shot went towards the mid-off area, where Mitchell Marsh completed a good catch.\nEarlier, Marsh won the toss and invited India to bat first.\nPlaying XIs Australia: Mitch Marsh (captain), Travis Head, Matthew Short, Matthew Renshaw, Alex Carey, Cooper Connolly, Mitchell Owen, Xavier Bartlett, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood.\nIndia: Shubman Gill (captain), Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, K.L. Rahul, Washington Sundar, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammed Siraj.",
