  "text": "LYNNVILLE – Perry Central lost 3-0 in the Indiana High School Athletic Association Class 2A volleyball sectional championship on Saturday against Tecumseh as the experience difference showed itself in key moments of the game leading to the Commodores’ loss.\nThe Commodores beat Forest Park 3-1 to earn their spot against the Braves who are ranked 5th in class 2A.\nCommodore coach Melissa James called the semifinal match a big win for their program as they were able to avenge a loss to the Rangers from earlier in the season.\nAnother slow start hurt Perry Central in the championship against Tecumseh. They fell behind 10-6 after a kill from Shae Bailey.\nBryn Yeager responded by scoring two straight points for Perry Central, but the momentum would quickly stall.\nJames called a timeout after her team found themselves in a 15-8 hole.\nTecumseh came out of that timeout swinging though. They went on a five-point rally to help lead them to a 25-12 victory.\n“I thought our inexperience led to the slow start,” James said. “We’ve also got to improve with our second touch on the ball, that was really how they beat us.”\nBoth teams would go on extended rallies in the second set. They each would trade two-point leads until late in the set.\nKelsey Marx had a kill to give the Braves an 18-16 lead. From there, Tecumseh extended their lead and won the set 25-20.\n“We started having our middle back cover line a little bit better,” James continued, “We didn’t make big adjustments, it was mostly just our own errors that were the problem.”\nPerry Central was down four points quickly in the third set but fought their way back into the set.\nMya Litherland scored two of her three aces of the night to help tie the game at 11. The Commodores would then take a commanding lead.\nTwo Masen Labhart kills sandwiched back-to-back aces from Kaitlyn Goffinet giving Perry Central a 19-14 advantage.\nThe Braves didn’t flinch while facing their biggest deficit of the night. Tecumseh would outscore the Commodores 9-1 and win the set 25-20.\n“I was really proud of our kids for coming out and fighting,” James said. “I told them we went toe to toe with one of the top teams in the state and we held our own.”\nLabhart led Perry Central with 10 kills. Litherland was the team’s assist leader with 13 and Goffinet led the Commodores with 17 digs.\nJames will return her entire roster next year. She didn’t understate the importance of the experience gained from their run to the sectional championship.\n“That was a big deal for us, we’ve got some young players,” James said. “They were disappointed but also proud of themselves for hanging in there.”\n“This was a big growth year for us, we grew huge leaps from last year to this year,” James continued. “I’m hoping that if we can make that much growth again next year that we will be a whole new team.”",
