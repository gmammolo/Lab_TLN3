  "text": "In the second ODI match against Australia, Team Indias stalwart Virat Kohli returned to the pavilion without scoring any runs. His innings ended with a four-ball duck, and he was dismissed by Xavier Bartlett through LBW. This also marked the right-handers second duck in the ongoing 50-over format series. Earlier, in the series-opening match at the Optus Stadium in Perth, Kohli was dismissed on an eight-ball duck. What took the fans by surprise was the way that Virat waved at the Australian crowd while returning to the pavilion in Adelaide. Despite departing on a duck, the 36-year-old cricketer received a standing ovation from the crowd in the second ODI match at the Adelaide Oval. Responding to the crowd, Kohli waved at them, which in turn sparked his retirement speculation from international cricket. An Instagram retirement is coming today it seems. The ground where he played his greatest innings will be ground where he retired. Thank you #ViratKohli #INDvsAUS #AUSvIND pic.twitter.com/QyiMag0J3T The last dance (@26lastdance) October 23, 2025 Check the end of the video. Its not good news for cricket fans. #ViratKohli gesture at the end probably means he is announcing retirement from cricket. #INDvsAUS #AUSvIND pic.twitter.com/ApjNCoWOkr The last dance (@26lastdance) October 23, 2025 Currently, Virat Kohli is playing just one format, One-Day Internationals (ODIs). The Delhi-born cricketer had announced his retirement from the shortest format of the game after Team Indias T20 World Cup 2024 triumph. He also drew curtains on his longest format career before the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy earlier in the year. However, the Men in Blue are yet to play the third ODI against the Aussies in the ongoing series. The third and final match of the ODI series is scheduled to be played on October 25 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Additionally, there have been a lot of debates surrounding Kohli and Rohit Sharmas place in Indias squad for the ODI World Cup 2027. Former cricketers and pundits have expressed mixed opinions on the star duos future in the side and have urged them to play domestic cricket to maintain their match fitness and form. Before the start of the three-match ODI series against the Aussies, Shubman Gill was appointed as Team Indias new 50-over format captain by replacing Rohit. Currently, the 26-year-old has been in charge of Indias ODI and Test teams. Suryakumar Yadav continues to lead the Indian team in the shortest format of the game. After the conclusion of the ongoing ODI series, both teams will clash against each other in the five-match T20I series.",
