  "text": "The International Olympic Committee has recommended halting sports events in Indonesia after the country denied visas to Israeli athletes for the gymnastics world championships. The IOC is ceasing dialogue with Indonesia on hosting future Olympics until it guarantees access for athletes of all nationalities. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has recommended that global sports federations desist from organizing events in Indonesia after the country refused entry to Israeli athletes for the ongoing gymnastics world championships in Jakarta. The IOC's executive board announced the decision on Wednesday, also declaring an end to any discussions with Indonesia regarding future Olympic events. The move follows Indonesia's denial of visas to Israeli athletes, including 2020 Olympic gold medalist Artem Dolgopyat, sidelining them from the event. Indonesia, a predominantly Muslim country with a strong pro-Palestinian stance, faces opposition within its borders over Israeli competitors. The IOC emphasized non-discrimination in sports, suspending talks with Indonesia until all athletes receive entry guarantees. This decision reflects ongoing global challenges regarding athletes' access to competitions. (With inputs from agencies.)",
