  "text": "LEOPOLD – Perry Central dropped its last game of the Patoka Lake Conference football regular season to Mitchell 23-20 on Friday. The Commodores played well, but a few mistakes ended up being the difference in the game.\nThe run game was working early for Perry Central. They were able to move the ball down the field on their first few possessions, but each drive would eventually stall out.",
