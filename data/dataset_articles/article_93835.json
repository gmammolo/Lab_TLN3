  "text": "Virat Kohli 's return to international cricket continued to be a horrid affair as he fell for second consecutive duck , a first in his career, during the second ODI against Australia at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday. His stay in the middle was cut short as he was dismissed for a duck by Xavier Bartlett .\nTired of too many ads? go ad free now Bartlett's devastating bowling saw him dismiss both Indian skipper Shubman Gill for 9 and Kohli in the same over, dealing early blows to the Indian batting lineup. Why Virat Kohli in India XI for World Cup 2027 will be bad news | Greenstone Lobo predicts LIVE: India vs Australia 2nd ODI As Kohli walked back, he appeared to lift his gloves up in appreciation of the crowd that came out to cheer and support the Indian team in numbers. Whether that hand gesture is merely an indication of his gratitude to the fans or something bigger remains to be seen.\nKohli's dismissal came during his highly anticipated return to competitive cricket alongside Rohit Sharma, who had recently retired from Test cricket. Despite this setback, Kohli's previous record at Adelaide Oval in ODIs remains impressive, with 244 runs in four innings at an average of 61.00, including two centuries. His highest score at the venue stands at 107. One of Kohli's Adelaide centuries holds historical significance as it came against Pakistan during the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup, making him the first Indian to score a World Cup century against their arch-rivals.\nKohli currently shares a remarkable record with Sachin Tendulkar for most centuries in a single format. Both cricketers have 51 centuries each - Kohli in ODIs and Tendulkar in Tests. A potential next century would make Kohli the sole record holder for most centuries in a single format with 52 ODI tons. The match began with Australian captain Mitchell Marsh winning the toss and choosing to bowl first. Australia currently lead the three-match series 1-0 after securing a seven-wicket victory in the opening match at Perth Stadium.\nCatch Lovlina Borgohain's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 5.
