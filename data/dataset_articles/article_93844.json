  "text": "Virat Kohli declares retirement in Adelaide\nMukesh Singh\nPublished - 23 Oct 2025, 10:27 AM | Updated - 23 Oct 2025, 10:30 AM\nVirat Kohli, on Thursday (October 23), once again disappointed with the bat during the ongoing second ODI between India and Australia at the Adelaide Oval.\nThe former India skipper started the ongoing tour with an eight-ball duck in the first ODI. He chased a wide delivery outside the off stump from Mitchell Starc and ended up edging the ball straight to the fielder at backward point.\nAnother flop show for the King\nAlso Read: \"Remove Shubman Gill\"- Twitter reacts after another poor outing vs Australia\nWhile the fans were waiting for Virat Kohli to make amends with the bat in the ongoing game, the right-handed batsman flopped once again. He lasted only 4 balls and could not even open his account as Xavier Bartlett dismissed him for a duck in the 7th over. He was out lbw after being beaten by a sharp, incoming delivery.\nVIRAT KOHLI GONE FOR HIS SECOND DUCK OF THE SERIES!\n— cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau)[#AUSvIND]|[#PlayoftheDay]|[@BKTtires][pic.twitter.com/jqIdvMeX9T][October 23, 2025]\nVirat Kohli hints at retirement\nVirat Kohli has left the fans not only intrigued but worried as well after making an unexpected gesture following his dismissal in Adelaide.

Captain Shubman Gill and Virat were dismissed by Xavier Bartlett in the 7th over.\nAt the time of writing this report, India were on 33/2 after 11 overs. Former captain Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer were batting in the middle for the Men in Blue. The onus will be on the experienced duo to guide the team to a big total.
