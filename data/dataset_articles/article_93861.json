  "text": "Akshita Patel Shubman Gill dismissed on 9 in 2nd ODI [Source: @LegendDhonii/X.com]\nIndian captain Shubman Gill was dismissed on 9 off 9 balls in the 2nd ODI against Australia at Adelaide. His back-to-back cheap dismissals left fans disappointed as they lashed out at him on social media.\nIndia batted first on the fresh wicket of Adelaide, with Rohit Sharma walking out to open with Gill. Both had a steady start, but the newly crowned skipper wasted his wicket.",
