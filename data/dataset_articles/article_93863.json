  "text": "Royals Narrowly Lose to North Florida Despite Strong Second Half\nQueens University of Charlotte fell 2-1 to North Florida in a closely contested match. After conceding a goal in the first half, the Royals rallied to equalize in the second half but were thwarted by a late goal from North Florida. This loss marks the Royals' ninth match decided by one goal this season.\n- Hannah Dike-Lawlor made six saves on 18 shots faced.\n- Queens registered just two shots on target throughout the match.\n- The Royals currently hold a record of 3-10-4, with a conference record of 2-6-1 in ASUN.\n- This match is Queens' fifth one-goal loss at home this season, highlighting their struggles in close games.\nQueens will conclude the regular season on Saturday, October 25, against Jacksonville at home, aiming to improve their ASUN standing with a strong performance.\nBottom LineThe Royals need to translate their defensive resilience and offensive opportunity into scoring as they approach the end of the season, especially in tight matchups where every goal counts.\nRead more at Queens University of Charlotte Athletics\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
