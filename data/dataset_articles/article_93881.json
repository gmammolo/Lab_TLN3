  "text": "Rohit Deliberately Underperforming Under Gill's Leadership? Gavaskar Breaks Silence\nOn October 19, Rohit Sharma played his first ODI under Shubman Gill. Gill was the one who replaced him as skipper and this was his international return after more than seven months. ‘Hitman’ did not have a dream comeback as he perished for just eight runs against his name. This set social media on fire as people alleged that he failed intentionally because he was unhappy about being replaced as captain by Gill.\nNow Indian legend Sunil Gavaskar has come out to bat for Rohit and said that it was not so. He said that no player would deliberately fail because that would put his place in the side in jeopardy. He made a pretty good point.\n\"In Indian cricket, there’s a persistent myth that a player who loses the captaincy might underperform to undermine the new skipper. Nothing could be further from the truth. If a former captain doesn’t perform, he could be out of the team entirely. No player, regardless of personal feelings, would deliberately throw a game,\" he wrote in his Sportstar column.\n\"Questions have been raised about whether Gill can handle two former captains in his team. But he has made it clear that his relationship with Rohit and Virat hasn’t changed with his new role,” he added.\n“In fact, having them around is a bonus. Both are willing to offer advice when needed, and there’s no better support for a debutant captain than two of India’s greatest ODI players by his side,” he went on to say.\nRohit’s last match as ODI skipper saw India win the Champions Trophy on March 9. On May 7, he announced his Test retirement and he had already quit T20Is on June 29, 2024. As a captain, Rohit led India to four ICC finals in five tournaments and won two of them. Now at 38, having played for 18 years, he is in the twilight of his career and faces a race against time to be available for the 2027 ODI World Cup.",
