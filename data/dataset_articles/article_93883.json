  "text": "Shubman Gill attacked by a Pakistan fan in Adelaide\nSai Vaitla\nPublished - 23 Oct 2025, 10:27 AM | Updated - 23 Oct 2025, 10:30 AM\nTeam India opener Shubman Gill is leading the side in the second ODI of the three-match series against Australia at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday, October 23. Ahead of the match, a fan shook hands with Gill and unexpectedly shouted “Pakistan Zindabad,” and the video grabbed attention on social media.\nGill struggled to make an impact in his first match as India’s ODI captain. The 26-year-old batter scored only 10 runs at the Optus Stadium in Perth on Sunday. Notably, the entire batting lineup failed against a quality Australian bowling attack, and the visitors suffered a seven-wicket defeat in the rain-curtailed game.\nWatch: Shubman Gill Surprised by Fan Chant in Adelaide, Maintains Composure\nShubman Gill was left visibly surprised during a casual stroll in Adelaide. The Indian captain, dressed in a black hoodie and sky-blue jeans, was walking peacefully through the city alongside teammates, including pacer Harshit Rana, when a fan approached him for a handshake.\nGill extended his hand, but the moment quickly turned awkward as the fan suddenly shouted, “Pakistan Zindabad.” The unexpected chant left Gill stunned. However, he maintained his composure, quietly pulled back his hand, and walked away without saying a word.\nA Pakistani fan met Shubman Gill in Adelaide and said, \"Pakistan Zindabad.\"\n— Sheri. (@CallMeSheri1_)[pic.twitter.com/sfoqpeLOi0][October 22, 2025]\nThe entire incident was captured on video and went viral across social media platforms. Fans praised Gill for his dignified response towards the Pakistani fan.\nIndia Avoided Handshakes with Pakistan in Asia Cup 2025 Amid Heightened Tensions\nThe incident comes at a time following the Asia Cup 2025, during which the Indian cricket team avoided shaking hands with Pakistani players. That episode had already sparked debates over sportsmanship and the influence of political tensions on cricketing interactions.\nThe video has reignited discussions about the difficulties public figures face in casual fan interactions. Notably, the team, led by Suryakumar Yadav, defeated Pakistan in all three encounters, including the final, during the continental tournament.\nIt was the first cricket tournament between India and Pakistan following the Pahalgam terror attack in April. There were calls from former cricketers and fans to boycott the event; however, the BCCI opted to play the tournament, and players avoided the customary handshake throughout the competition.\nShubman Gill & Abhishek Sharma Involved In Heated Exchange With Haris Rauf\nShubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma got into a heated exchange with Pakistan’s pacer Haris Rauf in the Asia Cup 2025 Super 4 match in Dubai. The incident occurred after Gill’s boundary off Rauf during India’s chase of 172 runs.\nThe altercation began in the early overs of India’s innings. After Gill smashed the boundary, Rauf responded with an aggressive reaction. The situation quickly intensified as Sharma, at the non-striker’s end, backed his partner, leading to a verbal confrontation.\nUmpires intervened to calm the players, but the moment highlighted the high-pressure atmosphere of India-Pakistan encounters. The Men in Blue secured the victory over their archrivals in the Super 4 clash.\nAlso read: Ishan Kishan IPL stocks soar high!! 3 teams enter direct fight with SRH for trade\nAbout the Author\nSai Vaitla is an author at Cricketaddictor and he has been working since September 2022.\nSai Vaitla...\nRead more",
