Mandatory Credit: David Reginek-Imagn Images By David Reginek, David Reginek-Imagn Images The NFL season will sometimes show us what we want to see from players; other times, we may see something bad when it isn't there. For fans and media, it's essential to have a way to verify and balance information to prevent favoritism or bias from being portrayed in a negative light.\nThanks to PFF, we will always have an extra set of eyes to examine the football game.\nThe Bucs had few high grades or performances in Week 7 of the regular season. The grades could be some of the highest we have ever seen in the history of PFF.\nHere are the best and worst from the PFF grades for the Bucs' loss to the Lions .\nBest offensive grades OT Tristan Wirfs 86.9\nWR Tez Johnson 78\nTE Cade Otton 67.7\nG Ben Bredeson 66.7\nWR Emeka Egbuka 63.7\nWorst offensive grades C Graham Barton 44.1\nQB Baker Mayfield 46.7\nG Michael Jordan 49.9\nWR Mike Evans 51.5\nRB Sean Tucker 53.2\nRushing grades RB Rachaad White 68.6\nQB Teddy Bridgewater 60\nRB Sean Tucker 59.4\nBest run blocking grades OT Tristan Wirfs 91.3\nWR Ryan Miller 76.8\nOT Charlie Heck 68.6\nWR Kameron Johnson 60.4\nWR Emeka Egbuka 60.3\nWorst run blocking grades C Graham Barton 46.3\nG Michael Jordan 46.7\nG Ben Bredeson 48.7\nTE Cade Otton 52.9\nWR Tez Johnson 59.3\nBest pass blocking grades G Ben Bredeson 86.2\nOT Tristan Wirfs 80.5\nTE Payne Durham 73.2\nTE Cade Otton 71.5\nWR Sterling Shepard 66.3\nWorst pass blocking grades RB Sean Tucker 19.1\nC Graham Barton 32.7\nG Michael Jordan 49.2\nOT Charlie Heck 54.1\nRB Rachaad White 59.3\nBest defensive grades DL Vita Vea 73\nCB Zyon McCollum 70.3\nDL Anthony Nelson 70.3\nLB Yaya Diaby 70.1\nCB Tykee Smith 67.8\nWorst defensive grades DL Greg Gaines 30.1\nCB Jacob Parrish 33.4\nDL Elijah Simmons 40.5\nLB Haason Reddick 42.6\nDL Logan Hall 54.3\nBest run defense grades CB Tykee Smith 80.7\nCB Jacob Parrish 80.7\nCB Jamel Dean 73.7\nLB Yaya Diaby 70.6\nLB SirVocea Dennis 68.8\nWorst run defense grades DL Greg Gaines 32.6\nS Antoine Winfield Jr. 36.7\nDL Elijah Simmons 39.7\nCB Zyon McCollum 45.9\nLB Haason Reddick 49.6\nBest pass rush grades DL Vita Vea 73.4\nDL Elijah Roberts 69.9\nLB SirVocea Dennis 67.9\nDL Anthony Nelson 67.8\nDL Elijah Simmons 67\nWorst pass rush grades S Antoine Winfield Jr. 54.8\nLB Chris Braswell 55.9\nLB Haason Reddick 56.6\nDL Logan Hall 57\nDL Greg Gaines 57.4\nBest coverage grades CB Zyon McCollum 76.6\nLB Lavonte David 70.7\nS Antoine Winfield Jr. 66.7\nLB Chris Braswell 63.9\nLB Yaya Diaby 63.1\nWorst coverage grades CB Jacob Parrish 28.8\nLB Haason Reddick 36.9\nLB SirVocea Dennis 43.6\nCB Jamel Dean 49.4\nCB Tykee Smith 55.2\nThis article originally appeared on Bucs Wire: PFF grades from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Week 7 loss to the Detroit Lions\n1",
