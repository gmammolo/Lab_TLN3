  "text": "It was as if the Celtics needed this game to verify they could succeed without Jayson Tatum, who could only watch from the bench donned in a pastel suit and take selfies with fans.\nThe season goes on, and this retooled roster played good enough for 44 minutes Wednesday night at TD Garden to earn an impressive opening win over the 76ers. Until the Celtics sputtered down the stretch, with a defense that couldn’t get stops and an offense that committed several errors and forced bad shots. The result was a frustrating, 117-116 loss in a game the Celtics almost needed to feel good about their restart.\nInstead, they’ll head to New York to face the Knicks on Friday knowing they are a spirited but flawed team.\nAdvertisement\nThe Celtics won the rebounding battle, limited turnovers, and were active on defense — but the mistakes were just too numerous. And if you were wondering whether this new edition would attempt fewer 3-pointers because it lost four top shooters, the answer was a resounding no.\nNearly 50 percent of the Celtics’ shot attempts were threes and they made just 11 of 43. And while the right players took those shots — Derrick White and Payton Pritchard were a combined 5 for 20 — they still caromed off the rim and left Boston vulnerable for a rally.\nVulnerability is going to be a constant theme in this transition season. While the Celtics entered nearly every game for the past 10 years with a better than average chance to win, that won’t be the case this year. They’ll be heavy underdogs at New York. A team filled with veterans that won a championship will have to collectively gain confidence because this iteration of the Celtics has yet to accomplish anything.\nAdvertisement\nJaylen Brown tries to get past the Sixers' Quentin Grimes (left) and Dominick Barlow. Danielle Parhizkaran/Globe Staff A win in the opener would have been a nice start, even if Joel Embiid made just one shot in 20 minutes. The Celtics almost withstood a 40-point night from Tyrese Maxey and a record-breaking 34-point effort from rookie VJ Edgecombe in his NBA debut. They were precariously close to finishing opening night feeling good about themselves, picking up that morsel of certainty needed for a team that doesn’t compare to its previous championship form.\n“Definitely a winnable game for us,” Jaylen Brown said. “We had some opportunities. It’s a learning experience. It’s going to be a learning experience from Day One. We have a bunch of new guys. We’re playing a new style. I thought we played hard. I thought we played a winnable game but it was some crucial errors that cost us.”\nIn his first game as the primary offensive option, Brown finished with 25 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 assists in 36 minutes. But he committed three of the Celtics’ 12 fouls in that final period, when they lost all their principles and blew a 9-point lead with 3:47 left.\nThis team has the same late-game struggles as last year’s squad. The 76ers countered with a 15-2 run and the Celtics shot 1 for 6 with two turnovers. Once again, they were hoping the visitors would fold, falling into the narrative that the Celtics needed this win more. Boston backed into adversity in the final minutes instead of seizing the moment.\nA team still trying to find its swagger and identity played like a bunch of JV players when it counted. The hope is the Celtics learn from this experience, but there could be numerous learning opportunities in the first few months as chemistry develops.\nAdvertisement\n“We [have] a new group that’s still figuring things out,” Brown said. “Some of these other teams have played together for a little bit more [time]. It’s going to be some ups and downs but I’m looking forward to it.”\nBrown and coach Joe Mazzulla said the foundation for this team, while still cementing, was laid weeks ago when training camp began. It was laid during a difficult and interesting practice regimen that included a fullcourt press drill using a football. It was laid when Mazzulla reached out to the team’s newest acquisitions and developed personal plans about how they can improve and contribute.\nThat arduous work regimen nearly paid off on opening night, but this team hasn’t learned how to win because the players don’t have enough reps together.\n“We’ll learn from this,” Brown said. “We’ll learn how to close, we’ll learn those spots where we can be better. I’m not looking for my guys to hang their heads whatsoever. We’ll just get ready for the next one, on the road for the first time. It’s going to be a good test for our group.\n“Being consistent is something [that] for a young player is hard, a testament to what the NBA is about. Being able to find ways to win is ultimately what it’s going to come down to. I’m looking forward to seeing what we’re made of.\nThe Celtics won’t know entirely until perhaps the new year. They are going to play a lot of close games. They are going to make a plethora of mistakes, and produce encouraging performances mixed with victorious ones.\nIt’s going to require some patience and compassion because regardless of how many players from the title team are still here, they’ll have to fuse together with their new teammates and form a brand new element. That’s not going to happen in one night, regardless of how promising the performance.\nAdvertisement",
