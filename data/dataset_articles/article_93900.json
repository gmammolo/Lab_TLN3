  "text": "Los Angeles Lakers fans would love to forget Russell Westbrook’s nightmare stint with the franchise, but they got a chuckle out of his debut with the rival Kings. Fans knew it would be hilarious, and they didn’t have to wait beyond opening night. The future Hall of Famer went two of eight from the field as the Kings lost to the retooling Suns.\nWestbrook finished with six points, six rebounds, one assist, one block, and two turnovers in 19 minutes of action. He missed both his 3-point attempts, which comes as zero surprise for the career 30.5 percent shooter from outside. Things have been going downhill for years, but they may have reached a new low for the 36-year-old.\nThe Kings' roster doesn’t make sense. They are collecting a bunch of score-first options that struggle on defense. Westbrook will bring energy and all-out play, but he won’t help Sacramento win. For a roster loaded with veterans, the comedy is just beginning for purple and gold supporters.\nLakers fans are dying laughing at Russell Westbrook’s nightmare Kings debut\nRuss having more turnovers than assists and connecting on just two of his eight field goals brings back all the problems Lakers fans remember. The head-scratching turnovers, poor shot selection, and defensive lapses prevented things from working in Los Angeles. Since leaving the Lakers, Westbrook failed to make things work on the Clippers and Nuggets. Westbrook didn't sign until late in the offseason. This may be his last NBA chance, and fans already know how it ends.\nWestbrook is a future Hall of Famer. He deservingly won MVP in 2017 and is a nine-time All-Star. There is no questioning his peak, but Russ hasn’t been that player since 2020. Father Time is undefeated, and it has certainly caught up to Westbrook.\nLakers fans can’t believe the Kings sold themselves on the 36-year-old being an impact player on a team looking to contend. He has played for six different teams in the last seven years for several reasons. Westbrook makes far too many head-scratching plays at this stage, and Kings fans will soon be living that nightmare on a nightly basis.\nThere was no surprise in Los Angeles about Westbrook’s debut with the Kings. It was his first action as the future Hall of Famer signed in Sacramento after the preseason. There was likely some rust, but expecting the 36-year-old to suddenly bounce back is foolish.\nLos Angeles Lakers fans will be laughing at the rival Sacramento Kings all season for signing Russell Westbrook. It will end in disaster just like it did in purple and gold. Sacramento will learn the hard way, and Lakers supporters should enjoy every second of it.",
