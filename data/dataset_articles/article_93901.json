  "text": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa acknowledged Wednesday that he needs to be better after a rough outing in Cleveland — one that included three interceptions, a benching, and an unusually quiet day from wide receiver Jaylen Waddle.\n“I’m frustrated about those and I’ve got to do something about that, that’s for sure,” Tagovailoa said of his turnovers as the Dolphins prepare to face the Atlanta Falcons (3-3) on Sunday at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. “I can’t turn the ball over and expect to win the game.”\nTagovailoa’s struggles against the Browns led to seventh-round rookie Quinn Ewers taking over in the fourth quarter of Miami’s 31-6 loss.\nMeanwhile, Waddle finished with just one catch for 15 yards — both season lows — and Tagovailoa said part of the problem came down to his ability to see through traffic.\n“I think with that, some of it has to do with being able to see guys with their guys also up front and our guys,” Tagovailoa said. “I’m not the tallest guy in the back there either, so being able to see and then sometimes when that happens, you don’t want to just throw it blindly.”\nThe sixth-year quarterback, who’s been battling through thumb soreness, said he’s fully healthy now and focused on cleaning up his mistakes heading into a matchup with one of the league’s top pass defenses.\n“I’ve been saying this for weeks — can’t turn the ball over and expect to win,” Tagovailoa said. “My ball placement has got to be supreme for our guys for run-after-catches as well.”\nDespite Miami’s offensive struggles and a mounting list of injuries that includes wide receiver Tyreek Hill and tight end Darren Waller, Tagovailoa said his motivation hasn’t wavered.\n“I get to play football,” he said. “This is a game that I’ve dreamed of playing when I was young. You’ve got to be grateful to be where your feet are and have that opportunity to go out and play football again.”\nTagovailoa said he and head coach Mike McDaniel have had “tough conversations” in recent days about fixing the offense and helping the team rebound from a 2-4 start.\n“It can’t always be, ‘Here’s your flowers,’” Tagovailoa said. “You’ve got to have those tough conversations, and we’ve had them. It’s about figuring out what we can do to get our guys going and put points on the board.”\nMiami visits Atlanta on Sunday looking to avoid a third straight loss and going 1-7 on the season.\nCopyright 2025 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.",
