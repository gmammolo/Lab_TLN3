  "text": "WVU Medicine Wheeling and Reynolds Memorial hospitals made the generous donation after the June 14 wall of water swept through parts of the county, leading to water searches and rescues.\nWHEELING, W.Va. — An underwater drone was donated to the Ohio County EMA on Wednesday, marking the first of its kind in the region.\nThe state-of-the-art, $4,000 device will be able to move through water and ravaged areas.\nThe tethered drone extends to 300 feet under water -- and can be used in all counties if need be.\nOhio County EMA Director Lou Vargo says it will be on standby in all types of underwater emergencies.\n\"Anytime we have a drowning in the creek or looking for evidence for law enforcement,\" Vargo said. \"So, if we're helping the sheriff's department or law enforcement and we're looking for evidence, and they see a gun or a knife or something like that, the drone could actually go down and grab it.\nThe device will be administered by the county's swiftwater team, making it a gamechanger in search and rescue efforts for all involved.\n\"If we see something, it's better to send the drone if we can first, so we can do it safely to make an initial situational awareness. If we do see something that we need to send a rescuer in, then the commander would make that choice.\"\nWVU Medicine Wheeling and Reynolds Memorial hospitals made the generous donation after the June 14 wall of water swept through parts of the county, leading to days of water search and rescue.\n\"With the events over the last couple of weeks, obviously emergency management and our first responders have a very important job and all of us really work together, so we want to make sure that they have all of the equipment they need to be safe and keep the community safe,\" Director of Operations at Reynolds Memorial Hospital Chris Mercer said.\nOfficials are now actively seeking locations to begin drone training in local waterways.",
