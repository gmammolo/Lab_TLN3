  "text": "LANSFORD — A third set stand wasn’t enough for Panther Valley when they dropped three of four sets at home to Northwestern Lehigh Wednesday in the District 11 3A quarterfinals.\nNorthwestern Lehigh (17-8; 14-2) advances to take on Bethlehem Catholic for the District 11 3A semifinal next Monday, October 27 at Catasauqua High School at 5:30 p.m.\n“They’re playing for their season too so it’ll be a tough match,” said Mastin. “This is as far as we’ve ever made it so our girls don’t want to lose and we got the first two sets and knew we were going to bring it our all tonight.”\nThe Tigers started out with momentum on their side and won the first set, 25-11, before Panther Valley (18-3; 12-2) made it closer in the second set for a 25-20 loss. The third set went the Panthers way with a 25-22 win before Northwestern Lehigh closed it out with a 25-18 win in the fourth set.\n“The team is writing their own story right now because this is the furthest we’ve made it in leagues and districts this year,” said Mastin.\nFollowing a third set collapse for Northwestern Lehigh, the Tigers clawed back in the fourth set when Lacy Clymer led the way with service points and the winning point at the net for the 25-18 win.\n“We have a bunch of strong servers out there so it really puts them on defense right away at the start of the match,” Mastin said. “If we serve well they’re not getting the balls they need to to set up an offense.”\nThings got rolling in the opening set when Panther Valley’s Morgan Orsulak scored at the net for the 6-4 lead. Northwestern Lehigh quickly countered and took a 10-9 lead on a Clymer service point.\nThe Tigers extended the margin on a Daisy Stringer point at the net for the 15-9 lead before Kayla Schaffer scored at the net to put Northwestern Lehigh ahead, 21-11.\nA couple of points at the net for Stringer gave Northwestern Lehigh the 25-11 win in set one.\n“We were watching a bunch of film on them trying to understand their tendencies,” said Mastin. “We’re trying to play at them and when they’re unassisted they don’t hit as well and we had to find where the balls were dropping.”\nPanther Valley got closer in the second set when JaeLynn Browdy and Orsulak each scored for the 2-1 lead before Northwestern Lehigh went on a 9-1 run which ended with a Schaffer service point for the 10-3 difference.\nThe Panthers tied the score at 16-16 following a Caroline Breslin service point. The Tigers then closed the set on a 9-4 run for the 25-20 set two win.\nThe third set belonged to the Panthers but they fell behind early, 6-2 after a Leah Nagle score at the net. The Tigers led 13-5 before Panther Valley’s Orsulak scored at the net for the 13-7 deficit.\nThe home team roared back to knot the score at 15-15 just before Breslin had a service point to take the 17-15 lead.\n“We tried to keep the tempo on our side and run our offense and that’s we really tried to do against them,” said Mastin. “If we keep them on that side of the court we’ve got some big hitters.”\nA Northwestern Lehigh hit which landed out of bounds gave Panther Valley a 23-19 lead and Northwestern Lehigh made it close before the Panthers hung on for the 25-22 win in set three.\nNorthwestern Lehigh let the Panthers stick around again in the fourth set. Nagle scored at the net to put the Tigers ahead, 10-9, and then the Tigers went on a 9-4 run for the 19-13 lead following a pair of points from Stringer.\nA Clymer point at the net closed it out for Northwestern Lehigh and the 25-18 win in set four.\n“We had them playing defense most of the night so if we keep them on that side of the court and we’re running our offense we’ve got some good hitters,” said Mastin.\nNorthwestern Lehigh now gets set for their District 11 3A semifinal matchup with Bethlehem Catholic for a spot in the district championship game.",
