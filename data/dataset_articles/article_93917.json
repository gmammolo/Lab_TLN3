  "text": "ARCHBOLD — No. 5-seeded Edgerton volleyball fell to No. 3-seeded Norwalk St. Paul 25-13, 25-14, 25-20 in a Division VII district final at Archbold High School on Wednesday.\nEdgerton (14-11) started the first set with the serve, but a kill by St. Paul’s Brooklyn Cassidy scored the first point for the Flyers. An error by St. Paul gave Edgerton the ball back, but the Flyers (18-6) soared on a 4-0 run after a serving streak by Kegney Stoll.\nIt became a series of point-for-point exchanges while Edgerton still trailed by four points and kills by St. Paul widened the gap. A double hit call on the Bulldogs led to the first timeout of the game called by Edgerton’s coach Krista Pahl at 14-6 with St. Paul leading.\nThe huddle proved helpful for the Bulldogs as they came back to the court with a kill by Elle Huard to start narrowing the gap. Aces by Edgerton’s Olivia Wallace and Aubrey Patrick brought the Bulldogs back to only four points behind at 16-12.\nA kill by Edgerton’s Alivia Farnham was the final point scored by the Bulldogs in the first set as St. Paul took advantage of Edgerton’s errors and a kill on a quick set by Cassidy to end the set 25-13.\nSt. Paul started the set 2-0, but a kill by Kaitlyn Burke ended their streak. The Flyers tried to come back with a kill, but a missed set from them and an out-of-bounds block gave Edgerton the lead at 3-2.\nThe Bulldogs utilized this opportunity to bring themselves to a three-point lead, their largest of the game thanks to two tips and a free ball sent over the net by Farnham.\nSt. Paul came back from behind to take a 10-9 lead with a kill by Cassidy, an ace by Lily Cuturic, and two out-of-bounds errors by Edgerton where Pahl then used another timeout.\nOnce again the Bulldogs came back from the timeout strong with a kill through a block by Ava Giesige and a hit into the net by St. Paul, but they were unable to hold the Flyers.\nA lack of communication led to a dropped ball on Edgerton’s court, and kills by St. Paul’s Annie Friend, Ella Kalizewski, and a deep push to the corner gave the flyers the second set at 25-14.\nEdgerton had their strongest set in the third, never trailing until a St. Paul kill gave the Flyers a 12-11 lead.\nThe set continued with a series of point-for-point exchanges with neither team ever allowing more than a four-point gap until the set ended at 25-20.\nTwo kills by the Flyers and an out-of-bounds block by Edgerton held the Bulldogs at 20 while St. Paul scored the remaining five points — including a kill from Cassidy to seal the win —to take the third set and the match.\n“We are just looking forward to going to regionals again and seeing what we can do, how far we can go,” said St. Paul’s Coach Angie Kalizewski as the Flyers reached regionals for the second straight year. “We take every step one step at a time because we think that’s the most important thing.”\nThe Bulldogs were led by Farnham with 15 kills on 30-of-33 attacking while Ava Swank recorded a team-best 16 assists on 64-of-64 setting.\nHuard (three kills) and Burke (two kills) also contributed for Edgerton.\nWith the loss, Edgerton seniors Swank, Farnham, Giesige, Wallace and Patrick have played their final match in an Edgerton volleyball uniform.\n“Coming into the tournament, people didn’t expect us to play as well as we did,” Pahl said. “That’s why I told the girls, ‘You accomplished something, and be proud of it.’”\nSt. Paul will take on the winner of No. 2 Pandora-Gilboa/No. 2 Miller City on Oct. 30th at Elida Fieldhouse. The match is slated to start at 6 p.m.",
