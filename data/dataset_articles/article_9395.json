  "text": "Living\n31 Workers Rescued After Los Angeles Tunnel Collapse\nMore than two dozen workers have been safely rescued after a tunnel collapsed in Los Angeles, according to The Independent.\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) reported that a total of 31 workers were rescued in the late hours of July 9 after an industrial tunnel collapsed in the city of Wilmington. \"Thirty-one persons, all believed to be tunnel workers, have been safely removed from the tunnel alive without visible injury,\" the update read. \"None are missing.\"\nThe collapse occurred at a \"horizontal excavation site\" located underground and \"about five to six miles south of the sole entry/rescue access portal.\" The tunnel, intended \"for municipal wastewater management,\" was in the process of being built when the catastrophe occurred. The initial collapse reportedly separated the workers into two factions, with one group of four having to climb over piles of loose soil, which were between 12 and 15 feet high, in order to reach the other 27 victims.\nThe successful operation required more than 100 LAFD workers on the scene, including some with special experience in rescuing people from confined spaces. Footage captured by ABC7 shows the workers being lifted out of the tunnel.\n\"LAFD has just reported that all workers who were trapped in the tunnel in Wilmington are now out and accounted for,\" L.A. Mayor Karen Brass wrote on X. \"I just spoke with many of the workers who were trapped. Thank you to all of our brave first responders who acted immediately. You are L.A.'s true heroes.\"\nRelated: Why Glen Powell's 'Running Man' Role 'Worries' His Mom\n31 Workers Rescued After Los Angeles Tunnel Collapse first appeared on Men's Journal on Jul 10, 2025\n2025 The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.
