  "text": "By Reign Amurao ,\n1 hours ago Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid played for the first time since he was shut down by the franchise in February. Fans are looking forward to a better campaign for Embiid, especially after his performance last season. The big man was limited to just 19 games due to his nagging knee issues. He did not finish the entire season and was shut down to undergo arthroscopic surgery on his left knee.\nOn Wednesday, he made his first NBA appearance. Although he played in some of the 76ers’ preseason games, the team’s bout against the Boston Celtics made Embiid’s appearance official.\nThe Sixers have a high ceiling this year after missing the 2025 playoffs. Against an old rival, Embiid underperformed in his first regular-season game. He finished with four points in just 20 minutes of action. Understandably, he’d need time to get adjusted to the pace of the NBA after months of not being part of the action. But his outing was disappointing, as he shot 11.1% on the floor.\nOct 17, 2025; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid before action against the Minnesota Timberwolves at Xfinity Mobile Arena. Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-Imagn Images After the team’s season opener against the Celtics, fans expressed their disappointment with Joel Embiid’s performance.\n“He should retire. Mfer doesn’t like playing but loves his paycheck,” a fan said .\n“Ain’t trusting that process anymore,” another fan commented .\n“Joel embiid looking ready for a podcast ” a fan pointed out.\n“Look like he can barely walk , more holes in tights then points,” someone commented .\n“He may be done. Like his days of making all star teams and all nba teams are over,” a comment read .\n“Time to hang it up and get a 9-5 big guy,” a fan commented.\nFortunately for the 76ers, they managed to have a 117-116 victory over the Celtics. All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey had 40 points and No. 3 pick of the 2025 draft, V.J. Edgecombe, helped the team with 34 points.",
