  "text": "It’s not just in Montreal that the number-one goaltender is struggling: earlier today, Jacob Fowler allowed six goals in 24 shots to the Belleville Senators. After blanking his opponents, the goaltender had another difficult outing. In three games this season, Fowler has a 3.34 goals-against average and a 0.884 save percentage. This is far from impressive, and not unlike Samuel Montembault’s situation with the Habs. Fortunately, as in Montreal, the Rocket have a good second goaltender in Kaapo Kähkönen, who can keep goal while Fowler finds his form. While the situation is not yet worrisome for Fowler and Montembault, the presence of a good number two takes some pressure off them at the moment.\nIn two games, Kähkönen has two wins, a 2.01 save average and a 0.915 save percentage, all much more interesting numbers. Hence the importance of having quality second goaltenders, and as we saw in last year’s playoffs, the 29-year-old can get the job done if necessary.\nAnd let’s not forget that the Rocket had a tough game on defense, with the team’s blue line decimated.\nNot a great defensive performance from Jacob Fowler tonight in Belleville.\nThe lack of resources on defense was evident tonight.\nThe Davidson-Beck-Mesar line finished the night at -3.\nBelleville’s 1st win of the season.\n[https://t.co/zdGtP0QKll-]Vincent Demuy (@VDemuy)\n[October 23, 2025]\nIn addition to the injuries to David Reinbacher and Josiah Didier, the Habs have recalled Marc Del Gaizo. That’s a lot of absentees, and today it showed in the Rocket game. It’s not an ideal scenario for a young, developing goaltender. And in these conditions, even Kähkönen may have trouble getting the job done. On a more positive note, however, Adam Engström scored his first goal of the season.\nENGY\nLAV 2 – 3 BEL\n[pic.twitter.com/zp2ssxY25S-]Rocket de Laval (@RocketLaval)\n[October 23, 2025]\nIn short, we’re hoping for a quick resolution to the goaltending situation in both Laval and Montreal.\nThe playoff teams are locked but there is still a lot to be determined in the final week of the regular season.\n[@DuaneFordeTSN]on who’s better between the Ticats & Alouettes in the East, and which team in the West is the biggest threat:[https://t.co/PhLu7uVtXd][pic.twitter.com/zCpYjQqKEJ-]CFL on TSN (@CFLonTSN)\n[October 22, 2025]\n– Excellent analysis!\nThe\n[#BlueJays]and[#Dodgers]find themselves in the World Series.[@SebasBerrouard]and I set the table by analyzing what lies ahead on the[@passion_mlb]podcast https://t.co[/zOcXtZvkWL-]Charles-Alexis Brisebois (@Charles__Alexis)\n[October 23, 2025]\n– We’re getting ready for Toronto!\nFresh paint from our grounds crew (plus Myles Straw and Joey Loperfido)\nTwo sleeps away\n[#WANTITALL][pic.twitter.com/dNd3Xgnlcy-]Toronto Blue Jays (@BlueJays)\n[October 23, 2025]\n– He wins his first game.\nColten Ellis gets the W in his NHL debut with his family looking on in the stands\n[pic.twitter.com/BCohDFVz8c-]Gino Hard (@GinoHard_)\n[October 23, 2025]\n– Raptors win their first game\nGAME WON\n[pic.twitter.com/555KMfHbjI-]Toronto Raptors (@Raptors)\n[October 23, 2025]\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
