  "text": "The Phoenix Suns dumped Bradley Beal after they were atrocious with him on the floor last season, and his first game with the Clippers was the same story. Beal was happy to leave the Valley. The Suns failed to win a playoff game in his two seasons. He went to LA to contend for a championship, but Beal is not that player anymore.\nThe rebuilding Jazz shockingly blew out the Clippers. Beal started, but was limited to 20 minutes on the floor. He had five points, one rebound, one steal, and one turnover. The former All-Star went two of five from the field, including making a 3-pointer, as the Clippers were outscored by nine in his run.\nIt was just like his days in Phoenix. Beal wanted to start and play a significant role, but the Clippers were outscored handily with him on the floor. Suns fans know the story all too well.\nBradley Beal’s Clippers opener went exactly how Suns fans expected\nNobody thought LA would lose to Utah, but Lauri Markkanen and the Jazz had other ideas. They used a 43-19 first quarter to race out to a lead the Clippers could just never overcome. Los Angeles won the second half by ten, but still lost the contest 129-108.\nThe Suns were a negative-7.7 points per 100 possessions last season with Beal on the floor. They were a positive-1.0 when he went to the bench. The Suns went virtually all-in to trade for the 6’4 guard, but could never figure things out with him. It was a disappointing era that crushed the franchise’s future.\nThe Suns waived-and-stretched Beal to get him off their roster this summer. They have $19.3 million per year on their books through 2030. Phoenix was willing to take that hit to dodge the luxury tax and send the four-time All-Star packing. Things were that bad.\nMuch was made about the Clippers' offseason and how they are primed to contend. Head coach Tyronn Lue sees Beal as a starter and lockdown defender, but he is wrong. Suns fans know his defense is problematic. His best role is a bucket-getter off the bench at this stage of his career. LA will quickly come to that realization and make the change.\nPhoenix Suns fans were not surprised to see night one with Bradley Beal playing a significant role blow up on the Clippers. It will be the first of many for LA. The four-time All-Star is no longer the prime version. Suns fans know, but the Clippers are still finding out.",
