  "text": "Virat Kohli’s Australian farewell tour is turning into a nightmare after the Indian superstar fell for a second straight duck early in the visitors’ innings in Adelaide.\nComing to the crease in the seventh over following the fall of captain Shubman Gill, he could survive only three balls before being trapped plumb in front by Aussie quick Xavier Bartlett, who completed a double-wicket maiden.\nKohli had a lengthy chat with Rohit Sharma but wisely chose not to review with ball tracking, confirming the ball would have hit the top of middle and leg.\nSign up to The Nightly's newsletters.\nGet the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox.\nBy continuing you agree to ourTermsand\nPrivacy Policy.\nIt comes after he also failed to score in Perth after he was caught at point by Cooper Connolly off Mitchell Starc for an eight-ball duck, marking the first time in his One Day career he has made back-to-back ducks.\nThe 36-year-old, who has already retired from Test and Twenty20 international cricket, gave a brief wave to the crowd as he walked off in what is likely his penultimate innings on Australian shores.\n“Is that just a bit of a sign that this is the last time we will see him in Australia?” Mike Hussey said on commentary.\nBartlett had plenty of praise for Kohli, admitting it took a bit of luck to get him early.\n“Probably one of the best white-ball players of all time,” he said during a drinks break.\n“Lucky to get him, I tried to bowl an outswinger and it nipped back. Probably a bit of pure luck, but nice to see the back of him early.”\nBeyond the disappointment for the large contingent of Indian fans, it also puts Kohli’s future in the Indian One Day team in jeopardy as he fights for his place to remain in the conversation for their 2027 World Cup squad, having been told he was no certainty to be selected.\nHis wicket left India crawling at 2-29 off 10 overs after Australian captain Mitch Marsh elected to bowl first after winning the toss.",
