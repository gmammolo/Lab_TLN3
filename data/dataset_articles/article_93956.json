  "text": "Globe becomes second high profile runner scratched from Cox Plate following vet assessment\nVets have scratched last-start winner Globe from Saturday’s $6 million Cox Plate at Moonee Valley after he failed a fitness and health examination on Thursday morning.\nRacing Victoria officials said the Mick Price and Michael Kent Jr-trained $1.2 million earner, who has won six races, was found to have leg soreness and a heart issue.\n“Globe was lame in the off foreleg when vets watched him trot this morning,” Price said. “They also did a heart test and detected he had cardiac arrythmia.\nSign up to The Nightly's newsletters.\nGet the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox.\nBy continuing you agree to ourTermsand\nPrivacy Policy.\n“We were aware he had a soundness problem last week, but his leg trouble seemed to have cleared. I was not aware of the cardiac arrythmia issue until this morning’s examination.”\nThe Group 1 Might And Power Stakes (2000m) was won on October 11 by Globe, who would have almost certainly led and set a solid pace in Saturday’s weight-for-age championship.\nGlobe is the second high profile scratching by Victorian vets, who last week withdrew Cox Plate and Melbourne Cup favourite Sir Delius from the spring carnival.\nThey said the Gai Waterhouse and Adrian Bott-trained Sir Delius’ leg scans revealed he had a “heightened risk of injury.”\nOfficials have introduced stringent vet tests on carnival entrants after a horror run of Melbourne Cup fatalities which resulted from horses going amiss in running.\nPrice said later he agreed with vets’ decision to scratch Globe.\n“It’s disappointing,” Price said. “But he clearly has problems and it would have been 50 times worse if he’d run last in the Cox Plate, and aggravated troubles. He will be spelled, with a view to racing in autumn.”",
