  "text": "Disappointment was in store for Virat Kohli and Indian fans after the batting superstar failed to open his account for a second straight time in the ongoing three-match ODI series against Australia. Kohli missed a flick and was trapped LBW by Xavier Bartlett for a four-ball duck at the Adelaide Oval. This is the first time that Kohli, in his glorious ODI career, has recorded back-to-back ducks. The Australia bilateral series is his first such international appearance since the Champions Trophy earlier this year where he played a key role in India’s unbeaten march to title triumph. Kohli has been quite successful at the Adelaide Oval, across formats, and his favourite hunting ground. His love affair with the venue is the reason why he received a roaring reception after walking out to bat on Thursday and then was given a standing ovation despite the duck given it’s likely the final time that he is playing a contest at the venue. And the batting superstar acknowledged the ovation by raising his right hand. However, his gesture has fans worried on social media that the end of his ODI career is nearing. Kohli has already retired from Tests and T20Is but remains available for ODIs. With the next ODI World Cup two years away, it’s not a guarantee that the former skipper, despite his excellent record, will be part of Team India’s plans.",
