  "text": "Featured Video\nUnreal Raptors Game-Winner 🤯\nClippers' Tyronn Lue Says 'I Take Responsibility for That Bulls--t' After Blowout Loss\nLos Angeles Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue was blunt when taking accountability for the team's season-opening 129-108 loss to the Utah Jazz on Wednesday.\n\"I take responsibility for that bulls--t,\" Lue said while walking out of his press conference after the game, per Clippers reporter Justin Russo.\nLos Angeles never held a lead at any point in the contest, trailing by as many as 37 points during the lopsided defeat.\nIt was a surprising result considering the Clippers are entering the year with postseason aspirations once again after compiling a 50-32 record during their 2024-25 campaign.\nMeanwhile, Utah's 17-65 record last season marked the team's worst finish in franchise history.\nThe Jazz opened Wednesday's game with a 19-9 edge and didn't slow down, eventually leading 43-19 at the end of the first quarter.\nLos Angeles was never able to cut the deficit to single digits for the remainder of the contest. The Clippers finished the game with 108 points, while the Jazz scored 108 points through three quarters.\nKawhi Leonard and Bradley Beal both struggled for Los Angeles, as they combined to finish with a mere 15 points on 5-of-14 shooting.\nJames Harden racked up 15 points and 11 assists, but shot just 2-of-9 from three-point territory.\nUtah won with a balanced scoring effort, as three different players recorded at least 20 points. The Jazz were led by center Walker Kessler, who finished with 22 points and nine rebounds while racking up four blocks without missing a shot.\nLos Angeles owned the league's No. 3 defensive rating last season, but couldn't slow down Utah's offense throughout the game (via NBA.com). The Jazz shot 55.2 percent from the field as a team.\nLue's squad will be looking to quickly bounce back in a Friday matchup with the Phoenix Suns. Tip-off is at 10:30 p.m. ET.",
