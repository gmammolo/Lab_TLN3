  "text": "The Seattle Mariners were nine outs away from a first pennant when the season turned on one choice. In the bottom of the seventh, with a 3–1 lead and traffic on the bases, Seattle manager Dan Wilson went to Eduard Bazardo—his trusted pivot reliever—over Andres Munoz.\nGeorge Springer met him and flipped the American League Championship Series in one swing. Toronto 4, Seattle 3.\nThe Mariners have gone 49 seasons without a trip to the World Series. That decision extended the wait.\nGeorge Kirby handed the game to Bryan Woo with a two-run cushion. The inning opened with a walk and a single. A sacrifice bunt moved both runners. Wilson made the move he has leaned on all year and the one he had made the night before, even with the Mariners out of the game early.\nBazardo came out in a tight spot. Springer jumped the sinker and sent the Toronto Blue Jays to the World Series.\nWilson’s explanation stayed consistent with how he has run this bullpen:\n“Bazardo has been the guy that's gotten us through those situations, those tight ones, especially in the pivot role, and that's where we were at that point.”\nPressed on Munoz’s usage—rested, dominant this postseason—and the fact he did not appear until after Seattle trailed, Wilson didn’t duck it:\n“Yeah, I mean, you make your decisions, and sometimes you have to live and die with it. I think, again, the way Bazardo has thrown the ball all season long, we were comfortable with where we were and it just, again, didn't go our way.”\nThat is the manager’s calculus: ride the identity you built for six months, even when October begs you to break the pattern.\nBut, it will haunt him all winter and maybe beyond.\nAndres Munoz was waiting in the bullpen.\nHe’s the highest-leverage arm on the roster, and Game 7 facing the top of the Blue Jays lineup was the spot with the most pressure.\nWith two on, one out, and the heart of the order due, the cleanest argument is simple: send your best to face their best before the game flips.\nIf you burn Munoz in the seventh, you sort out the eighth with what’s left. Seattle chose the lane discipline that worked all year. It cost them the one at-bat they could not lose.\nThere are fair counters.\nMunoz had three outs waiting later. Bazardo had banked trust, handled this bridge for months, and pitched well in this series. Kirby and Woo had done their part. You can understand the decision and still recognize the reality: October often rewards the team most willing to go to the hammer one hitter early.\nBut even as the champagne was still spraying in the Blue Jays clubhouse, Wilson’s move was being second-guessed.\n\"How do you lose this game without Andrés Muñoz getting those six outs?” former big league catcher and current host of the Foul Territory podcast Erik Kratz asked.\nIronically, hours before the game on that podcast former New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies manager Joe Girardi had warned that in a playoff series, the relievers can be over-exposed and analytics do not account for that.\nSecond-guessing is the price of being a big league manager. It gets louder the further you go in October. .\nWilson had reasons, history, and the clubhouse behind the plan.\nStill, Springer had history too. It was his 23rd playoff home run, the ninth that gave his team the lead.\nThe winter’s conversation won’t stop at one choice. They could have walked Springer.\nIt wasn’t just one moment either.\nSeattle also has to clean up run prevention and shorten games with one more miss-heavy lefty—but that seventh-inning call will echo. If you are nine outs away next October, the question won’t be hypothetical anymore.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams. Emailed daily.
