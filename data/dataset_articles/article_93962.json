  "text": "Featured Video\nDoes KD NEED a Ring in Houston? 💍\nPhiladelphia 76ers Can't Ignore Their Growing Joel Embiid Problem\nCan a season-opening win be both buoying and deflating? I'm asking for the Philadelphia 76ers.\nTheir 117-116 victory over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday revealed a whole bunch of good and intriguing developments, beginning with VJ Edgecombe going kaboom. It also left them, and me, and you, and everyone everywhere, wondering just what the heck is going on with Joel Embiid.\nThe 31-year-old looked like a shell of himself through a little over 20 minutes of action. Social media was ablaze with video receipts, and more critically, questions about his left knee, his future and Philly's overall outlook as a result.\nAny concerns and observations must be couched with the \"It's only one game\" caveat. Yet when that one game aligns with longstanding unease, we'd be remiss if we didn't acknowledge the Sixers should already be on tilt.\nJoel Embiid Just Had One Of His Worst Games Ever\n1 of 5Joel Embiid finished Wednesday night with four points on 1-of-9 shooting from the floor. This marks the second-lowest scoring total for his career during a game in which he logged at least 20 minutes.\nOh, and his 16.8 true shooting percentage (you're reading that correctly) is also the third worst of his career—number of minutes played be damned.\nMore alarmingly, the Sixers lost Embiid's court time by a total of 16 points. Sure, he has turned in worse plus-minus performances over the course of his career. But this is the first time Philly was minus-16 or worse with him in the game when he played under 21 minutes\nEmbiid Struggled Just as Much on Tape as on Paper\n2 of 5Invoking the good ol' eye test as a potential foil for box-score dorks accomplishes…absolutely nothing.\nJoel Embiid's performance versus the Celtics looked as bad on tape as it does on paper. It seemed as if he could barely jump. There was hardly any movement from him, on or off the ball.\nNever mind getting a single attempt at the rim. All nine of his shots came outside of the paint.\nBoston effectively didn't care who it put on him, because he couldn't capitalize:\nSticking smaller players on Embiid used to be considered taboo. Even if he was outside the paint, he could muster the pizzazz to create space on the perimeter or power his way to the basket.\nThat part of his arsenal was nowhere to be found against the Celtics.\nNick Nurse Did NOT Have Joel Embiid on the Floor in Crunch Time\n3 of 5Sixers head coach Nick Nurse went with Dominick Barlow over Joel Embiid down the stretch.\nRaise your hand if you expected to see that happen this season. Or ever.\nEmbiid is working his way back from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee over the summer. That is a factor in his overall minutes. Still, you'd expect the player who's supposed to be the franchise cornerstone to be on the floor when you're trying to collect a victory.\nThe sight of not seeing Embiid in crunch time was jarring. Even more unsettling, though, is knowing that keeping him on the bench was clearly the right decision.\nTyrese Maxey and VJ Edgecombe will Have to Carry Philly...\n4 of 5As Embiid attempts to work himself into form and Paul George recovers from a knee injury, the Sixers won't just need more out of Tyrese Maxey. They'll need another marquee contributor to emerge from the ranks.\nSo, VJ Edgecombe.\nExpecting rookies to serve as viable co-stars out of the gate is a tall order no matter where they're drafted. If Game No. 1 is any indication, Edgecombe is up to the task.\nThe 20-year-old dropped 30 points, the third-most ever in an NBA debut. His default mode appears to be fearlessness. He has no qualms about firing off threes (5-of-13 versus Boston) or attacking in transition. His cuts to the basket are posters waiting to happen.\nEqually impressive, Edgecombe knew when to pull back on the throttle, like when Maxey ripped off 19 second-quarter points. That balance worked both ways. Maxey was content to move into the backdrop when Edgecombe fried the Celtics defense for 10 straight points.\nThese two aren't just Philly's future. For the time being, they're the Sixers' present, too.\n...but the Sixers Eventually Need Embiid to Reach a Sustainable Peak\n5 of 5One game is not enough to altogether write off Joel Embiid's star power. He has always needed time to re-acclimate himself when returning from injuries and surgeries. This may be no different.\nLet's also not forget that he looked pretty good in his lone preseason appearance against the Minnesota Timberwolves. This is not someone who's consigned to operating at a perma-nadir.\nCompletely ignoring what we just watched would nevertheless be foolish.\nPretty much everyone has collectively decided Embiid will never appear in enough games to contend for MVP awards ever again. This performance hints at the possibility he never even plays at that level again.\nShrug it off if you must. Maybe that proves to be the smart play. But when his number of appearances are going to be inherently limited, every one of them counts. He will not always have a ton of runway to work himself into form. The days of him playing in longer bursts during individual games could be over, too.\nPhilly better hope that it isn't, or that Embiid figures out how to thrive amid shifting court time and usage. For as much as Tyrese Maxey and VJ Edgecombe can carry the Sixers toward high-octane Nirvana, the team will eventually need a more deliberate and overpowering force, not to mention a defensive anchor.\nEmbiid is supposed to be that guy. For so long, he has been. Whether he still can be, even in dribs and drabs, is officially up for debate.\nDan Favale is a National NBA Writer for Bleacher Report.
