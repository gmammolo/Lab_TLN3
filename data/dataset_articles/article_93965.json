(Source: X) Team India were off to a shocking start in the second ODI of the three-match series against Australia at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday, losing two wickets in the 7th over of the innings to Xavier Bartlett. The second of those wickets left everyone in Adelaide stunned as former India skipper Virat Kohli walked back after his second successive duck in the three-match ODI series.\nKohli, who is returning to international cricket after March, was dismissed for a fourth-ball duck while playing across a straight delivery from Bartlett. The Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) batter had been dismissed for an eight-ball duck by Mitchell Starc at Perth in the first ODI on Sunday.\nIt was Bartlett’s second wicket in the over after dismissing Indian skipper Shubman Gill for 9. Gill tried to be proactive and stepped out to the Australian pacer but only managed to sky the ball to Aussie captain Mitchell March at mid-off.\nWatch Virat Kohli is being dismissed for a duck by Xavier Bartlett HERE… VIRAT KOHLI GONE FOR HIS SECOND DUCK OF THE SERIES! #AUSvIND | #PlayoftheDay | @BKTtires pic.twitter.com/jqIdvMeX9T\n— cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) October 23, 2025\nAdd India.com as a Preferred Source A heartbroken Kohli discussed for about 15 seconds if he should sent the leg-before decision up to the third umpire but decided against it after a discussion with Rohit Sharma. Kohli acknowledged the cheers from the crowd at Adelaide after possibly walking back for the final time from his favourite international venue.\nIt was Kohli’s 40th duck in international cricket and he is only behind former India pacer Zaheer Khan with most ducks among Indian cricketers. Zaheer had 43 ducks in international cricket.\nKohli equalled the record of his former Delhi teammate and pacer Ishant Sharma with 40 ducks in international cricket while Harbhajan Singh and Jasprit Bumrah have 37 and 35 respectively. The former India captain had a phenomenal record at the Adelaide Oval across formats with 975 runs with five hundreds at this Australian ground.\n(More to come)\n/ authors starts / .author-profile-row{margin:15px 0 30px;width:100%; display: block; position: relative;} .author-profile-row a.linkBox{background: #F3F3F3;border: 1px solid #F26822;border-radius: 10px;padding:15px;width:100%; display: block;} .author-profile-row h2{font-size:16px; color:#F26822; font-weight:700; padding:0 0 15px; margin: 0;} .author-profile-row .repeat-box a{width:100%; display: block;} .author-profile-row .repeat-box figure{gap:10px; width:100%;} .author-profile-row .repeat-box .photo{width: auto; flex:0 0 53px} .author-profile-row .repeat-box .photo .lazy-image{ padding-top:53px; border-radius:500px;} .author-profile-row .repeat-box .photo .lazy-image img{border-radius:500px;object-fit:cover;} .author-profile-row .repeat-box .text{flex:1;width: auto;padding: 0;} .author-profile-row .repeat-box .text h3{font-size:16px; font-weight:700; color:var(--black);} .author-profile-row .repeat-box .text p{font-size:14px; line-height:1.7; color:var(--black); margin-top:8px;} .author-profile-row a.linkBox:hover{border-color:#0784d3;} .author-profile-row ul.social-icon{position: absolute; right:15px; top:15px; margin: 0!important; padding:0; gap:0 5px; z-index:5;} .author-profile-row ul.social-icon li{width:25px;height:25px; border-radius:100px;} .author-profile-row ul.social-icon li a, .author-profile-row ul.social-icon li img{display:inline-block;width:25px;height:25px} /**",
