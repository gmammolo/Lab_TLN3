  "text": "The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Multan Sultans owner Ali Tareen have long had a strained relationship, and tensions appear to be escalating following the PCB’s latest move, a formal notice that casts doubt over the franchise’s future in the Pakistan Super League (PSL).\nAccording to veteran sports journalist Saleem Khaliq, the PCB has served Multan Sultans with a notice citing alleged violations of their franchise agreement. The board has warned that unresolved disputes could result in the termination of one of the league’s most successful teams.\nReports suggest the notice highlights repeated delays in finalizing financial settlements and renewing contractual obligations with the current ownership group. Despite multiple reminders to Multan Sultans, the PCB claims that key terms of the 10-year PSL franchise agreement remain unmet.\nThe board has now issued a deadline for the owners to respond, cautioning that failure to resolve the matter could trigger a re-bidding process for the Multan franchise ahead of the 2026 PSL season. With two new teams already expected to join, PSL 11 could feature three franchises under new ownership.\nMultan Sultans, who joined the league in 2017, have had a turbulent financial history. Their original owners, Schon Properties, had their contract terminated due to payment defaults. In 2018, Alamgir Khan Tareen and Ali Tareen acquired the franchise rights for a record Rs 5.2 billion, including an annual fee of Rs 1.1 billion, the highest in PSL history.\nSince assuming sole ownership, Ali Tareen has frequently criticized the PCB’s financial model, arguing that it unfairly disadvantages Multan Sultans. His concerns have become a recurring point of contention between the two parties.\nThe latest developments have sparked widespread debate in Pakistan’s cricketing circles, with many observers noting that Multan Sultans, a consistent title contender and former PSL champion, may be on the verge of a major ownership shake-up.\nStill, fans of the franchise need not panic just yet. Ali Tareen has already indicated that he does not intend to renew the current PSL deal under the existing terms. With the PCB now conducting a league-wide valuation of all teams, the Multan ownership group is expected to rebid for the rights under a revised framework that could offer more friendly terms.\nAs the PSL continues to evolve, the fate of Multan Sultans could become a defining moment in the league’s journey going forwards. Whether Ali Tareen remains at the helm or a new chapter begins, one thing is clear, the passion of Multan’s fans and the franchise’s competitive spirit will remain central to the PSL’s future.",
