  "text": "Virat Kohli’s struggles in the ongoing Australia vs India ODI series continued on Thursday as the star Indian batter was dismissed for his second consecutive duck during the second match at Adelaide Oval.\nXavier Bartlett dismisses Virat Kohli early\nFacing just four deliveries, Kohli fell to Australian pacer Xavier Bartlett, whose sharp new-ball spell rattled India’s top order in the early overs.\nComing in after Shubman Gill’s early dismissal, Kohli appeared composed initially, leaving and defending the first three balls. However, Bartlett produced a brilliant inswinging delivery that nipped back and hit his pads, taking Kohli by suprise. The Indian talisman walked back in disbelief, choosing not to review the on-field decision.\nThis marked Kohli’s second straight zero in the series, following his first-ball duck against Mitchell Starc in Perth – the first time in his ODI career he has recorded back-to-back ducks in a bilateral series.\nHere’s the video:\nVIRAT KOHLI GONE FOR HIS SECOND DUCK OF THE SERIES!\n[#AUSvIND]|[#PlayoftheDay]|[@BKTtires][pic.twitter.com/jqIdvMeX9T]— cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau)\n[October 23, 2025]\nAdelaide Oval: From Kohli’s fortress to his latest heartbreak\nThe dismissal was particularly poignant given Kohli’s deep connection with Adelaide Oval, a venue he has often referred to as his “second home ground.” Over the years, he has delivered some of his most memorable innings here, including centuries in both Tests and ODIs.\nDespite the latest disappointment, Kohli’s record at the venue remains unmatched: 976 runs, the most by any visiting batter at the iconic ground.\nKohli’s rare statistical low amid glorious ODI career\nKohli’s consecutive ducks underline a rare slump in an otherwise stellar ODI career, where he averages nearly 58 runs per innings with 79 international centuries across formats.\nThe back-to-back dismissals will be seen as an anomaly for the 36-year-old, who has historically bounced back strongly after lean patches – particularly on Australian soil.\nBartlett continues dream run in Australia’s bowling attack\nThe 25-year-old Bartlett, who impressed in the BBL and recent series against West Indies, has quickly become a revelation in Australia’s pace unit. His control and ability to generate movement both ways have troubled even the most seasoned batters.\nBartlett’s dismissal of Kohli capped off a dominant new-ball spell that left India struggling early, showcasing why he’s being touted as Australia’s next big pace prospect.\nAlso READ: AUS vs IND, 2nd ODI Match Prediction – Who will win today’s game between Australia and India?\nAustralia vs IND 2nd ODI: Playing XI of both teams\nAustralia (Playing XI): Mitchell Marsh (c), Travis Head, Matthew Short, Matt Renshaw, Alex Carey (wk), Cooper Connolly, Mitchell Owen, Xavier Bartlett, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood\nIndia (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill (c), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (wk), Washington Sundar, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammed Siraj",
