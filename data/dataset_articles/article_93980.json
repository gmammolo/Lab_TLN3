  "text": "Indonesia has denied visas to Israeli athletes for a world championship event in Jakarta, citing its constitution and public order. The decision has prompted the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to discourage holding events in Indonesia and halt discussions about a future Olympic bid. Indonesia has taken a decisive stance by denying visas to Israeli athletes, preventing them from participating in a world championship event in Jakarta. According to the country's sports minister, this decision aligns with Indonesia's constitutional principles, primarily aimed at maintaining public order. The move has significant diplomatic repercussions, particularly with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stepping in. The IOC has urged international sporting federations to avoid hosting events in Indonesia following the exclusion of Israeli participants. Furthermore, all talks concerning Indonesia's potential bid for the 2036 Summer Olympic Games have been placed on hold. The world's largest Muslim-majority nation remains steadfast in its foreign policy, which includes not recognizing Israel until there is acknowledgment of Palestine's independence. Sports Minister Erick Thohir emphasizes Indonesia's continued commitment to participating in regional and international sporting events despite the restrictions imposed by its policies. Despite potential limitations on hosting major global sports events, Indonesia remains dedicated to upholding its diplomatic principles while also pushing forward its sports agenda on other fronts.",
