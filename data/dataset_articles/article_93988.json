  "text": "When Shubman Gill incorrectly called ‘tails’ at the start of the second ODI against Australia at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday afternoon, it extended one of international cricket’s most extraordinary losing streaks.\nIncredibly, India has now lost 17 consecutive ODI tosses—yes you read that right, 17.\nIt’s a losing run that began almost two years ago in the final of the 2023 ICC World Cup in Ahmedabad, where Australia defeated India by six wickets.\nWhen it ends is anyone’s guess, it seems.\nMORE: 'Can he play a cover drive?': Allan Border questions potential opener\nWhile every coin toss is an independent event with a 50-50 chance of landing heads or tails, the mathematical probability of losing 17 times in a row is a minuscule one in 131,072.\nPut another way, that’s 0.0000763%.\nBack in March this year, former Indian skipper Rohit Sharma equaled Brian Lara for the most consecutive coin tosses lost by any ODI captain when his personal mark hit 12.\nShubman Gill assumed the Indian ODI captaincy for the current series against Australia and has fared no better, currently sitting at 0-2.\nGill will get another chance to end the streak at the SCG on Saturday in the final outing of the three-game ODI series.",
