  "text": "Girls soccer\nAbq. La Cueva 5, Santa Fe High 0\nWhat happened: The visiting Bears scored four times against the Demons in the first half during Wednesday’s District 2-5A match at Santa Fe High. In the second half, the Demons allowed just one goal and played better offensively. Santa Fe High head coach Justin Najaka said the offense improved with a few tweaks. “We created a number of scoring opportunities by switching the point of attack and balancing our attacks in all three channels,” Najaka said.",
