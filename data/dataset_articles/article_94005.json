  "text": "Sport\nUCL: ‘You don’t do that’ – Cole, Gudjohnsen slam Tosin Adarabioyo over penalty in Chelsea’s 5-1 win\nFormer Chelsea attackers, Joe Cole and Eidur Gudjohnsen have criticised the club defender, Tosin Adarabioyo for his ‘clumsy’ error in the Blues’ 5-1 Champions League win over 10-man Ajax on Wednesday.\nThe defender gave away a penalty that resulted in Ajax’s only goal in the game after he brought down Raul Moro inside the box.\nFormer Manchester United man, Wout Weghorst, scored for Ajax from the resulting spot-kick.\nChelsea boss, Enzo Maresca removed the defender at half-time, replacing him with Trevoh Chalobah at the break.\nFormer Chelsea stars, Cole and Eidur Gudjohnsen who were on punditry duties for TNT Sports, were critical of Adarabioyo’s mistake.\n“It was clumsy,” Cole said. “In modern football, you cannot dangle a leg. He dangles his leg\n“Any of these players now, they feel a little bit contact, they go down. The goalkeeper needs to do better there [too] because Weghorst doesn’t put it into the bottom corner.”\nGudjohnsen added, “When you’re a man up, you don’t want to concede and you don’t want to nibble at a striker running at you.\n“You just want to stand your ground and stay on your feet. It was a silly challenge, really.”",
