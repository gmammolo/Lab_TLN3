  "text": "LeBron Jameswill miss the Lakers’ season opener and several weeks due to sciatica.- Coach JJ Redick urges all players to “star in their roles” during James’ absence.\n- Lakers must use a team approach until James returns, possibly mid-November.\nJJ Redick and the Los Angeles Lakers will be without LeBron James for Tuesday’s season-opener against the Golden State Warriors. The stage is set for the highly anticipated matchup, but the fact that James, who is expected to be out until at least mid-November due to sciatica, will not take the court will be an anticlimactic aspect to the spectacle.\nAs for the basketball, Redick expects his players to step up amid the absence of the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, not only on Tuesday night against Steph Curry and Co. but also for the first part of the new NBA season.\nJames reportedly started having nerve issues in late July or early August during on-court workouts. The 40-year-old’s injury involves pain in the lower back/glute region, which is brought about by irritation of the sciatic nerve on his right side. James was forced to sit out training camp because of the injury and was not able to take part in the team’s preseason. He is expected to miss the first three to four weeks of the season.\nRedick spoke to reporters before Tuesday’s showdown, and the second-year coach had a message for his players. The 41-year-old pleaded with his team to step up amid James’ extended absence.\n“We need all guys to star in their roles,” Redick said, via LoJo Media on X. “I don’t think that changes if LeBron is in the game or he’s not in the game.”\nRedick made it clear that this is the type of mindset he expects from his players, regardless of the situation. The Lakers will be without James for the next few weeks, and they will need to take a committee approach to fill the void. Redick, however, wants to remind each and every player that they will still need to do their jobs even when James returns.\nThe Lakers host Tuesday’s game at Crypto.com Arena with tipoff scheduled at 10:00 p.m. ET.\nLakers Announce Starting Five Decision Ahead of NBA Season\nJJ Redick has made up his mind on his starting five.\nPaolo Songco\nAbout the author\nPaolo Songco\nTrending News Writer, Athlon Sports",
