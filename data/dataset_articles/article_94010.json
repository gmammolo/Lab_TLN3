  "text": "Indonesia faces scrutiny after barring Israeli gymnasts from a world championship in Jakarta, prompting the International Olympic Committee to advise federations against hosting events there. Sports Minister Erick Thohir acknowledges the repercussions, highlighting the intersection of sports and international diplomacy. In a significant move resonating through global sporting circles, Indonesia has chosen to prevent Israeli gymnasts from participating in a world championship held in its capital, Jakarta. This decision has prompted a strong response from the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has advised all international sporting federations against hosting competitions in Indonesia. Erick Thohir, Indonesia's sports minister, acknowledged the potential fallout from this unprecedented stance. In a statement, Thohir emphasized the country's awareness of the consequences tied to its exclusion of athletes based on nationality, positioning this issue at the crossroads of sports and international diplomacy. The unfolding tensions underscore a broader conversation about the role of sports as a unifying force versus its entanglements with geopolitical disputes. As the global sports community watches closely, this development could significantly influence future international sporting event allocations. (With inputs from agencies.)",
