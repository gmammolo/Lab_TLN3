  "text": "– Coast Guard crew members from Station Morro Bay rescued four boaters Saturday after their vessel caught fire while under tow approximately five miles off the coast of Cayucos, according to a report on the United States Coast Guard News website . At 9:30 a.m., Coast Guard watchstanders received a report of a disabled 24-foot motorboat located about 200 yards off Whale Rock in Cambria. A 47-foot response boat crew was launched to assist and began towing the vessel. Around noon, the vessel’s engine caught fire during the tow. The Coast Guard crew released the tow line and instructed the four boaters to enter the water wearing life jackets. The crew then pulled all four individuals from the water and provided first aid. After the fire was extinguished by Morro Bay Harbor Patrol, the motorboat sank. The rescued boaters were transported to Coast Guard Station Morro Bay, where they were evaluated by Morro Bay Harbor Patrol and Morro Bay Fire Department personnel. One individual was taken to a San Luis Obispo hospital with minor burns. The cause of the incident is under investigation.",
