  "text": "DJ Moore Injury Update\nDJ Moore’s recent injury update has been a bit of a rollercoaster the kind of story that reminds you NFL players are every bit as human as the rest of us, just tougher. After the Bears’ tight win over Washington a couple of weeks back, Moore was seen heading to a hospital for a late-night evaluation. Turns out, he’d been dealing with a groin and hip issue that got aggravated during the game. Precautionary, the team said. But let’s be honest when you see a guy loaded into an ambulance after a game, “precautionary” doesn’t exactly make you breathe easier.\nBy midweek, though, there was a bit of relief. Coach Ben Johnson confirmed Moore was back in Chicago, day-to-day, and in his usual quiet, resilient fashion, the wideout got back on the field sooner than many expected. He suited up against the Saints in Week 7 not his flashiest performance (just three grabs for 43 yards), but you could tell he was grinding through discomfort. That’s classic Moore less showboating, more substance.\nOn Twitter, @SleeperBears reported that DJ Moore was spotted at practice but was limited due to a groin/hip injury.\nNow, as Week 8 looms and the Bears gear up for the Ravens, the injury chatter continues. The official report lists his status as “questionable,” with Moore again missing Wednesday’s practice because of that stubborn hip. He’s not alone, either. D’Andre Swift and Cole Kmet were also sidelined. But veterans like Moore often get these midweek “maintenance days.” It’s sort of a polite way of saying, “Yeah, everything hurts, but I’ll be there on Sunday.”\nTo be fair, the Bears need him. Moore hasn’t quite found his rhythm this season, just 240 yards and a single touchdown through five games, but there’s that sense he’s one breakout away. He’s the kind of player who can turn quiet stretches into jaw-dropping moments. Fans know it, his teammates know it, and if you’ve ever watched him drag two defenders for an extra yard, you know it too.\nSo, for now, the update is this: he’s banged up, battling, and probably back soon because if there’s one thing DJ Moore doesn’t do, it’s sit still while his team’s climbing.",
