  "text": "Channel 7 commentator Kate McCarthy has accused the AFL of “lacking ambition” over their planning for the 2025 AFLW grand final.\nThe hosting venue for the showpiece event is determined by the highest-ranked team, which means it can’t be finalised until late in the finals series.\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: AFL ‘lack ambition’ over AFLW grand final call.\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\nHowever, North Melbourne are currently riding a 22-match winning streak and appear near certainties to once host again earn hosting rights.\nMelbourne and Hawthorn are sitting second and third on the ladder, which makes a Victorian grand final all the more likely.\nIkon Park, which has hosted the past two grand finals, has once again been earmarked to host this year’s decider.\nThe past two grand finals have sold out within hours of tickets going on sale, leaving many fans missing out. The venue’s capacity is listed at approximately 13,000, with over 12,000 attending the past two premiership deciders.\nThe AFL-owned Marvel Stadium is often talked about as an alternative venue given it can hold 50,000 people.\nLeague general manager of AFLW Emma Moore last week there are no plans to change the venue.\n“We want to be able to sell out Marvel. We want to be able to create a huge moment around the grand final at Marvel. And when we have that as our problem, that will be the best problem that we can possibly have,” she said.\n“We’re pretty clear that Ikon Park is where we’d have the grand final, should it be held in Melbourne. And we want to absolutely sell it out and create the best spectacle we can around a sold-out stadium experience for our players and our clubs and our fans.\n“It’s a really big step from an Ikon Park to a sell-out at Marvel.\n“And we want to make sure that when people turn up to a grand final for W, it is the absolutely best experience of a grand final that they will experience. Ikon is a premier stadium to hold it at, and it makes sense as a place to hold it with where we’re at now with the growth.”\nBut McCarthy said that decision shows a real “lack of ambition” to grow the game.\n“The first thing I think from that is if we move it to Marvel, I don’t think we’re moving it to Marvel anticipating 53,000 people there. And I think that’s a little bit of a bridge too far,” McCarthy said on Talking W.\n“But I don’t think that should be the reason we don’t move it to Marvel. And the other point on there, we want to make sure that when people turn up for a grand final for W, it is the absolute best experience of a grand final.\n“Is that not playing the game at Marvel? Would we not see better football, no matter what the weather, no matter what the conditions?\n“Will we not see the best spectacle of the biggest game of the year at Marvel Stadium? I don’t think we can accuse the AFL of a lack of planning. I think there’s been a little bit of talk around that. I think it’s great to see that we’ve got the season dates for next year already out, which is something that hasn’t happened in the history of AFLW.\n“But I think it’s a real lack of ambition. If we’re sitting here saying for the third year in a row, let’s sell out the grand final in two hours, another 12,000 people can come. But whoever wanted to come that missed out again, we’re not really caring about growing the game and getting as many people as we can to the biggest spectacle in AFLW for the year.”\nSTREAM ON 7PLUS Watch full episodes of Talking W\nWhen asked how it would look having a half-full Marvel Stadium of around 250,000, McCarthy continued: “So we always hear this, the league’s in its infancy, we need to grow the game. Is 25,000 people at a stadium watching the game better than 12,000 people at the stadium watching the game?”\n“Is that not growing the game and allowing more people to access it and to turn up? And I understand it might not look as good, but ultimately, if we want more people to be able to go to the AFLW, walk away from it saying, ‘wow, that was a magnificent match, we went to the 2025 grand final ... we are absolutely going to be there again next year come Round 1 because we loved that so much and we got the opportunity to go’.\n“We didn’t open up the phone on Saturday and see ‘oh the AFLW grand final is sold out. I was thinking of taking the kids and wandering down, but we can’t now’. I think that’s really limiting who can attend and who wants to attend the AFLW Grand Final.\nStream free on",
