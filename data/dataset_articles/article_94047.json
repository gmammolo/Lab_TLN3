The recovery efforts can have long term effects.\nUpdated: 4 hours ago\n|A woman says her uncle had been dead for days when she found him at an independent living facility in Sun City and workers had no idea. The living facility has not directly responded to questions related to how something like this could have happened but did offer condolences to the family. Angela Boorn is hoping to turn her anger into action to prevent any other family from having a similar experience.",
