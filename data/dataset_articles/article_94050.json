  "text": "SportsView\n·23 octobre 2025\nSportsView\n·23 octobre 2025\nLiverpool snapped their losing streak with a dominant win over Eintracht Frankfurt on the road in the UEFA Champions League.\nLiverpool were down early but rallied to equalise before the Merseyside giants handed the German team a proper beatdown.\nThe Reds claimed a resounding 5-1 win and will take that confidence back to Anfield.\nHowever, it was not all good news for Liverpool as right-back Jeremie Frimpong picked up a hamstring injury in the 19th minute.\nThe Liverpool defender will reportedly be out for some time. Reds boss Arne Slot said he is expected to be sidelined for a few weeks.\nThis is the second time Frimpong has picked up a hamstring injury since his £29 million switch from Bayer Leverkusen over the summer transfer window.\nThe Liverpool coaching staff will hope the Dutchman, who is a ‘special player’, does not spend too long on the treatment table, as they need all hands on deck.\nConor Bradley replaced the 24-year-old and would like to seize this opportunity to claim the starting berth on that flank.\nBradley had a mixed outing for the Reds against Frankfurt. He showed attacking thrust but struggled defensively.\nHopefully, this run of games allows him to find his groove.\nAs for Frimpong, he has not been able to deliver his best in Liverpool colours, and these injuries have not helped.\nHopefully, this reset allows him to come back fitter and better, ready to deliver the goods for the reigning Premier League champions.\nElsewhere, the Reds must be desperate to continue this winning run against Brentford over the weekend.\nAfter that, they take on Crystal Palace in the League Cup and will be seeking revenge for defeats in the Community Shield and the league.\nThe games come thick and fast for Slot’s side as they lock horns with Aston Villa, Manchester City, and Real Madrid before the November international break.",
