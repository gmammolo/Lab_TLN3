  "text": "The exclusion of Sarfaraz Khan from India A’s squad for the upcoming four-day matches against South Africa A has once again fired debates over selection transparency in Indian cricket. Despite impressive domestic performances and a renewed focus on fitness, the 28-year-old batter once again finds himself sidelined and the reactions have been sharp.\nSocial media erupted soon after the announcement, with fans and experts questioning what more Sarfaraz needs to do to earn his place. The biggest voice among them was that of former spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who expressed his dismay on his podcast. “I can’t find any logic behind Sarfaraz’s non-selection in the India A side. I feel very, very sad for him. If I were a selector, what would I even tell him? He’s lost weight, scored runs and even hit a century against New Zealand,” he said.\nALSO READ The day Gavaskar’s bat flew: Malcolm Marshall’s unforgettable Kanpur fury Ashwin further added that excluding Sarfaraz from the India A setup shuts down his pathway to a comeback. “Now, where is he going to prove himself? If he scores in Ranji, they’ll say he’s only a domestic player. But if he’s not even getting selected for India A, how does he show he’s ready for higher levels?” the spinner added.\nIrfan Pathan urges restraint Former all-rounder Irfan Pathan, however, urged restraint, suggesting that the selectors may be following a broader strategy. “Selectors and the team management will always have a plan. Sometimes it might look wrong to fans, but please don’t twist things or create false narratives,” Pathan posted on X.\nALSO READ ‘Stay in the kitchen’: Why the vile abuse of India’s Women cricketers needs to stop Sarfaraz made his Test debut against England in 2024, scoring half-centuries in both innings. He has since played six Tests, totalling 371 runs, including a century against New Zealand. Yet, two low scores in his final appearances seem to have apparently tilted the scales against him.\nThe latest India A squads will be led by Rishabh Pant but Sarfaraz’s absence from both teams was a glaring omission.",
