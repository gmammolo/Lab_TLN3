  "text": "Mike Evans’ 2025 season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers took an unfortunate turn during Monday Night Football against the Detroit Lions after the star wide receiver suffered an injury.\nThe six-time Pro Bowler sustained a broken collarbone in the second quarter of the game after he was tackled by Lions cornerback Rock Ya-Sin. Slow-motion replay of the incident showed Evans falling hard, shoulder-first, before his head also hit the ground.\nWhile Evans was able to get up, he was ruled for the rest of the contest, with the team citing concussion and shoulder issues.\nMike Evans Injury Sparks Major Movement\nIt was certainly a dark moment for the Buccaneers, who are among the best teams in the NFL this season. The injury to Evans is certainly a big blow to a team with playoff and Super Bowl aspirations, especially since the veteran wideout is one of their most reliable weapons.\nEvans has recorded 140 yards and one touchdown on 14 receptions through four games with the Buccaneers.\nWhile a lot of supporters were concerned for Evans, others used the development to support him and bring some positivity to an otherwise sad situation.\nIn the wake of the injury, fans started a donation drive called “$13 for 13” — referring to the Bucs wideout’s jersey number. The donations went to Evans’ foundation, the “Mike Evans Family Foundation.”\n“In less than 24 hours, more than 650 Krewe members have come together to donate $13,000+ to MEFF,” the foundation wrote on Instagram Stories on Tuesday. “As if we weren’t emotional enough already, the $13k is so fitting and has us in our feels.”\nIn its latest update on Wednesday, the foundation stated that it has now received over $16,000 in donations from more than 800 supporters.\nWhat Is the Mike Evans Family Foundation?\nAccording to its website, the foundation “focuses on empowering youth, encouraging education and taking a stand against domestic violence.” On its Instagram bio, the non-profit organization also noted that it provides “scholarships and opportunities for kids in need and to help families impacted by domestic violence.”\nEvans started the foundation in 2017, along with his wife Ashli Evans, who now serves as vice president and secretary of the organization.\nIn its updates, Evans’ foundation stated that it plans to use the donations to give back to the Tampa community in line with its mission.\nWhen Will Mike Evans Return From Injury?\nAs for Evans’ injury, head coach Todd Bowles said after Monday’s game that the NFL veteran would likely be able to return by the end of the year, noting that playing in the postseason is a possibility.\nIn an update from Ian Rapoport on NFL Network, he reported that Evans is set to undergo surgery this week, adding that a “clean break” in his broken collarbone “should have Evans back in eight weeks or fewer.”\nSure enough, hopes are high that Evans won’t encounter any setbacks in his recovery from the injury. For now, fans can only wait and keep supporting Evans.",
