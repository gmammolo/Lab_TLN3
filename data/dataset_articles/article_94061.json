  "text": "The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced that international sports federations will be advised not to hold competitions or meetings in Indonesia after the country barred Israeli athletes from entering, according to BBC Sports.\nIndonesia refused to issue visas to the Israeli gymnastics team participating in the ongoing World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Jakarta, citing Israel’s military actions in Gaza as the reason. The move has drawn criticism from the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) and the Israeli Gymnastics Federation (IGF), which warned that the decision sets a “dangerous precedent”.\nThe IOC executive board, unable to mediate a solution, held a meeting this week and decided to suspend all discussions with the Indonesian National Olympic Committee regarding future bids to host the Olympic Games, Youth Olympic Games, or other Olympic-related events. The restriction will remain until Indonesia provides concrete assurances that athletes from all nations will be granted entry, regardless of political circumstances.\nIn addition, the IOC will recommend that all global sports federations refrain from organising any international events or conferences in the country.\nIndonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel. Despite previous assurances from organisers that Israeli gymnasts would be permitted to compete, their participation was ultimately blocked. Among those affected is Olympic gold medallist and two-time European champion Artem Dolgopyat, who had been expected to defend his world floor title.\nThe IGF appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to either secure Israeli participation or relocate the championship, but the request was denied. Following its meeting, the IOC invited both the Indonesian Olympic Committee and FIG representatives to Lausanne to discuss the issue and reiterated the principle of unrestricted access for all competitors in international sporting events.",
