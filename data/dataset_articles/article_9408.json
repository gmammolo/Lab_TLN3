At the house that I'm at now, they quickly just had a few minutes to grab their things and head out, while other neighbors are not able to do so.\"\nKimak said volunteers are currently stationed in Kerrville, near the disaster zone.\nASHEVILLE MAYOR OFFERS SUPPORT TO TEXAS CITIES REELING FROM DEADLY FLASH FLOODS\n\"We're spread out around the area, doing different mud-out jobs,\" he said.\nKimak said his team will remain on the ground until further notice to continue assessing the recovery efforts.",
