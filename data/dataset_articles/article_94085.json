  "text": "Forget. Forget. Forget. That's the name of the New York Giants' game as they look to move past one of the most shocking fourth-quarter collapses in league history. It's forever a stain on the franchise, but not one that can't be overlooked with a strong bounce-back campaign against the Philadelphia Eagles.\nRelated: Jaxson Dart’s rise just forced Vic Fangio to say the quiet part out loud\nAfter all, Big Blue snuck away with their season's most impressive victory over the Birds in their 34-17 Week 6 stunner at MetLife.\nDefensive coordinator Shane Bowen took a lot of heat — and deservedly so — for the Mile High loss, so his unit will need to step it up Sunday afternoon in Philly if he wants to put some of these not-so-great coaching-change narratives to bed. But that's easier said than done. And a healthy roster will go a long way in giving him the tools to make the rebound happen.\nIf there's one thing that hurts more than Sunday's loss, it's likely — and quite literally — the players appearing on Wednesday's initial Week 8 injury report.\nGiants’ initial Week 8 injury report puts enormous pressure on Shane Bowen\nBelow is the Giants’ Week 8 injury report:\nDid Not Participate in Practice:\n- LB Brian Burns (Hip)\n- SAF Jevón Holland (Knee)\n- CB Paulson Adebo (Knee)\n- DL Chauncey Golston (Neck)\nLimited in Practice:\n- TE Daniel Bellinger (Neck)\n- LB Swayze Bozeman (Ankle)\n- DL D.J. Davidson (Ankle)\n- OT Jermaine Eluemunor (Knee)\n- LB Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles (Hamstring)\n- C John Michael Schmitz (Concussion)\n- WR Darius Slayton (Hamstring)\nFull participant:\n- QB Jaxson Dart (Ankle)\n- K Graham Gano (Groin)\nThis most glaring problem with Wednesday's practice report is the fact that three defensive starters weren't able to participate. The trio of Burns, Holland, and Adebo is a lot of defensive firepower Bowen will need to replace if things don't trend the right way for Sunday.\nAdebo and Holland being out would be a nightmare. As fans saw in last week's 18-point blown lead, the backups aren't equipped to keep this team in tight games. Presumably, Deonte Banks and Dane Belton should step in for them in their absences.\nBurns left Denver in a walking boot, but informed the media it was for safety precautions and nothing too serious. So, it wasn't surprising to see his name in the DNP bucket when the first report was released. After practice, the NFL's sack leader did say he was \"good,\" suggesting he'll be ready to go.\nAnother player who looks ready to go is 38-year-old Graham Gano. He's coming off an IR stint that left the Giants high and dry at the kicking position. Big Blue officially waived Jude McAtamney, signaling some sort of roster change. It's good to know this team likely won't be subject to kicking woes moving forward. Still, groin injuries can linger, so still a name to keep an eye out for.\nAside from the grocery list of impactful defensive pieces being out and Gano coming back, the remaining newsworthy highlight was seeing Darius Slayton's name appear in the limited group. The 28-year-old hurt his hamstring in New York's dismal Week 5 performance against the New Orleans Saints.\nHis addition back into their gameday receiving room is horrifically important for rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, who's done shockingly well throwing to Wan'Dale Robinson, Lil'Jordan Humphrey, and Jalin Hyatt. Seeing that he practiced is a great sign for his availability for Week 8.",
