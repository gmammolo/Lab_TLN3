  "text": "Pakistan Cricket Board suspends its team after Asia Cup humiliation\nSai Vaitla\nPublished - 23 Oct 2025, 11:01 AM | Updated - 23 Oct 2025, 11:03 AM\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has reportedly taken steps to terminate its agreement with the Multan Sultans franchise due to ongoing contract issues. Notably, the board may appoint a new owner for the team and introduce two additional franchises ahead of the 11th season of the Pakistan Super League.\nMultan Sultans, the most expensive franchise in the PSL with an annual fee of around 1.25 billion rupees, had a disappointing campaign in the Pakistan Super League 2025. The Mohammad Rizwan-led team managed only one victory in 10 group-stage matches, finishing last among the six participating teams.\nMultan Sultans Entered the PSL as the Sixth Franchise in 2017\nMultan Sultans joined the PSL as the sixth franchise in 2017, ahead of the tournament’s third season. The team was initially purchased by Schon Properties under an eight-year agreement. However, the PCB terminated the contract the following year due to non-payment of the annual franchise fee.\nDuring the interim, the PCB took temporary control of the players’ and coaches’ contracts and issued new tenders to sell the franchise rights.\nOwnership was acquired by Alamgir Khan Tareen and Ali Khan Tareen in December 2018. Alamgir later became the sole owner in 2021, and after his passing in 2023, Ali Tareen assumed full control of the franchise once again.\nThe 11th edition of the PSL will have to shift its regular schedule due to the World Cup. Notably, the tournament is expected to take place in April or May 2026, which raises the possibility of another scheduling conflict with the IPL.\nPCB Issues Termination Notice to Multan Sultans\nAccording to a report by Saleem Khaliq, Multan Sultans owner Ali Tareen has been critical of the PSL’s management and certain officials. He has used podcasts and social media to question the league’s structure and operations, sparking discussions among fans and cricket analysts.\nThe PCB initially remained silent on these remarks, which led to speculation about the board’s reluctance to respond. Notably, the PCB has now lost patience and sent a notice of termination to the Multan Sultans franchise.\nIf the disputes are not resolved, the team could participate in the 11th edition of the PSL under new ownership. The Pakistan Cricket Board had already commissioned a foreign company to assess the valuation of all franchises after the completion of their 10-year contracts, and the evaluation process is now in its final stages.\nPakistan Cricket Board Reviews Franchise Compliance as Multan Sultans Face Annual Losses\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board is currently examining whether all parties have adhered to their franchise agreements, with future decisions to be guided by the findings. Multan Sultans, which pays an annual fee of around 1.25 billion rupees, has been incurring financial losses each year.\nThe franchise owners have pushed for changes to the league’s structure, but the PCB is restricted from lowering the fee for a single team, as this could reduce the overall value of the league and negatively impact the sale of two new franchises.\nIf the termination of Multan Sultans is finalized, the current owners will be barred from participating in the bidding process for the new teams.\nAlso read: India's Playing XI vs Australia for 2nd ODI announced; Harshit Rana compromised for..\nAbout the Author\nSai Vaitla is an author at Cricketaddictor and he has been working since September 2022.\nSai Vaitla...\nRead more",
