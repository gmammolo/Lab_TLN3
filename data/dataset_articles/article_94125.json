  "text": "Virat Kohli registered back-to-back ducks in ODIs for the first time in his 17-year long career. Returning to international circket after seven months, Kohli failed to score yet again, as Xavier Bartlett sent the veteran batter for a four-ball duck in the second ODI at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday.India lost two wickets in the same over as Bartlett wreaked havoc in Adelaide. The pacer first dismissed Shubman Gill for nine runs, while Kohli followed for a duck. Kohli made a highly anticipated return to competitive cricket along with Rohit Sharma in the ongoing three-match ODI series against Australia. The two legends retired from Tests earlier this year. Before this match, Kohli's numbers at Adelaide in ODIs have been fine, with 244 runs in four innings at an average of 61.00, with two centuries and a best score of 107. Both of his centuries have been historic, one being against Pakistan in the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup, making him the first Indian to smash a WC ton against the arch-rivals.Currently, Kohli (51 tons in ODIs) and Sachin (51 in Tests) are equal for most centuries by a batter in a single format. One more century would mark his 52nd century in ODIs, marking the most centuries by a batter within a single format.Earlier in the match, Australian skipper Mitchell Marsh won the toss and opted to bowl against India in the second ODI.Australia kicked off the three-match ODI series against India with a comfortable seven-wicket win at the Perth Stadium in Perth, taking a 1-0 lead in the series.",
