  "text": "Southeast Iowa Union offers audio versions of articles using Instaread. Some words may be mispronounced.\nWEST LIBERTY — The Fairfield volleyball team saw a couple of really tough sets go the wrong way on Tuesday night when the Trojans faced West Liberty on the road.\nFairfield fell to the hosting Comets 25-22, 25-16 and 25-13 in a Class 3A Region 7 battle, ending the Trojans’ 2025 season.\nFairfield’s top hitter, Leah Helmick, had 10 kills in the loss. Natalie Steele finished with nine, and both Jaden Haynes and Elyse Setterstrom finished with four.\nIsabel McCready was good in the back row, leading the team with 24 digs. Faith Jones dished out 29 assists, and Steele ended the night with three aces.\nFairfield had just four aces as a team. Mallory Wigle had the other.\nThe Trojans ended the season 22-13. It was the last time playing together for six Fairfield seniors.\nEditor’s note: Monday’s story about Fairfield volleyball had a mistyped headline, which confused West Liberty for Thursday’s opponent, in Albia. This headline has been fixed online.",
