  "text": "Well, this is a bummer.\nWhat started like so many others, the quickly fading high school season brimmed with hope and unbridled expectation for the opening weekend in August. It’s two months later, and we’re left with the same ol’, same ol’.\nThe usual cast of characters for the playoffs is back. The usual cast of coulda-shoulda-wouldas is getting ready for postseason banquets and the start of the winter sports calendar.\nSanta Fe High and Capital? Out. St. Michael’s, Los Alamos and Taos? In. Santa Fe Indian School? Another tough year. Robertson’s down but back in. West Las Vegas is up and back for more. Last year’s playoff darling, Española Valley? The jury’s still out.\nWe’re entering Week 10 of the regular season. Next week’s games mark the official end of the road for roughly one-third of the teams in the state. By the end of our first weekend in November, we’ll know who plays where and when in the postseason.\nIt’s been fun so far. Los Alamos and St. Michael’s are still undefeated, while Santa Fe High and Capital both had their chances. Robertson has had an ongoing suspension thing, while McCurdy has dealt with as many off-field issues as they have played actual games.\nHere’s a look at this weekend’s 11-man games and the two college tilts involving teams from our area.\nWe went 6-1 in high school games last week. That does not include McCurdy’s latest no-show that resulted in yet another forfeit. Split the difference with the college games, thanks to New Mexico Highlands getting a last-minute win to avoid a fourth straight loss.\nThe New Mexican is 57-14 for the prep ranks and 12-5 with the big boys.\nThursday\nHighland (5-3, 3-2 in 1-5A) at Capital (2-6, 2-3), 7 p.m.\nThe Jaguars probably sealed their fate by losing to Miyamura last week, which dropped them into sixth place in a district that will likely get no more than five teams into the playoffs. On paper, there’s time to turn things around. The Jags close the season with two games against teams right in front of them, but if we’re being honest, it’s a tough proposition to suggest a postseason run. Capital scored 12 points last week, just the second time all season the Jags have reached double digits. They’re facing a Hornets defense that hasn’t given up more than 21 points to anyone.\nPrediction: Highland 36, Capital 8\nFriday\nHope Christian (6-3, 1-2 in 2-A) at West Las Vegas (4-4, 1-1), 6 p.m.\nBoth teams are coming off deflating losses; the Huskies in a typical Robertson-esque 9-7 slogfest and the Dons in a humbling home shutout against St. Michael’s. West looked like it was sleepwalking against the Horsemen, which, to be fair, is what a lot of teams look like against them. If the Dons bounce back, they basically nail down second place in 2-3A and become a lock for a top-four seed. Hope absolutely needs a win to remain in the top-four hunt, but reality dictates it’s all about landing a home game in the opening round. The forecast calls for Hope to finish fourth in district, which should be enough for a home playoff date.\nPrediction: West Las Vegas 28,\nHope 26\nMoriarty (4-3, 3-2 in 1-4A) at Taos (4-4, 4-1), 6 p.m.\nAt what point is it safe to start believing in the Tigers? It should have happened a while ago. Taos has been a different team since the start of district play, crafting an identity of beating the teams it should and losing large to the teams ranked higher. The Tigers are a playoff lock, which isn’t saying much. There are only 15 teams in 4A, and 12 make it to the show, so this one has the power to lock down a home game in the first round and potentially (with a 6-4 record) land a top-four seed. In short, lots of work to do for a team that has plenty of people wondering what to make of it.\nPrediction: Taos 32, Moriarty 20\nMcCurdy (4-4, 1-2 in 1-2A) at Navajo Prep (6-2, 2-1), 6 p.m.\nAh, yes, the Bobcats. Most teams leave us wondering about Xs and Os, of matchups and injury reports. The question with this year’s McCurdy football team is whether it will actually show up and, if so, behave itself long enough to finish a game. Three forfeits have marred what looked like a promising season, and it’s anyone’s guess if the Bobcats’ bus even makes the trip to Farmington. If it does, will there be anyone on it?\nPrediction: Navajo Prep 1, McCurdy 0\nSaturday\nLos Alamos (8-0, 5-0 in 1-5A) at Valley (3-5, 3-2), 11 a.m.\nLook, we all understand the situation the Hilltoppers face. In a 5A landscape that tilts heavily to the south, the only discussion worth having until the playoff seeds are announced next weekend is if the powers that be consider L.A. worthy of a top-four seed and a first-round bye. The eye test says yes, but both polls that track 5A have the ’Toppers destined for an opening round game despite a perfect record. They close the season with a pair of road games against teams headed for the playoffs, and they’d be wise to win both convincingly. In a world where all it takes is one minor slip to justify sending this team in the wrong direction, the only option is a blowout win.\nPrediction: Los Alamos 44, Valley 13\nSanta Fe High (4-4, 2-3 in 2-6A) at La Cueva (6-2, 5-0), 11 a.m.\nThis city is aching for a Demons (and Jaguars) playoff run, but we all know the story. The last realistic chance Santa Fe High had was an upset win last week at Los Lunas, and it didn’t happen. Now comes a roadie to face the big, bad Bears. La Cueva has appeared in the big-school championship game in five of the last seven seasons, including the last three. It’s a program that produces Division I talent and one that hasn’t lost to the Demons since Clinton was in the White House. At this point, the Demons are playing for pride and a chance to shock the state with something completely unexpected.\nPrediction: La Cueva 52, Santa Fe 13\nBloomfield (7-1, 5-0 in 1-4A) at Española Valley (4-4, 2-3), 1 p.m.\nIf you’re looking for a postseason bubble team, look no further than the Sundevils. Ranked 13th in a 12-team playoff pool, they won’t get much clarification out of this one. The Bobcats roll into town as a defending state champ who has sat atop the rankings all season. They’ve made mincemeat of everyone not named Piedra Vista, winning district games by an average of nearly 53 points. This is, in every sense of the word, a blowout waiting to happen — to which we say, no worries, Sundevils. No one expects you to win. The big one comes next week against Aztec, plus some help from your friends.\nPrediction: Bloomfield 56,\nEspañola Valley 6\nPojoaque Valley (4-3, 1-1 in 2-3A) at St. Michael’s (8-0, 2-0), 1 p.m.\nThe Horsemen have had this game circled in red ink for a while. While they’re riding a 28-game win streak (and a 17-game run against the Elks), the two-time defending champs see Pojoaque as a mouthy, overly confident neighbor who needs to be taught a lesson. The players want this one, and so do the St. Michael’s coaches. The Horsemen are still missing a dozen players due to injury, but with the end of the regular season just around the corner, they will get a bye heading into the playoffs and some extra time to heal. Until then, they’re laser-focused on taking their best shot against an opponent that truly gets under their skin.\nPrediction: St. Michael’s 56,\nPojoaque Valley 6\nSanta Fe Indian School (1-8) at Tohatchi (3-5), 1 p.m.\nThe Braves have finally reached the end of the line. Hopefully, it marks their last as an independent. With realignment coming, SFIS is hoping to move down to 2A next season and give its players a playoff goal to shoot for. What started as a promising run with solid defensive efforts has given way to a rough month on both sides of the ball. SFIS hasn’t scored since mid-September, getting shut out by an average of 50-0 the last four games.\nPrediction: Tohatchi 42, SFIS 6\nBONUS PICKS Saturday\nN.M. Highlands (4-3, 2-3 in RMAC) at Adams State (0-7, 0-5), noon\nThe prospects are good for the Cowboys to reach .500 in conference play. Adams State ranks last in the RMAC in both offense and defense. The good news is the Grizzlies’ punter ranks second in the league in average yardage. Expect a breakout game from QB Collin Stucki. His last-minute magic trick last week was the kind of thing that can rally a team around him. Same, too, for RB Jeffery Jones. The freshman has battled a bum shoulder of late but continues to produce. Enjoy him while you can, NMHU fans. The FCS and FBS recruiters are lurking.\nPrediction: Highlands 45,\nAdams State 17\nUtah State (4-3, 2-1 in MWC) at New Mexico (4-3, 1-2), 1 p.m.\nThe Bronco Bowl. The Lobos have looked forward to this one since then-coach Bronco Mendenhall bailed on his four-year contract with UNM and took the Utah State job after just one season. All that talk about building continuity and pride in the program — Lobos fans haven’t forgiven him, and the team is going all out for his return. The story being beaten to a pulp this week is the turquoise throwback uniforms UNM will wear, but it goes deeper as coach Jason Eck is trying to tap into a culture Mendenhall always talked about but never followed through on.\nPrediction: New Mexico 34, Utah State 31",
