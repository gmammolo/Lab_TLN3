  "text": "Los Angeles Fire Department rescue crews freed 31 workers trapped in Wilmington Wednesday evening after a 18-foot tunnel collapse, with no reported injuries.\nMore than 100 firefighters — including Urban Search and Rescue team members specially trained and certified to handle confined-space tunnel operations — were dispatched to the 1700 block of North Figueroa Street shortly before 8 p.m., according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.\nThe 31 workers boring a tunnel for the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts were reported rescued with no visible injuries at around 9:45 p.m.\nIt was unclear what caused the tunnel to collapse.\nHumphrey reported that preliminary findings suggested\nThe trapped workers managed to climb over a pile of loose soil, estimated to be 12 to 15 feet tall, with considerable effort, Brian Humphrey of the Los Angeles Fire Department said.\nThey were able to reach several coworkers on the other side of the collapse and were taken in groups by a tunnel vehicle to the entry point, which is more than five miles away.\nTwenty-seven workers removed from the tunnel are being medically evaluated by LAFD paramedics at the scene, Humphrey said.\n“When I heard about this partial collapse, I rushed over fearing the worst,” Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn, whose Fourth District, includes Wilmington, said on social media.\n“But we are so blessed tonight that all these men made it out safely”\nHahn is also a member of the districts’ Board of Directors.\nThe incident commander requested that helicopters from television stations be no closer than one mile from the intersection of Figueroa Street and Lomita Boulevard because excessive noise from the helicopters above the rescue site were interfering with the ability of rescue personnel to effectively communicate face-to-face or via radio at ground level.\nThe scene remained under an ongoing investigation Wednesday evening.",
