  "text": "India's tour of Australia 2025\nIND vs AUS: ”End is very near”- Fans react as Virat Kohli bags second straight duck in Australia series\n(Courtesy : Getty Images)\nVirat Kohli was removed by Xavier Bartlett in the second IND vs AUS ODI.\nIndian Cricket Team batter Virat Kohli’s return to international cricket has been forgettable. The premier batter bagged his second consecutive duck of the series against Australia and that too at his favourite ground Down Under, the Adelaide Oval in Adelaide.\nVirat Kohli, who bagged an 8-ball duck in the first game in Perth, was expected to set the stage on fire with the bat in the ongoing second ODI. But, that wasn’t the case as it was an utter disappointment for him and for his fans as well.\nVirat Kohli walked out to bat after Shubman Gill got out early in the innings. Many expected a great show from Ro-Ko, who took the crease together after a long gap of time. However, Kohli’s stay lasted just four balls as he was removed by Xavier Bartlett.\nAfter bowling three outside off deliveries, Bartlett trapped him in the crease for plumb lbw. The ball swung in from a length and caught Kohli at the crease as he tried to flick, but got beaten on the inside edge.\nThis was his second consecutive duck in the series and this is also the first time in his ODI career that he bagged two back-to-back ducks. The crowd got stunned as he walked back but he made sure he acknowledged them by raising his hand in what possibly was his last outing in Adelaide.\nWith talks around his retirement being there, he now would be keen to make a strong comeback in the last match, which will be played in Sydney on October 25.\nFans on X react as Virat Kohli bags his second consecutive duck in the ODI series against Australia\nAs Virat Kohli bagged his second consecutive duck in the ODI series against Australia, fans on X (formerly Twitter) reacted to it. They expressed their disappointment with the batter getting out early and gave some angry reactions. Here are some of them:\nHow many runs did Virat Kohli score in the second IND vs AUS ODI?\nVirat Kohli scored a duck in the second IND vs AUS ODI.\nHow many has Virat Kohli scored in the ongoing IND vs AUS ODI series?\nVirat Kohli has failed to score a single run so far in the ongoing IND vs AUS ODI series.\nFor more updates, follow Khel Now Cricket on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube; download the Khel Now Android App or IOS App and join our community on Whatsapp & Telegram.\nAnkitjit Singh is a dedicated sports journalist whose childhood dream was to play cricket—now, he serves the game through his work.
