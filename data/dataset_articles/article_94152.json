  "text": "Ajax Manager Delivers Chelsea Champions League Verdict After Losing 5–1\n- Ajax head coach John Heitinga delivered his verdict on the Chelsea team that beat them 5-1 in the Champions League\n- The world champions got the massive win in a game that was punctuated by a red card and a series of penalties\n- Chelsea have now recovered from their opening day defeat, while Ajax are still looking for their first points this season\nEducation is Your Right! Don’t Let Social Norms Hold You Back. Learn Online with TUKO. Enroll Now!\nAjax head coach John Heitinga gave his fair assessment of Chelsea after suffering a heavy 5-1 defeat at Stamford Bridge.\nChelsea were ruthless in front of their home fans, capitalising on Ajax's errors to record their second win in this season's campaign.\nAjax captain Kenneth Taylor was sent off for a reckless challenge on Facundo Buonanotte in the 15th minute. Marc Guiu scored from the resultant free-kick.\nA few minutes later, Moises Caicedo let fly for Chelsea's second before Ajax got a slight reprieve down the other end. Tosin Adarabioyo gave away a penalty, which Wout Weghorst calmly converted to halve the deficit.\nATTENTION: Tell What You Think About TUKO and Join the Giveaway.

It was a tough one for us to take, but it is how it is,\" he said via[Metro UK].\nThe former Netherlands defender blamed the red card and a couple of deflections for the heavy defeat.\n\"The game plan was working, and I think it was hard for them to break the lines. We even had one offensive transition with Mika Godts. It was stable. Then the red card happened, and I think they scored two goals from the penalty spot, then two goals were deflected. I cannot blame the players; they were working really hard.\"\nThe win took Chelsea to 11th place in the 36-team table after three games. It was also their fourth consecutive win in all competitions as Maresca continues to find a working system without his star forward, Cole Palmer.\nUp next for the Blues in the Champions League will be an away trip to Qarabag, before that highly anticipated game against Barcelona at home.\nAs for Ajax, they remain rooted at the bottom of the table with zero points. Heitinga is a man under pressure, having only once in the last seven games. Their next games will be at home against Galatasaray and Benfica.\nSupercomputer predicts Champions League winner\nIn a related report, a supercomputer predicted who would win the Champions League after the third round of games.\nArsenal were the biggest winners, beating Atletico Madrid 4-0, while PSG and Barcelona also got huge wins.\nArsenal and PSG are among the five teams that are yet to drop any points so far.\nATTENTION: Deepfakes Are Rising.
