  "text": "Gabby Agbonlahor drags Richarlison for what he did in Monaco vs Tottenham – ‘Some nerve’\nRicharlison was once again unable to replicate his early-season form as Tottenham drew 0-0 against Monaco in the Champions League.\nThe Stade Louis II hosted Thomas Frank’s team on 22 October, and the North London outfit were lucky to go home with a point.\nGuglielmo Vicario was Spurs’ hero on the night as he denied the French club from finding the back of the net on several occasions, including making a save after a shot four yards out.\nWhile most of the players were underwhelming, the former Everton striker was one of the worst players on the pitch and was substituted in the 70th minute.\nRicharlison unhappy after being taken off in Monaco vs Tottenham\nRicharlison looked visibly frustrated as he was replaced by Randal Kolo Muani against Monaco.\nThe Brazil international started up front for the North London outfit but was unable to make an impact as he struggled to get into the game.\nWhile the 28-year-old wasn’t helped by the fact that the Ligue 1 outfit were dominating the middle of the park, his decision-making on the ball was woeful in the final third.\nGabby Agbonlahor slammed the centre-forward for being unhappy about being substituted, writing on X: “Some nerve, Richarlison being angry at being taken off.”\nIn his 70 minutes on the pitch, the striker amassed an xG of 0.1, as per Sofascore, which is nowhere near good enough for the Lilywhites.\nRicharlison could be sold soon by Spurs, and if his performance against the Ligue 1 outfit is anything to go by, with just 20 touches and losing possession eight times, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Frank sanction his exit.\nThomas Frank has to make immediate changes vs Everton\nLucas Bergvall was another player who let Frank down against Monaco, and the Danish manager should look to make multiple changes to his starting lineup for the next game.\nTottenham travel to the Hill Dickinson Stadium on 26 October, and the former Brentford boss will be hoping to get back to winning ways after losing to Aston Villa and drawing to Monaco.\n| Richarlison vs Monaco | Statitstics |\n| xG | 0.1 |\n| Total shots | 1 |\n| Touches (Unsuccessful) | 20 (5) |\n| Possession lost | 8 |\n| Fouls | 1 |\nSpurs have usually played very well away from home, but Frank has now been given issues to resolve after the performance at the Stade Lois II.\nWhile the North London outfit are dealing with multiple fitness issues in their squad, Xavi Simons and Randal Kolo Muani should start in Merseyside at the expense of Bergvall and Richarlison.\nEnjoyed this article?
