  "text": "SALT LAKE CITY — With a retooled roster and aspirations to be among the better teams in the Western Conference, the Clippers opened their 2025-26 season with a thud.\nOutscored by 24 points in the first quarter, they never recovered in a 129-108 loss to the Utah Jazz in the season opener for both teams on Wednesday night. The Clippers struggled to slow the Jazz in the second quarter as well and trailed by 31 points at halftime (78-47).\nA young Jazz team that is building toward what it hopes is a bright future pounced on the veteran Clippers. By the end of the opening period, the Clippers had more turnovers (nine) than shots made (eight) and rebounds (seven).\nIvica Zubac finished with 19 points and seven rebounds and James Harden and Brook Lopez each scored 15 points for the Clippers, but they never made it interesting and still trailed by 28 after three quarters.\nKawhi Leonard added 10 points on 3-of-9 shooting for the Clippers, who appeared confused on the court at times while being handed their most lopsided season-opening loss in 17 years. New addition Bradley Beal was on a minutes restriction in his Clippers debut and had five points.\nWalker Kessler had 22 points and nine rebounds to pace the Jazz, while Lauri Markkanen scored 20. Brice Sensabaugh added 20 points off the bench for Utah, which set a team record for points in a season opener.\nKessler, the longest-tenured member of the Jazz, shot 7 for 7 from the field. He blocked four shots and finished with four assists.\nUtah made its first 19 shots in the paint, as crisp passing and precise ball movement led to layups and dunks.\nWidely expected to finish near the bottom of the NBA this season, the Jazz had 38 assists on 48 baskets and shot 55% from the field. Keyonte George led Utah with nine assists to go with his 16 points.\nAce Bailey, the No. 5 pick in June’s NBA draft, has been ill and was limited to 20 minutes for the Jazz. He scored two points.\nTaylor Hendricks, who sustained a gruesome broken leg in the third game last season, returned to the court and looked bouncy coming off the bench for Utah. He finished with 13 points and five rebounds.\nThe Jazz shot 71.8% from the floor in the first half while building their lead. The Clippers gave up 78 points in a half only once last season, while the Jazz hadn’t scored that many in a first half since the 2023-24 season.\nUtah was 12 for 12 on 2-point field goals and added four 3-pointers in the first quarter.\nUP NEXT\nThe Clippers face the Phoenix Suns in their home opener on Friday at 7:30 p.m. at the Intuit Dome.",
