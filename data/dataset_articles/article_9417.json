  "text": "Next Article\nCentral government allocates ₹1,066 cr for disaster relief\nFloods and landslides have been rough this monsoon, so the central government just released over ₹1,066 crore to help six badly affected states—Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Kerala, and Uttarakhand.\nThis funding is meant for states affected by floods and landslides, which typically involve rescue and recovery efforts, as these regions deal with heavy damage.\nUttarakhand gets the biggest share\nUttarakhand gets the biggest share at ₹455 crore, followed by Assam with ₹375 crore and Kerala with ₹153 crore.\nThe Northeastern states—Manipur, Meghalaya, and Mizoram—each get between ₹22 and ₹30 crore.\nAll six have faced relentless rains leading to serious flooding and landslides.\n104 NDRF teams working across 21 states\nThis isn't a one-off: earlier this year, over ₹6,000 crore from SDRF and nearly ₹2,000 crore from NDRF went out nationwide.\nRight now there are 104 NDRF teams plus Army and Air Force units working across 21 states to help people get back on their feet.",
