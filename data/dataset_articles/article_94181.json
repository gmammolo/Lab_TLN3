  "text": "Leafs Fall Short Against Bethel in Crossroads League Showdown\nThe Maple Leafs fell to the Bethel Pilots in a rivalry match, losing all three sets (25-17, 25-18, 25-17). Goshen led only once early in the first set, with their strongest performance seen in the third set where they tied the score at 15-15 before the Pilots secured the match with a decisive 10-2 run.
