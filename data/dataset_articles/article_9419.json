  "text": "American Legion Post 208 in Kerrville has set up a relief area for both those impacted by the flooding and those first responders performing search and rescue. And the support from other Legion posts has been overwhelming.\nOn Independence Day, heavy showers from earlier in the week caused massive flooding in Kerr County, Texas. In less than an hour, the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet, according to state officials.\nThe results were devastating. With summer camps in place and vacationers in the area, the death toll has risen to 120 people as of July 10. More than 170 people remain missing.\nAnd as first responders continue their daily searches, they’ve found support in the form of the American Legion Family from Post 208 in Kerrville. Just two days after the flooding, the post set up a relief area for first responders, providing snacks, clothing, supplies and more, while also providing a place to sleep.\nDonations have poured into the post, including from Legion posts in Texas and elsewhere (see below). Items also have been made available to members of the community impacted by the flood.\nThe effort actually started with Post 208 looking out for a fellow veteran service organization. “Our post actually sits on the Guadalupe River. And the water did come up Friday morning to the road, but fortunately it did not get to the actual door of our post,” Auxiliary Unit 208 Treasurer-Secretary Lisa Valdez said. “So, by the grace of God we were spared. The VFW in town was not as lucky.”\nWhen Valdez learned that VFW Post 1480 had been flooded and didn’t know when it would be able to reopen, she reached out to Post 208 Commander Robert Garcia. A group text to the post Legion Family’s leadership led to a cleanup effort at Post 1480 the next morning. And that set the wheels in motion.\n“People in town started posting on social media what they were needed,” Valdez said. “We have a bingo hall. Robert and I and his wife (Post 208 First Vice Commander Veronica Garcia) got to talking together … and I said, ‘Why don’t we open our bingo hall, and we’ll start taking donations?’ We just put it out there, and it was just crazy.”\nValdez said Post 208 previously had hosted large district and state Legion events and already had a network in place. “We just started getting phone calls,” she said. “Robert said, ‘We’ll take all the donations’ because people were turning them away. Some places just wanted monetary donations. And we knew we had first responders coming in.”\nValdez was able to pick the brain of her brother, a former firefighter who took part in swiftwater rescue following Hurricane Katrina, to find out what supplies would be needed.\n“We put out a list, and other posts were calling us,” Valdez said. “They just started sending trucks from Missouri and Florida and everywhere. And from San Antonio, people were coming. And we just started stacking donations in a spot where first responders can come in and basically shop for free. Pick up toothbrushes, toothpaste, clean underwear, socks. We’ve got rubber boots in there in case their boots get worn out. A lot of bug spray and ant killer.”\nValdez said the outpouring of donations and support from other American Legion posts has left her “humbled by their outreach and their love.”\nThe post – which is located next to the central command center where Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Department of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem have been working from – also has a mobile medical truck in the parking lot to assist those who experience heat exhaustion or other issues. And a portion of the post hall has been set aside for Kerr County residents to pick up food and supplies as well.\nThe post has basically been operating from 6 a.m. to midnight, but two members of the post have been staying the night to be with the first responders sleeping there. Those hours likely will continue through next week.\nThat kind of dedication doesn’t surprise Valdez, who said she became passionate about Post 208’s Legion Family two years ago after her husband lost his job and she was able to pick up extra work at the post. “I’m grateful for that,” she said. “And because of that, I donate my time back to them every chance I get. It is a family. Whenever someone here needs something, we’re on it. We don’t hesitate.”\nAnd though she said down the road she may look back at what that Legion Family has provided during an overwhelming tragedy, now is not the time for that kind of reflection.\n“Honestly, after it’s all said and done, I would feel very proud … of our post efforts,” she said. “Right now, the mood is very solemn. It’s very hectic. It’s hard to feel anything but sadness right now. It’s just heartbreaking.\n“We’re on the river, so there’s (rescue and recovery) helicopters flying over every five minutes, and every time it does it’s just gut-wrenching. And every day the body count gets higher.”\nTexas Strong. Across the state, Texas Legion posts have stepped up to assist Post 208 with its efforts. The following are just A FEW examples of how other posts in the state are supporting Post 208 in its efforts. Please share your efforts at Legiontown under Volunteering.\n· In Helotes, American Legion Post 309 teamed with VFW Post 7108 and Texas State Rep. Josey Garcia to deliver supplies to Post 208. Post 309 continues to collect supplies for future deliveries.\n· In League City, S. Mike Lacy Post 554 coordinated a community relief assistance effort that included collecting cleaning supplies, insect spray, clothing, drinks and other items. The post said it would make as many trips as needed to deliver items to the impacted area.\n· In Seguin, American Legion Post 245’s Legion Family began collecting supplies on July 6 and took its first truckload for first responders two days later. “We sent everything that had to do with flashlights, batteries, insect repellent, water — everything for first responders,” Post 245 Commander Felisa Ramirez said. “I got a text from one of them saying we need more articles down there, but they’re going to stop at some of the little smaller communities that maybe aren’t getting as much publicity, but are also not getting a lot of response or assistance.” The post continues to accept donations for future deliveries.\n· In Huntsville, Sam Houston Post 95 collected monetary donations for Kerrville families. The donations will be delivered this weekend during the department convention in Austin. “We are Texas proud and need to be there to help when we are called!” the post wrote on its Facebook page.\n· In Harlingen, American Legion Post 205 made a call for items that included blankets, non-perishable food, toiletries, bottled water, cleaning supplies and baby food.\n· In Somerset, American Legion Post 443 donated six cots and picked up six more from American Legion Post 300 in San Antonio. The cots were delivered to Post 208, along with a pallet of water. While members of Post 443 were in Kerrville, they delivered clothing from Post 208 to St. Vincent Church for distribution. “Thank you American Legion Post 208 in Kerrville Tx for leading the charge and providing a place for victims, 1st responders and volunteers to rest. ONE TEAM ONE FIGHT!!” Post 443 wrote on its Facebook page.\n· In Converse, William M. Randolph made a callout for donations of cots and socks for first responders providing relief efforts.\n· In San Antonio, Post 592 learned of the need for cots and water for both Post 208 members and the first responders who have been sleeping at the post each night and were forced to do so on the ground. The request for 20 to 25 cots was met and was to be delivered to the post.\n· Also in San Antonio, John F. Kennedy Post 485 teamed with other entities to collect non-perishable food for Kerrville.\nNationwide Support. Help for those affected by the Kerrville flooding and those providing relief efforts hasn’t been limited to the Lone Star State. Legionnaires and other organizations from as far away as Virginia have offered their assistance as well.\nFrom Colorado, online community Disgruntled Vets teamed with the nonprofit 22 Until None to create an Amazon wish list for people to purchase much-needed items for those on the ground in Kerrville. Disgruntled Vets founder Ryan Hemhauser, a member of American Legion Post 5 in Colorado Springs, moved quickly after learning about the flooding.\n“After hearing about the flooding in Texas, I immediately reached out to our partners at 22 Until None to find a way to help,” Hemhauser said. “We contacted over 20 organizations before connecting with the Grunt Style Foundation, who directed us to Post 208. From there, we worked directly with (Post 208 First Vice Commander Veronica Garcia) to get her a wishlist of urgently needed items. Thanks to our national veteran network, we helped facilitate over 1,500 packages and more than $40,000 in donations sent directly to the post.\n“As a Legionnaire at Post 5 in Colorado, I’ve seen what happens when veterans come together for a cause bigger than ourselves. From Colorado wildfires to hurricanes in New Jersey, I’ve witnessed the power of long-term support – and I’m proud we could stand with Post 208 when it mattered most.”\nIn Virginia, Department Historian David Wallace put out a call for donations on the Department of Virginia’s Facebook page, asking for donations of gift cards and checks. The department will accept donations through July 16.\nAnd in Florida, members of Post 83’s Legion Family in Macclenny organized a donation drive to be delivered to Post 208 later this month. Solicitated items include water, baby food and diapers, pet food and clothing.\nA reminder that Legionnaires and posts in Texas impacted by the flooding are eligible for National Emergency Fund grants.
