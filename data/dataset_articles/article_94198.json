  "text": "Author's note: On October 21, 100 Thieves announced the departures of Zikz and Kess. Boostio was released on October 22. This story has been republished to reflect those announcements.\nWith its offseason underway, seven\n100 Thieves\n100 Thieves\nNorth America\nRank #10\nplayers and coaches have announced the upcoming expiry of their contracts with the organization, as well as the start of their restricted free agency.\nOf the announcements, Peter \"Asuna\"\nMazuryk's may mark the beginning of the end for one of professional Valorant's longest-running loyalties. For all intents and purposes, Asuna has been a one-club man, joining from\nImmortals\nImmortals\nInactive\nin late 2020 and suiting up for 100T ever since. While he's mostly been the team's Duelist player over those five years, he's also played the Initiator role on occasion, namely KAY/O, Gekko, and Skye over the years. Asuna shared that while he is still hoping to maintain his position on the team, he has been allowed to explore his options for the 2026 VCT season. He also said that he is open to playing any role except for scan initiators and as a team's in-game leader.\nThe second-longest tenured player on the squad was Matthew \"Cryocells\"\nPanganiban, who also announced that he was LFT. Cryo had been with 100 Thieves since late 2022, joining ahead of the inaugural season of franchising in VCT. Throughout the years, he has taken on the team's Duelist duties alongside Asuna, as well as filled the team's secondary Controller role. He joined from\nXSET\nXSET\nInactive\n, reaching the international stage alongside players like\nzekken\n,\ndephh\n, and\nBcJ\n. Cryo has crossed paths as a teammate of several current VCT pros throughout his career, also playing with\njohnqt\non\nSoaR\nSoaR\nInactive\nepathy\nNgawang Chonjor\nfiziq\nLucas Blow\nv1c\nVictor Truong\nTrill\nAshley Powell\nand\nkoalanoob\non\nBig Frames\nBig Frames\nInactive\nIn0X\nTheodor Bjornsson\nCryocells\nMatthew Panganiban\nsvL\nSam Laudando\n. He said that he is most comfortable in the Duelist role, but is also comfortable as a Controller or Sentinel.\nKelden \"Boostio\"\nPupello, who has been on 100T's inactive roster since the start of Americas Stage 2, also announced that he is still contracted to the end of the year, but has been allowed to explore his options. He shared, \"I miss competing and playing in front of you guys. I really want to get back to the top and win another championship to prove I'm not a PIG.\" The former IGL, who helped 100T lift the Americas Stage 1 trophy in 2024, joined in the offseason prior off the heels of a Champions-winning campaign as the IGL of\nEvil Geniuses\nEvil Geniuses\nNorth America\nRank #18\nNaturE\nNicholas Garrison\nsupamen\nPhat Le\nyay\nJaccob Whiteaker\n.\nDrew \"Kess\"\nLee joined shortly after Boostio's benching was announced, and joined as the team's go-to Sentinel player while also flexing onto the secondary Controller and Initiator roles on occasion. He joined from North American Challengers squad\nQoR\nQoR\nNorth America\nRank #7\nnerve\nMichael Yerrow\nLogan\nLogan Coffey\nalym\ntoozy\nAnthony De Leon\nDark3st\n, but boasts a long list of VCL teams he played for before that. He had been in the scene since 2021, having played for\nHeathens\nHeathens\nInactive\nBacchus\nsylph\nser1ez\nKess\nDrew Lee\nThisKetchupSpicy\n,\nZer0 Latency\nZer0 Latency\nNorth America\nRank #237\n,\nLG Orange\nLG Orange\nNorth America\nRank #29\nPepegaPig\nmateo\nKIMCHI\n1papaya\nPhilip Ng\n, and\nNightblood Gaming\nNightblood Gaming\nNorth America\nRank #16\nScrewFace\nKyle Jensen\nNotexxd\nJaden Anderson\nsonofcar\nkumi\nsmiley\nSteven Fisher\n. Once an Initiator player, Kess shared in his announcement that he is open to playing all roles except Duelist.\nAlexander \"zander\"\nDituri joined 100T last offseason from\nM80\nM80\nInactive\n, looking to replace\nbang\n, who departed for\nSentinels\nSentinels\nNorth America\nRank #5\nN4RRATE\nMarshall Massey\nZellsis\nJordan Montemurro\nzekken\nZachary Patrone\njohnqt\nMohamed Amine Ouarid\n. The Canadian joined after two years with M80, which saw back-to-back defeats in Americas Ascension grand finals, before finally landing with a VCT squad. He was the team's primary smokes player throughout the year, but after Boostio's benching, he was thrust into the IGL role. zander led 100T to a 3-2 finish in the group stage, but the team fell just three games into the playoffs, finishing 5th-6th in the region. He shared that 100T is evaluating a \"full rebuild\" and that he is looking to play the Controller or Sentinel roles for a new team, and that he is comfortable as an IGL.\nHead coach Anthony \"Zikz\"\nGray also shared that he is seeking positions as a head coach, general manager, or director of esports. He joined 100T ahead of the 2024 season alongside Boostio, spending time as EG's assistant coach during the Champions-winning run. The 2023 season was Zikz's first and only with EG, as he joined from spending time with\nNRG\nNRG\nNorth America\nRank #1\nbrawk\nBrock Somerhalder\nmada\nAdam Pampuch\nskuba\nLogan Jenkins\nEthan\nEthan Arnold\nin 2022. The former League of Legends coach, who also coached 100T's LoL squad from 2019 to 2021, is not the only member of the 100T coaching staff entering restricted free agency.\nAssistant coach Yura \"frenya\"\nElkin, who joined ahead of the 2025 season after a long spell in Europe, also announced the end of his 100T contract. With experience both as a head coach and coach in EMEA Challengers circuits and Game Changers squads, frenya shared that he is seeking coaching opportunities at the VCT and VCL levels.\nWith seven members of the organization — five players and two coaches — announcing their restricted free agency,\n100 Thieves\n100 Thieves\nNorth America\nRank #10\n' full roster is now:",
