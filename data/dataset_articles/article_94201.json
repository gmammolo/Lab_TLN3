  "text": "Midway through the college football season, it appears an unusual number of high profile coaches have already been fired, including Florida’s Billy Napier, who previously had a successful career at the University of Louisiana.\nA week ago, Penn State fired James Franklin, who helped resurrect a once-proud program that had taken a dumpster dive in the wake of the Joe Paterno scandal. Franklin’s firing that includes a nearly $50 million buyout, came on the heels of firings at Oklahoma State, where long time coach Mike Gundy was sent packing, and Arkansas, among others, sending seismic shockwaves throughout the coaching community.\nIn all seven FBS coach have been fired since the start of the season, and the combined buyouts of those coaches are a tad north of $110 million, seemingly a daunting number but not in this era of 10-figure television contracts.\nDisturbing perhaps, but not necessarily surprising, Southeastern Louisiana University coach Frank Scelfo said during his weekly press conference Monday.\n“When you have that many people involved in the financial support of the program, then (donors) get a voice in the program,” Scelfo said. “This will be touchy, but when (donors) are able to dictate how the administration handles their employees then you are going down a slippery slope.\"\n“Athletic directors can say they control it, but they really don’t.”\nHe said when a university solicits sponsors for substantial donations to support facilities and coaches’ contracts, then some of the control is ceded to the donors.\n“(Donors) are not just going to open up the checkbook without a voice,” Scelfo said. “That is not going to be what happens.\n“Some of (the donors) become disgruntled (when a program like Florida or Arkansas underperforms) and they are making the call, saying get (the coach) or we are going get you (the athletic director) out, and that is what is taking place.”\nAccording to USA Today, influential boosters had recently met with Florida officials regarding future donations as being directly related to Napier’s status.\n“When you relinquish control based on financial aspects you have to be careful,” Scelfo said. “It is a slippery slope; a lot of these places are going down.”\nHe said administrators can put their spin on it, but the firings are being controlled by the people with deep pockets outside of the university. Scelfo admitted that especially for young coaches, the landscape continues to change, and off-the-field pressures are becoming more challenging, but he said there are other professions to pursue.\nHe added he chose the coaching profession, “it did not choose me.”\nScelfo said to “play in this game” a coach has to be open to changes and adapting to this new frontier of NIL, transfer portals, and bottomless pits of television money being directed to the big schools, especially the Power Four, where the higher pay comes with inflated expectations.\nHe noted that at Southeastern large donors are not as numerous, so fewer people are involved.\n“But if somebody came in here with a big check, they could get me out of here tomorrow,” he joked. “And I’ll take the (buyout) check and walk out the door.”\nBut even in these days of endless disruption, Scelfo is proud SLU has been able to maintain the majority of his staff the past few years. The Lions did go through one stretch with four defensive coordinators in four years but current coordinator Billy D’Ottavio has spent the past three years in that position.\n“We try to provide a great atmosphere for them,” Scelfo said of his staff. “We want to improve some of the benefits they receive and it is getting better each and every year.”\n“Hammond is a great place to live, raise a family, and we have some good things on campus, some good things in the community,” he added. “We have a close-knit group of guys and they like success.\n“And we have had a lot of success the last eight years and want to continue that.”\nHe said the stability of the coaching staff has played a critical role in the Lions’ success. He said that familiarity allows for players and coaches to know each other and understand the expectations.\nCurrently, the Lions--coming off of a 49-0 blanking of Northwestern State--sit tied atop the Southland Conference standings with Lamar and Stephen F. Austin. But in a new twist in a reconfigured conference schedule, SLU will face Lamar but not Stephen A. Austin.\nThe Lions, 5-2, 3-0, are on the road Saturday for a 2 p.m. kick off at Houston Christian, 2-5, 1-2.\nSLU’s defense has pitched two consecutive shutouts and the Lions have outscored their past three opponents 132-31. In fact, Southeastern has outscored its FCS opponents 233-55.\n“I think we are doing good stuff,” Scelfo said. “I think this staff is outstanding and the team is really good.”\n“Some people did not believe that early on in the season,” he said. “They didn’t see it, but we saw it from the beginning.\n“We have a good football team, and we’ll see how things play out.”",
