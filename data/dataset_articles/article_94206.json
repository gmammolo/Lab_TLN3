  "text": "LOS ANGELES — Deandre Ayton is the NBA equivalent of a participation trophy. He’s big, he’s tall, and he’s got a college mixtape that makes you think, “Wow, this guy could be something.” But then you watch him play, and it’s like the mixtape was made by someone else. The Los Angeles Lakers, in a desperate attempt to find a center who could spell LeBron James, traded for Ayton.\nThe result? A 119–109 loss to the Golden State Warriors on opening night, where Ayton contributed a stellar 10 points, 6 rebounds, and 1 block in 34 minutes. That’s right, folks—34 minutes of basketball and Ayton managed to get zero assists.\nNot a single dime. Not even a hockey assist. Just 10 points and 6 rebounds. If that’s the definition of a “dominant center,” then I’m the next LeBron James.\nA FANTASTIC FINISH TO OPEN THE NBA SEASON\n— NBA (@NBA)\nSGA jumper to send it to OT\nAlpi putback to force 2OT\nSGA hits the GW FTs\nRockets, Thunder deliver an instant classic out West![pic.twitter.com/4LMYQlPBm3][October 22, 2025]\nAyton’s performance was a masterclass in mediocrity. He was about as impactful as a cardboard cutout of a center. He didn’t move the needle; he didn’t even move his feet. He was there, in body, but not in spirit. His defense was as nonexistent as his effort. He stood around, watched the game unfold, and occasionally remembered he was supposed to be guarding someone. When he did decide to show up, it was to commit a turnover or pick up a foul. His basketball IQ? Let’s just say it’s not on the same level as his shoe size.\nThe Lakers’ desperation move to acquire Ayton last year has done absolutely nothing. They traded for a player who was supposed to be a cornerstone, a building block for the future. Instead, they got a guy who can’t even set a proper screen. The Lakers are stuck with a center who doesn’t rebound, doesn’t defend, and doesn’t seem to care. It’s like they traded for a Ferrari and got a tricycle.\nAnd let’s talk about LeBron James. The Lakers’ roster is constructed around him, and his massive contract is handicapping the team. LeBron is a legend, no doubt, but he’s also 41 years old. The Lakers can’t keep relying on him to carry the team. They need to build for the future, but instead, they’re stuck in the past, paying for a player who’s past his prime. Until LeBron is gone, the Lakers won’t win. They need to get a real center, someone who can anchor the defense, grab rebounds, and set screens. Ayton is none of those things.\nIn conclusion, Deandre Ayton is a bust. He’s a name on a jersey, a body on the court, but not a player who can help the Lakers win. The team needs to move on from him and find a real center. Until then, they’ll continue to be stuck in mediocrity, watching Ayton stand around, collecting paychecks, and doing nothing. The Lakers deserve better. The fans deserve better. And most importantly, the game deserves better.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
