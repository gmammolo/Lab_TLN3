  "text": "By Kevin Vesey ,\n23 hours ago\nThe race for Nassau County executive reached a boiling point Wednesday as Republican incumbent Bruce Blakeman and Democratic challenger Legislator Seth Koslow faced off in a fiery News 12 Vote 2025 debate.\nFrom the opening statements, the tension was palpable. The two candidates talked over each other and exchanged sharp attacks while discussing issues ranging from crime and taxes to government transparency.\nOn the issue of public safety, Blakeman accused Koslow of supporting cashless bail.\n“He’s pro-criminal,” Blakeman said. “This is the guy who supports cashless bail. He wants to expunge criminal records.”\nKoslow pushed back hard, criticizing Blakeman’s record on fiscal management and accusing the county executive of misusing taxpayer money.\n:\n“He’s wasting our tax dollars—millions of dollars on no-bid contracts, millions of dollars in legal fees to defend his terrible actions as county executive,” Koslow charged.\nThe heated tone continued throughout the debate, with Blakeman asserting that he runs Nassau County “like a business,” while Koslow accused the incumbent of corruption and cronyism.\n“He has no plan because he’s getting richer,” Koslow said. “All of his buddies are. That’s corruption, and that’s what he’s doing.”\nBlakeman fired back, warning that electing Koslow would lead to “more crime, higher taxes, and lower home values.”\nBoth campaigns held viewing parties as the debate aired on News 12.\nThe full debate is available to watch below. It will re-air Sunday at 11 a.m. on News 12.\n1",
