  "text": "Embiid Struggles in 76ers’ Season Opener Win; Maxey Shines with 40\nThe Philadelphia 76ers opened their season with a narrow 117-116 victory over the Boston Celtics, yet star player Joel Embiid's performance raised significant concerns. He scored just four points on 1-of-9 shooting, finishing with a game-worst minus-16 over 20 minutes. Despite the win, Embiid appeared physically compromised, struggling with mobility and jumping ability, prompting worries about his health. Meanwhile, teammate Tyrese Maxey excelled with 40 points, and rookie VJ Edgecombe scored 34, marking a standout debut. Coach Nick Nurse tried to emphasize positives from Embiid's outing, which many critics view as overly optimistic given his struggles.\n- Joel Embiid: 4 points on 1-of-9 shooting in 20 minutes.\n- Tyrese Maxey: 40 points scored in the game.\n- VJ Edgecombe: 34 points, the highest scoring output for an NBA debut since Wilt Chamberlain in 1959.\nWhile Coach Nurse highlighted Embiid's \"good decisions\" and ball movement, critics argue that expecting minimal performance from an MVP and reigning scoring champion indicates denial about his current state. The significant injuries and surgeries Embiid has endured present a critical view of his ability to play at a high level.\nState of Play- Embiid's mobility issues are raising alarm bells regarding his long-term health.\n- Tyrese Maxey and VJ Edgecombe provided a strong offensive display to secure the win, but Embiid’s struggles overshadowed that success.\nIf Embiid's performance does not improve, the Sixers may need to reconsider their strategy moving forward. Increasing medical scrutiny and possibly reducing his playing time may be necessary to manage his health as the season progresses.\nBottom LineEmbiid's concerning performance in the opener casts uncertainty over his future contributions to the team. The 76ers must navigate his health challenges carefully to remain competitive this season, as the spotlight now shifts to how they manage his on-court effectiveness.\nRead more at CBS Sports\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
