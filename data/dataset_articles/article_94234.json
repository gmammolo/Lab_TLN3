  "text": "Watch: Rohit Sharma urges Virat Kohli to walk off after 2nd straight duck vs AUS\nAUS vs IND: Virat Kohli was dismissed for his second consecutive duck in India's second ODI against Australia in Adelaide. Rohit Sharma advised him to walk off and not opt for a review.\nVirat Kohli’s recent run with the bat hit another bump in India’s second ODI against Australia in Adelaide on October 23, as he was dismissed for his second consecutive duck in the series. After being bowled by Xavier Bartlett, Kohli briefly considered taking a review, but turned to teammate Rohit Sharma for guidance.\nRohit, reading the situation clearly, told him to walk off, believing the ball had hit the stumps. This marked the first time in Kohli’s ODI career that he had been dismissed for back-to-back ducks, a rare low point for the superstar.\nWatch the video here:\nThe moment left fans disappointed but also reflective. As Kohli waved to the Adelaide Oval crowd while heading back to the pavilion, retirement chatter immediately resurfaced on social media, with many wondering how long he and Rohit Sharma might continue at the international level and whether they would feature in India’s 2027 ODI World Cup plans.\nKohli’s woes followed a similar start in Perth, where a wide delivery from Mitchell Starc had undone him in the series opener.\nKohli's sad Adelaide swansong\nAdelaide Oval has been a stage where Virat Kohli’s class often shone brightest. He first caught the cricketing world’s attention there in January 2012, compiling a measured 116 in the fourth Test that marked him as a serious talent in red-ball cricket. The 2014-15 Border-Gavaskar series saw him dominate the pitch again, with twin hundreds of 115 and 141, reinforcing his ability to control a match and its momentum.\nOver time, Kohli added white-ball heroics to his Adelaide resume, including a memorable performance against Pakistan in the 2015 World Cup. Yet, in what could well be his final appearance at the iconic venue, his outing was over in just eight balls.\nAfter Kohli’s early exit, Rohit steadied the innings with a measured 73 off 97, building a 118-run partnership with Shreyas Iyer and stabilising India’s innings. This was a notable improvement after his own dismissal for just 8 in the first ODI, and his innings helped ease the pressure following the quick departures of captain Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli.",
