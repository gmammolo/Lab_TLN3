  "text": "DACOSTA CUP\nProtests, red cards highlight Kemps Hill loss to STETHS\nPublished:Thursday | October 23, 2025 | 12:08 AM\nAshley Anguin/Gleaner WriterA MUST-SEE clash between St Elizabeth Technical High School (STETHS) and Kemps Hill High at the STETHS Sports Complex turned ugly yesterday, with the visitors and officials engaging in hostile exchanges.\nThe ISSA daCosta Cup Zone 2 game was a one-sided affair with the home team maintaining their unbeaten run, courtesy of a 4-0 win.\nSTETHS’s Kaieem Lewis broke the deadlock, converting the penalty he earned when he was brought down by Kemps Hill goalkeeper Omario Chambers in the 42nd minute.\nThe penalty seemed the nexus of Kemps Hill’s issues with the officials, as Chambers was sent packing in the 43rd minute for using foul and abusive language towards the referee.\nSTETHS’s RJ Newman wasted little time in making the man’s advantage count, scoring in the 48th minute before Lewis piled on the pressure with the completion of his brace.\nKemps Hill had even more reason to feel aggrieved later on when Shemar Daley dribbled into the box and seemed to have been brought down, only for a no-call to surprise supporters. Kemps Hill’s Ricardo Dean was immediately shown a red card for foul and abusive language to the officials.\nKemps Hill players refused to continue playing the match, standing still with an empty goal behind them. STETHS’s Wayne Brown capitalised on the show of solidarity from his opponents and tapped into an empty net, logging an 88th-minute effort.\nHead coach of STETHS, Omar ‘Rambo’ Wedderburn, said the team achieved their objective.\n“The objective was to get all three points, because that is the best thing about the game — to get a positive result,” Wedderburn said.\n“We don’t care about what the opponent wants to do. We just have to stick to our tasks and make sure we get the job done,” Wedderburn added.\nMeanwhile, when The Gleaner approached Kiegon Mitchell, head coach of Kemps Hill, he was hauled away by members of the coaching staff and was told not to comment.\nOne person shouted to The Gleaner: “Go and talk to the referee and ask him for a comment, because it is his game. We have nothing to say.”\nMitchell was called by phone later for a comment, but the attempts proved futile.\nThe win means STETHS lead the group on three points, boasting a plus-four goal difference, while Ocho Rios, who also have three, trail after their game against Old Harbour High ended 1-0 in their favour.\nYesterday’s games\nCornwall 6-1 Maldon\nOcho Rios 1-0 Old Harbour\nGlenmuir 1- 0 Maggotty\nDinthill 2-0 Manning’s\nMcGrath 2- 0 Manchester\nChristiana 3-0 William Knibb\nGarvey Maceo 0-0 Clarendon College\nSTETHS 4-0 Kemps Hill",
