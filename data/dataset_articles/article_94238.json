Derrick White and Jaylen Brown each scored 25 points, but neither took the last shot, with Payton Pritchard missing two final attempts. Tyrese Maxey starred for the 76ers with a remarkable 40 points, while rookie VJ Edgecombe made history with 34 points in his debut, the most since Wilt Chamberlain in 1959.\n- Tyrese Maxey scored 40 points for the 76ers.\n- Rookie VJ Edgecombe scored 34 points in his NBA debut.\nWhile the Celtics showcased strong performances from their leading scorers, the decision-making at the end of the game raised questions about their late-game strategy, particularly the choice to have Pritchard take the final shots instead of their stars.\nState of Play- The Celtics are now 0-1 to start the season, facing immediate challenges in late-game execution.\n- The 76ers begin the season with a victory, bolstered by standout performances from their emerging players.\nThe Celtics will need to reassess their closing lineup and decision-making heading into their next games, focusing on capitalizing on their shooting strengths in crucial moments.\nBottom LineBoston's loss underscores the importance of leadership in high-pressure moments, highlighting the need for established stars like White and Brown to take charge when it matters most.\nRead more at CLNS Media\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
