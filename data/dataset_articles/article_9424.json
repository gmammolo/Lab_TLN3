  "text": "More than 30 people were rescued after a tunnel under construction collapsed in Wilmington on Wednesday night.\nThe 31 people, all presumed to be workers, were removed and received medical assessments, but none had visible injuries, said Brian Humphrey, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department.\nMore than 100 firefighters responded around 8 p.m. near Figueroa Street and Lomita Boulevard, including members of the urban search and rescue team. By 9:15 p.m., all missing persons were removed, Humphrey said. The workplace site is east of the 110 Freeway and north of Pacific Coast Highway.\nThe tunnel, which measures 18 feet in diameter, was being constructed for municipal wastewater management and is a City of Los Angeles effort known as the $630 million Clearwater Tunneling Project . It collapsed about five to six miles south of the tunnel’s only access point, Humphrey said.\nInvestigators believe some of the trapped workers pushed over a pile of loose soil between 12 feet and 15 feet tall to meet some of their co-workers on the other side and be shuttled several at a time to the access point on the surface.\n“We don’t have any information about the nature of the collapse yet,” said Michael Chee, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts.\n“What I just got a report on is that 31 crew members were down in the tunnel. They have all been extricated safely. There are no significant or major injuries that I know of,” Chee said. “We understand that our crew that was working down in the tunnel boring machine, which is approximately five miles heading towards the coast from this point, and it was designed to build the tunnel about seven miles long before it reached the coast.”\nAuthorities said OSHA will investigate the collapse, which is standard with workplace accidents.\nMayor Karen Bass said she talked to workers and said they were relieved and had been calling their families.\nThe collapse was expected to delay completion of the tunnel project. The contractor for the tunnel is Dragados USA Inc.. a tunnel-boring machine specialty company.\nThe City of Los Angeles has mobilized resources to the tunnel collapse in Wilmington.\nMore than 100 LAFD responders have been deployed, including Urban Search and Rescue teams.\nThank you to all of those who are acting immediately to respond to this emergency.\n— Mayor Karen Bass (@MayorOfLA) July 10, 2025",
