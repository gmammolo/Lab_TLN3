The 31-year-old has been a solid piece on the blue line for the Habs. Meanwhile, Patrik Laine is also in the final year of his four-year, $34.8 million contract.\nAd Trending Expand Tweet Ad The 26-year-old Finnish star overcame injuries and personal challenges last season to score 20 goals in limited action. Here's how Montreal Canadiens fans on X (formerly called Twitter) reacted:\nOne tweeted:\n\"Laine big mistake signing.\" El 666 @El66620 @DailyFaceoff Laine big mistake signing Ad Another chimed in :\n\"Matheson, sure. Laine, hell nah. No way they are working on it.\" Here are some of the other top reactions on X:\n\"Thankfully the insider is Pagnotta and he’s always wrong,\" a third fan wrote . \"Matheson yes but Liane I doubt . He does not fit in here and with others waiting in the wings they will move on if not this year then in the off season,\" one X user opined . Ad \"If Laine signs an extension then Hughes needs to get fired,\" another fan wrote . \"Sorry but Laine shouldnt get an extension, unless its 1.5M for a year MAX,\" another chimed in . NHL insider provides latest around Mike Matheson and Patrik Laine's contract situation with Montreal Canadiens According to NHL insider David Pagnotta of \"The Fourth Period,\" extension talks for Matheson began over the summer, with the defenseman interested in staying with the Canadiens.\nAd It could be a three- or four-year extension, though Matheson may seek a slightly higher amount. Matheson has racked up five points through two goals and three assists this season.\n\"They had dialogue over the summer. They re-engaged in that in preseason, and they’re going back and forth right now. It’s an open line of communication. He’d like to stay. The Habs would like to do it, but how does that work? Are we talking about a three-, four-year extension? I think he wants to be in that range, depending on term,\" Pagnotta said via Daily Faceoff. For Patrik Laine , extension talks occurred in the summer and were revisited in the preseason. However, both parties are currently taking a cautious approach. Laine has one point in five games this term.\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?
