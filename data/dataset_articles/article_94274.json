  "text": "Former Chelsea star Joe Cole labelled Tosin Adarabioyo as “clumsy” for his error in the win against Ajax on Wednesday night.\nThe Blues ran riot in the Champions League as they recored a 5-1 win against the Dutch giants to make it two wins from their first three games.\nMarc Guiu, Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez, Estevao Willian and Tyrique George were all on the scoresheet on a comfortable night for the Blues.\nJoe Cole criticises Tosin Adarabioyo\nEnzo Maresca made a number of changes from the side which beat Nottingham Forest, and it was pretty much the perfect night for the Blues.\nChelsea’s task was made that much easier by Kenneth Taylor’s first half red card, with the only disappointment not keeping a clean sheet.\nTosin gave away a penalty with the score at 2-0, which Wout Weghorst converted, and both Cole and Eidur Gudjohnsen were critical.\n“It was clumsy,” Cole told TNT Sports.\n“In modern football, you cannot dangle a leg. He dangles his leg.\n“Any of these players now, they feel a little bit contact, they go down. The goalkeeper needs to do better there [too] because Weghorst doesn’t put it into the bottom corner.”\nGudjohnsen added:\n“When you’re a man up, you don’t want to concede and you don’t want to nibble at a striker running at you.\n“You just want to stand your ground and stay on your feet. It was a silly challenge, really.”\nIt wouldn’t be a surprise if Tosin started against Sunderland on Saturday after he was replaced by Trevoh Chalobah at half time.\nChelsea youngsters shine on the big stage\nWhilst Ajax didn’t put up much of a fight, it was a great night for a number of Chelsea’s young stars as the club’s Champions League goalscoring recored was broken twice.\nGuiu became Chelsea’s youngster scorer in the competition, before Estevao scored to snatch the record, and the Blues had three teenagers score on the night.\nThere was also another outing for talented academy star Reggie Walsh, who Maresca admitted is a player he really likes, and the future does look bright.",
