  "text": "NEWARK, N.J. – If this was how dangerous the Devils were playing their second game in as many nights, imagine how much more of a handful they would have been to face if they were rested.\nAs is, the Wild had their fill, getting challenged by New Jersey in all three periods in a 4-1 loss Wednesday at Prudential Center that could have been more lopsided if not for an admirable effort by goaltender Filip Gustavsson.\nThe red-hot Devils stayed that way with their sixth straight win, while the Wild (3-4-1) will return home from this five-game road trip with a measly three points out of a possible 10 after winning just once.\nMatt Boldy’s third-period goal prevented the Wild from getting shut out for the first time this season, but New Jersey’s Nico Daws was otherwise unbeatable en route to 29 saves.\nHow it happened\nGustavsson finished with 31 saves, giving up only three goals (the fourth New Jersey goal was an empty-netter) despite the quantity and quality of the Devils’ chances.\nHe made three saves on an early penalty kill, caught a break when New Jersey botched a 3-on-1 look and rattled off 13 stops in a row before the Devils finally converted. Paul Cotter buried a one-timer in tight with 3 minutes, 39 seconds to go in the first period.\nAfter Gustavsson denied a breakaway for Jack Hughes, who had a hat trick in his team’s victory at Toronto on Tuesday and six goals in his previous three games, New Jersey doubled its lead on a point shot from Brenden Dillon through traffic at 6:08 of the second.\nThe Devils added another 4:53 into the third, with Arseny Gritsyuk burying a faceoff win on the power play for his first NHL goal.",
