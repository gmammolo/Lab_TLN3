  "text": "Virat Kohli was dismissed for zero in back-to-back ODIs, with Xavier Bartlett taking his wicket early. India faced a shaky start as Kohli chose not to review his dismissal, raising concerns over his form.\nNew Delhi: Indian cricketer Virat Kohli was dismissed for a duck for the second consecutive ODI. This is quite surprising, as Kohli is considered one of India's finest batsmen.\nThis record marks the first time in ODI history that he has been dismissed without scoring a run in two consecutive matches. The match was played against Australia at the Adelaide Oval.\nIndia vs Australia 2nd ODI: Will the pitch, weather and early wickets favour a surprise turnaround?\nAfter winning the toss, Australia captain Mitchell Marsh decided to bowl first. India started with Shubman Gill and Rohit Sharma. Both batsmen played cautiously, but Shubman Gill was soon dismissed. Virat Kohli then came to bat, and the crowd expected a big innings from him, especially given his good record at the Adelaide Oval.\nBut Kohli didn't do much and was dismissed for a duck. Kohli was dismissed by young Australian fast bowler Xavier Bartlett. This was his first over, in which he had previously dismissed Shubman Gill.\nBartlett's delivery was of a good length, inswinging towards Kohli. Kohli tried to flick it off the back foot towards mid-wicket, but the ball missed his bat and hit his pads. The bowler appealed, and the umpire gave him out.\nAfter his dismissal, Kohli briefly spoke with Rohit Sharma and then decided not to use DRS (Decision Review System). He returned to the pavilion for zero after playing four balls. It was a disappointing moment for him.\nVirat Kohli has been dismissed for zero in the second consecutive match, the first time in his career. Xavier Bartlett took the wicket in his first over. Shubman Gill also departed early, giving India a shaky start. Kohli did not use DRS and was dismissed without scoring.\nIND vs AUS 2nd ODI: Only two runs away, Can Rohit Sharma make history against Australia?\nThis incident has dealt a significant blow to India's batting order, especially as the poor form of a key player like Kohli could impact the team's fortunes. It's a matter of concern for the team that Kohli needs to improve his batting performance soon in the upcoming matches.\nNo related posts found.",
