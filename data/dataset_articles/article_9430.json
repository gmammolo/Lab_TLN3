  "text": "Local Firefighters Make “Good Stop” After Stroudsville Home Ignites\nSTROUDSVILLE, TENNESSEE: (Smokey Barn News) – Firefighters from across Robertson County made a good stop Wednesday afternoon after a Stroudsville-area home became engulfed in flames and smoke. Crews attacked the fire aggressively, battling not only the flames but also extreme temperatures, and managed to preserve about 40% of the structure.\nThe home is located in the 1300 block of Stroudsville Rd., just outside of Adams, the first call coming into 911 at 4:03 PM. MAP According to officials, all residents and pets were safely out of the home when fire crews arrived.\nThe caller told dispatchers that the fire may have started in the middle of the one-story home and quickly spread. A critical detail reported to 911 early in the call was the presence of 20 pounds of gunpowder stored inside the garage, adding to the danger for first responders.\nThick smoke was visible through the trees as crews arrived. Firefighters from multiple agencies were dispatched, including Adams Fire, Pleasant View Volunteer Fire, Cross Plains, White House Community Volunteer Fire, Springfield Fire, and Montgomery County, which sent several personnel on the closest available truck. Robertson County EMS and EMA also responded to the scene.\nUpon arrival, crews found heavy fire and smoke showing, and the fire was spreading into the attic. Crews moved quickly to get the fire under control, with command reporting progress on overhaul operations around 6 p.m.\nThe fire was officially marked under control at 5:38 p.m., but crews remained on scene for some time to monitor hotspots and begin overhaul efforts.\nAccording to officials, approximately 60% of the home was damaged by fire, smoke, and water. Pleasant View Volunteer Fire Chief Duncan told Smokey Barn News, “It was a good stop.” The home had undergone multiple additions over the years, which created structural complexities, such as multiple attic access points, that made firefighting efforts more challenging once the fire reached the attic. Despite the obstacles, about 40% of the home was saved, Duncan said.\nOne of the residents was transported to an area hospital with smoke inhalation. No other injuries were reported.\nAt this time, the cause of the fire has not been released.\nThis is a developing story. Smokey Barn News will provide updates as they become available.",
