  "text": "In hindsight, while Sam Allardyce was not everybody’s cup of tea, the decision to hire him as West Ham United’s manager following their relegation from the Premier League in 2011 would reap rewards for years to come.\nIt was Allardyce, leading the Hammers back to the top flight at the first time of asking, who paved the way for the success they would go onto enjoy under Slaven Bilic and David Moyes. Both on home soil and on the continent.\nIn an era where many a club has tumbled out of Premier League, falling into financial ruin and sporting obscurity, who knows where West Ham United would have ended up if it wasn’t for Allardyce’s steady hand.\nMany of the players who flopped for Avram Grant, meanwhile, would be rejuvenated under his leadership. Carlton Cole helped fire the Hammers to promotion with a career-best 14 league goals.\nJulian Faubert credits Allardyce with saving his Upton Park career after a miserable spell under Grant. Now, speaking on the latest edition of the Ironcast podcast, former fan favourite centre-half Winston Reid admits that the booming voice of ‘Big Sam’ proved to be the soundtrack to his own revival.\nWinston Reid reflects on nightmare start at West Ham United\nBy his own admission, Reid endured a ‘nightmare’ start to life in England following his £4 million arrival from Danish outfit FC Midtjylland.\nHe was pulled from pillar to post on his Hammers debut, by future teammate Stuart Downing no less, in a 3-0 opening day defeat by Aston Villa. That was one of only seven appearances he made en route to relegation, suffering the same fate as the aforementioned Faubert.\n“To be honest, I remember I played on the Sunday [for Midtjylland]. The sporting director called me and said, ‘we are pretty close to doing a a deal with West Ham’. I jumped on a plane and signed with West Ham on the Wednesday, and that was it,” Reid says.\n“I played right-back in my first ever game. Oh, it was terrible. [The step up] was huge. The physicality, the pace and speed. I thought when I came over here that I was quick and strong. I wasn’t. Seriously.\n“You have to build it up over the years and you get cleverer [with experience]. But I remember my first game, I was playing right back against Stuey [Downing]. I still have nightmares from that game!\n“It took me until the Championship season [to settle].”\nReid admits Sam Allardyce saved his Upton Park career\nThat Winston Reid departed as a West Ham hero a decade later owes much to the impact Allardyce had on his formative career. The New Zealand legend bounced back from haunting beginnings to make over 200 appearances for the club, winning the Hammer of the Year award along the way.\n“100 per cent [Allardyce improved me]. He made me way better than when I originally came to the club,” Reid adds in conversation with former centre-back partner James Collins.\n“The thing is with Sam, either you sort of thrive under his leadership or you don’t. You know how he is. He’s not strict because he has the other side of him as well. But he demands hard work, all these things. On the pitch, you’ve got to handle him shouting at you to do better.\n“And you remember the meetings after [in the dressing room]. I’ve seen players crumble. When you came into those meetings, you didn’t want to be the one who messes up. It creates a bit of responsibility, calling people out. It’s good.\n“He’s quite an imposing figure as well. A big boy! But, honestly, for me he was really, really good. I have nothing negative to say about him. He helped me in so many ways and, then outside the pitch, he would always have a joke with you.\n“If you made a mistake, he would show you on the highlight clip on the Monday; ‘What the hell were you thinking?’.\n“Even though he would have a pop at you on the pitch, he would always be good after.”",
