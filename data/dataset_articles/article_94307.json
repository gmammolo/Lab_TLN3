Despite the honor, the 20-year-old playmaker voiced frustration with the result following⁣ the 3-1 ⁢loss.\nYildiz, ⁣who wore ‍the armband from the start, ‍described the⁤ experience as “incredible,” stating, “Obviously this feeling in this⁢ stadium is incredible, ‍the first time I leave with the captain’s armband: it’s fantastic.”‌ However, he acknowledged the team’s disappointment, adding, “I’m a little⁤ angry about the​ result because it was a great match, ⁢but that’s how it went.”\nThe defeat leaves Juventus in 25th ‍place in the⁣ Champions ‍League ‌group stage with 2 points​ from 3 matches. Yildiz emphasized ‍the need for consistent focus, stating, “Created ‍a lot? ⁣In ‍these matches‍ everyone is ⁤ready, it’s not often you play at the Bernabeu: they were strong, congratulations ‌to them. We have to‍ face every opponent ⁣seriously,this is the thing we have to do in Serie A as ‍well as in‌ the Champions League.” He was substituted in the 74th minute.",
