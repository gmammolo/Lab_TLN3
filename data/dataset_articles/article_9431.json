  "text": "In response to the devastating floods that swept through Central Texas and the Hill Country, Graham Media Group and Gray Media have joined forces to launch an urgent donation drive supporting local relief and recovery efforts, “Together for Texas”. They said: “The July 4 floods uprooted families, destroyed homes, and left entire communities reeling. While recovery will take time, there is a critical need for shelter, supplies, and support. The campaign raised more than $120,000 in donations in its first 24 hours, including a $25,000 donation from Gray. Graham Media Group is making an additional $15,000 donation to the campaign.”\nThrough this collaborative campaign, Graham Media Group’s KSAT San Antonio and KPRC Houston and Gray stations across 113 markets in the U.S. aim to generate donations that deliver vital resources — including food, housing, and financial aid — to impacted communities. All of the funds raised will support on-the-ground efforts in flood-affected regions, they say.\n“Graham Media Group is proud to partner with Gray in supporting the Salvation Army’s critical emergency disaster response in Texas,” said Catherine Badalamente, Graham Media CEO. “As broadcasters, we have a responsibility to not only inform our communities about breaking news but to help them in times of crisis. The Salvation Army’s rapid response teams are providing essential services to flood victims, and we’re honored to contribute to these life-saving relief efforts during this devastating time.”\n“Gray is committed to serving the affected communities for as long it takes and we are honored to partner with Graham Media Group and The Salvation Army on this important effort,” said Pat LaPlatney, Gray co-CEO and president. “We are grateful to viewers for what has already been a generous response to this call for assistance.”\nHow to Help: Donate at www.togetherfortx.com. All donations will directly support local relief and long-term recovery in Central Texas.",
