  "text": "The wait between the end of one season and the start of the next often feels like forever for NBA fans. Rather than a meager five months, it feels like 15. However, for the Brooklyn Nets, it was.\nBrooklyn Nets stung by Charlotte Hornets in 2025-26 season opener\nThe first cut is the deepest?\nYou know the story. The Nets fully committed to a rebuild two summers ago, but then had to wait over a full year to start cashing in on any of assets they received as payment for that decision. Then, when the time came to do so, they made a historic withdrawal, adding an NBA record five players via the draft. That only added to the anticipation for opening tip.\nBut now, that’s the past. It’s the start of the 2025-26 season. Tonight is about about the future for the Nets, perhaps more than any night ever has been.\nBrooklyn didn’t get to feature all their rookies this evening in Charlotte, as Danny Wolf missed the game with a left ankle sprain. However, they did start Ben Saraf, who became the first rookie picked at No. 26 to start a game since Vonteego Cummings. If you’re looking for your next ace on Immaculate Grid, he played three seasons from 1999-2002 with Golden State and Philly.\nAlongside fellow starters Cam Thomas, Terance Mann, Michael Porter Jr., and Nic Claxton, Saraf and company provided a rather curious start to the game from an offensive standpoint. The Nets poured in 32 points in the first period, probably smashing the over for anyone crazy enough to take it. Michael Porter Jr. dropped eight points in half the minutes to open up the game.\nThat said, Brooklyn’s offense looked out of sync trying to get into their sets, even for day one on the job. Several possessions ended in heaves with the shot clock ticking down. They pilled up five turnovers and got much of their scoring from charity stripe. Outside of the 32-point figure and a few smooth shots, like the first career bucket for Egor Dëmin, who came off the bench five minutes into the game, things were shaky.\nThe defense, however, was rough to begin the game, and there was no arguing otherwise.\nThe Nets gave up 38 points in the first quarter and then 39 the next to give Charlotte a 77-60 lead at halftime. The Hornets closed the first half on a 28-8 run. Soft weak side defense from Brooklyn made scoring in their halfcourt easier than ordering takeout. Their transition defense was even worse, as Charlotte led them in that department 18-0 at halftime.\nIt was so bad, you couldn’t even use Mann being in foul trouble as an excuse. In his Nets debut, the former Clipper and Hawk chipped in 13 points, a rebound, and an assist while shooting 4-6 from the field. When he started the second half despite carrying four fouls, Charlotte blew the lead up to 22 points less than five minutes into it anyway.\nThings stayed in that 20-15 point bubble for the entire third quarter, even after Jalen Wilson and Tyrese Martin both provided short, but noteworthy sparks amid the blowout. JWil finished a team-high +10, scoring eight points after shooting 2-4 from deep.\nDrake Powell also got some burn to close out the third. He stayed on the floor in the fourth to play with Nolan Traoré too, the last available member of the Flatbush Five to make his debut. There, each got their first NBA points, with Traoré splashing a 3-point look surrendered by the Charlotte defense and Powell going coast to coast on a transition take. Those were each guys only points for the game.\nBrooklyn managed to cut it to 13 with about seven and a half to go, but all that did was encourage Charlotte to hit the gas in transition again. They orchestrated on a 9-0 burst that made it a 128-106 with a little over five to play. Brandon Miller led the way for them, pitching in 25 points while shooting 8-19 from the field and 2-9 from deep. LaMelo Ball added 20 points, two rebounds, and eight dimes, going 7-15 from the field and 4-8 from downtown.\nAs for our boys, Claxton led in the scoring department with 17 points shooting 8-12 from the field and also pulling down four rebounds. Day’Ron Sharpe added 14 points after making all but one of his seven field goal attempts, knocking down a triple as well.\nDëmin notched 14 points, four rebounds, and two assists while shooting 4-6 on threes. Saraf dropped eight points, four assists, and snatched seven rebounds after shooting 2-7 from the field.\n“I was happy with both,” Fernández said of Dëmin and Saraf. “It’s going to be a process. Even Nolan getting in and getting some minutes. Those minutes are important. You have to try to win your minutes…That’s great experience, following game plans and knowing personnel. You get your feet wet right there.”\nThere were no shortage of Nets who had evenings to forget, but Cam Thomas and Porter Jr. should be first in line to take their tapes to the oven. Thomas added 15 points but shot just 2-9 from the field. Porter Jr. contributed with 12 points, four boards, and five assists, shooting just 2-9 since after that first quarter. It was a rough start to the season for the two shooters expected to carry the Brooklyn offense. For Thomas, in a prove-it year, he’ll thankfully have 81 more tries to make up for it.\n“If your best scorers don’t score, it’s gonna be a tough night, but you still gotta give yourself a chance,” Fernández said. “Like, I don’t care if Mike and CT have a rough night, we still have to fight, maybe double team more, hustle, run, offensive rebound, and be there to try to fight for the game. It cannot be like ‘Oh, they don’t score. We lost.‘ It doesn’t work that way. Always give yourself a chance no matter what.”\nBy almost all standards, this opening episode to the season was a dud. The excitement and anticipation I talked about earlier likely dissipated for many of you quickly when the score went from close, to large, to embarrassing.\nHowever, it wasn’t for nothing.\nLet me put it to you this way. I don’t exactly look forward to getting up each morning at 6:30 a.m. to workout. I don’t believe anyone does, even all those fitness content creators oozing with cheerleader energy. But once you hit that first rep or take those first steps, you feel better about yourself. It hurts. It sucks. It’s growing pains. But it feels better because you’ve started.\nThat’s what tonight represented for the Nets. Did they drop a weight on their face? You bet. But this a season where we’re set up to see tangible development, and it’s just getting started.\nFinal: Charlotte Hornets 136, Brooklyn Nets 117\nInjury Report\nDrake Powell eventually joined Danny Wolf on the bench, appearing to suffer a lower body injury midway through the fourth. He dealt with a left knee tendinopathy injury over the offseason that caused him to miss summer league, but played in Brooklyn’s final batch of preseason games.\nAs for Wolf, it was reported on the YES broadcast that he injured his ankle during shoot around this morning. We’ll have updates on that as soon as they’re available.\nMilestone Watch\n- Four rookies made their NBA debut for the Nets tonight, marking just the fourth time four rookies have debuted in the same game in the Nets’ NBA history and the first since 11/2/90 (Kurk Lee, Jud Buechler, Derrick Coleman & Tate George).\n- Egor Dëmin (3-of-4 3FG) was the first rookie in Nets franchise history to make three 3-pointers in his NBA debut.\n- Day’Ron Sharpe scored 12 points (5-of-6 FG, 1-of-2 3FG) in nine minutes off the bench in tonight’s first half – tying for the third-most points he’s scored in any half in his career.\n- Ben Saraf became the second-youngest player to start a game in Nets franchise history tonight at 19 years, 191 days old, trailing only Derrick Favors (19 years, 174 days old when he made his first start for the Nets on 1/5/2011).\nJordi Fernández Speaks with YES\nBefore tonight’s game, Fernández also sat down with Meghan Triplett to talk through his own development as a coach going into his second season and that of his rookie class.\nThe not-so-young coach, at least now in his eyes, touched on the importance of continuity, his thoughts on each member of the Flatbush Five, and commitment to giving Brooklyn a team its proud to root for.\nNext Up\nBrooklyn’s home opener will feature the Cleveland Cavaliers, a satellite team subtly supported by many fans either due to their extensive inventory of ex-Nets or their position as the only team standing in the way of the New York Knicks and a Finals berth.\nToo early in the season to be thinking that way? Probably. Regardless, Brooklyn will host the Cavs Friday night at 7:30 p.m. The game will also feature a halftime performance by Brooklyn-native Kota the Friend, new concessions, a party on the Ticketmaster Plaza, and the launch of a Berō merchandise capsule collection.
