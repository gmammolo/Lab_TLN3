However, the All-Star slugger finished the regular season with a woeful .199 average and .638 OPS in 138 games.\nDodgers outfielder Michael Conforto using postseason roster snub as motivation Michael Conforto has not played a postseason game for the Dodgers this year and his last postseason appearance was with the New York Mets in 2015. However, the outfielder remained hopeful of making a World Series appearance.\nAd “I am just trying to enjoy this experience and soak it all in and trying to stay ready if they need me in this series or the next one,” Conforto said during the NLCS. “But definitely not being on the roster is motivating, so I have some things I have to work on and go into the offseason and take care of those things and we’ll see what happens.” The All-Star outfielder has been excluded from the Dodgers' roster for the wild card, division and championship series and is unlikely to feature in the Fall Classic, unless an injury to the likes of Kike Hernandez or Alex Call.\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?

Thank You for feedback About the author Chaitanya Prakash\nChaitanya Prakash is an editor who covers US Sports at Sportskeeda. His first brush with sportswriting was in 2012 when the greatest football manager of all time, Sir Alex Ferguson, bid farewell to the beautiful game.\nAlthough having started out professionally as a cricket writer in 2022, Chaitanya's curiosity and indiscriminate interest in all sports in general eventually introduced him to America's favorite pastime.\nWhile Chaitanya's favorite player from the current crop is the dynamic Venezuelan Ronald Acuna Jr., his all-time favorite, however, is Pedro Martinez, for his self-belief and consistency. He also rates Jose Bautista's iconic bat flip in 2015 as his favorite moment in baseball history.\nChaitanya specializes in reporting on technical aspects of the game or analyzing patterns behind specific plays. He also likes pondering over players' self-assessments following the conclusion of a game as it helps him get an idea of how they think about the sport in general.\nWhen not cheering for his favorites across sports, Chaitanya likes being transported to the past through a good war documentary or a historical documentary in general.\nKnow More",
