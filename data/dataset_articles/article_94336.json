  "text": "Adelaide/IBNS: In a continuation of his poor form as a batter, India's cricket icon Virat Kohli on Thursday returned to pavilion without scoring for the second time in the ongoing ODI series against Australia.\nKohli, who has already retired from Tests and T20Is, was dismissed leg before wicket by Xavier Bartlett for a duck in the second ODI in Adelaide.\nVIRAT KOHLI GONE FOR HIS SECOND DUCK OF THE SERIES!\n— cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau)[#AUSvIND]|[#PlayoftheDay]|[@BKTtires][pic.twitter.com/jqIdvMeX9T][October 23, 2025]\nIn the first ODI which was played in Perth, Kohli too was trapped by Mitchell Starc and caught by Cooper Connolly at backward-point from an outside-off length delivery that he edged.\nKohli, who announced his retirement from Tests ahead of the England tour earlier this year, returned to 22 yards after quite a long time.\nThe former skipper, who is currently based in London, had posted a cryptic note on his cricketing future.\nRubbishing his retirement rumours, Kohli had written on X, \"The only time you truly fail, is when you decide to give up.\"\nThe only time you truly fail, is when you decide to give up.\n— Virat Kohli (@imVkohli)[October 16, 2025]\nIndia were defeated by Australia in a rain-interrupted first ODI where 26 overs were allocated for sides by seven wickets.\nThe two teams will play three ODIs in total against each other.\nSupport Our Journalism\nWe cannot do without you.. your contribution supports unbiased journalism\nIBNS is not driven by any ism- not wokeism, not racism, not skewed secularism, not hyper right-wing or left liberal ideals, nor by any hardline religious beliefs or hyper nationalism.
