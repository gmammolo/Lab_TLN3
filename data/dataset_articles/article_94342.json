  "text": "Virat Kohli 'deceived' as nightmare Australian series continues with second duck in a row\nIn what is likely to be Virat Kohli's final appearance at the iconic Adelaide Oval, the Indian veteran was outsmarted by the young Xavier Bartlett to continue a dismal ODI series so far.\nKohli has a brilliant record at the famous ground, averaging 52.70 in Tests and before the second ODI, he was averaging 61 in the white-ball format.\nHowever, after a duck in the first match, Kohli was walking off Adelaide Oval with the same total.\nREAD MORE: How Anasta orchestrated two-club contract that rocked NRL\nREAD MORE: 'Worst ride ever': Trainer's wife rips 'sissy' Everest-winning jockey\nREAD MORE: Drastic step taken as netball crisis hits new low\nBartlett had dismissed Shubman Gill earlier in his over to make the score 1-17.\nThe Queensland quick then bowled two deliveries outside off stump which were left by Kohli. His third delivery to him was pushed closer to the stumps and defended.\nThen Bartlett speared the next ball full into the stumps and Kohli was trapped on the pads given out lbw.\nHe then considered a review with Rohit Sharma at the other end but decided to walk off.\n\"That is huge,\" Mike Hussey said on Fox Cricket.\n\"He knew the plan was going to be wide of off stump so Xavier Bartlett decided OK, I've hung a few outside off stump, maybe I'll attack the stumps for one and it deceived Virat Kohli.\"\nIn a classy move, the Adelaide Oval celebrated Kohli's brilliant career, standing and applauding him as he walked off. Kohli then raised his right arm to acknowledge the crowd.\nWhen ball tracking arrived, it showed Kohli made the right decision to walk with three red lights showing.\n\"(Barlett) will be able to talk about that wicket for the rest of his life,\" Hussey said.\n\"People will ask 'what's the biggest wicket you've got in your career?' Virat Kohli would be very high on the list I would've thought.\"",
