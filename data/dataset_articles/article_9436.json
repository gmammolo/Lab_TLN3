Instead, what we found was victory,\" she said. \"All of the men that were in that tunnel, rescued, up, safe.”<>pThe tunnel is being constructed almost entirely underneath public right-of-way. The structure is 18 feet wide and will be 7 miles long to carry treated wastewater from across Los Angeles County to the Pacific Ocean.<>pAuthorities said work will not resume until the project contractor assesses what happened and deems it safe.<>p",
