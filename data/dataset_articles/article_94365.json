  "text": "Virat Kohli bags back-to-back ducks, waves goodbye to fans at Adelaide Oval\nAustralia vs India, 2nd ODI: Virat Kohli's much-awaited Adelaide swansong ended in disappointment as the former captain was dismissed LBW for 0, registering back-to-back ducks in the three-match series.\nIt was not meant to be for Virat Kohli. The former captain’s much-awaited swansong at Adelaide Oval ended in disappointment on Thursday, October 23, as he was dismissed for 0. Kohli was trapped LBW after failing to cover the line of an inswinging delivery from medium pacer Xavier Bartlett in the second ODI of the three-match series against Australia.\nKohli appeared distraught after being given out by the on-field umpire, walking back after facing just four deliveries in the second ODI at one of his favourite hunting grounds. Australia struck twice in the seventh over, removing captain Shubman Gill and Kohli after a cautious start from India, who were sent in to bat.\nThe dismissal came after Kohli had bagged his first ODI duck in Australia during the series opener in Perth, where he chased a wide delivery from Mitchell Starc. His off-side struggles resurfaced in Adelaide — though he initially left deliveries outside the off stump, he was undone by one that seamed back into him.\nKohli briefly considered a review, but his batting partner Rohit Sharma advised against it, as the ball appeared to be hitting the stumps.\nLAST MATCH AT ADELAIDE OVAL?\nIn a poignant moment, Kohli acknowledged the Adelaide crowd with a wave as he walked back to the pavilion. The fans responded with a standing ovation, aware that it might have been his final outing at the iconic venue. Kohli ends his career at Adelaide Oval with 976 runs — the most by a visiting batter at the ground.\nWATCH: VIRAT GETS STANDING OVATION IN ADELADIE\nVIRAT KOHLI GONE FOR HIS SECOND DUCK OF THE SERIES#AUSvIND | #PlayoftheDay | @BKTtires pic.twitter.com/jqIdvMeX9T— cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) October 23, 2025\nThere was disappointment written on the faces of the Indian fans who had turned up in large numbers to watch Virat Kohli weave his magic at one of his favourite hunting grounds. However, they made sure the former captain received his due, giving him a heartfelt ovation as he made the slow walk back to the dressing room.\nKohli had looked sharp in the nets, training intensely for the Adelaide Oval clash. The crisp sound of the ball meeting the middle of his bat echoed in videos shared on social media, giving fans hope of a classic Kohli innings.\nHe appeared charged up in the dugout as the opening partnership between Shubman Gill and Rohit Sharma unfolded. Yet, once in the middle, he was undone by a momentary lapse in concentration.\nThe chatter around Kohli’s future is expected to grow louder as the star batter continues to struggle on his return to international cricket. Both Kohli and Rohit marked their comeback to competitive action in this series — their first outing since the IPL 2025 season in June.\nThe lack of match practice was evident in the series opener against Australia in Perth, where both senior batters failed to find rhythm. Rohit was dismissed for 8, while Kohli fell for 0, bagging his first ODI duck in Australia.\nEven on Thursday, Rohit appeared rusty, finding it difficult to put bat to ball, especially against Josh Hazlewood. The Indian captain played out two maiden overs against the seasoned pacer and crawled to 19 off 43 deliveries. Rohit also survived a close run-out appeal in the first powerplay but dug in deep, refusing to throw his wicket away even after India lost two early wickets.",
