  "text": "The Celtics explain who the ball was supposed to go to and why that didn't happen at the end of their opening night loss to the 76ers.\nThe Boston Celtics started the 2025-26 season with a stinging loss. They fell 117-116 in a rivalry clash vs. the Philadelphia 76ers on the TD Garden parquet. It was a game they appeared to have control of in the late stages.\nWith 3:47 left, Neemias Queta was able to corral a Derrick White alley-oop and release from above the rim with enough touch for it to rattle around the cylinder and drop through the net.",
