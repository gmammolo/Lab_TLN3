  "text": "Following the poor run of Bayelsa United in the ongoing Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) season, the management of the club has given a two-game ultimatum to players and coaches to start winning matches or face dire consequences.\nThe Chairman of Bayelsa United, Dr. Tarilaye Nwankwe, who gave the order at an emergency meeting with coaches and players on Wednesday (yesterday), said the ultimatum will start from this weekend’s encounter against Warri Wolves at Delta State University Stadium, Ozoro, Delta State and the home fixture with Plateau United on October 31, 2025.\nHe pointed out that the management would no longer entertain such underwhelming performance going forward.\nSPONSOR AD Nwankwe noted that the ultimatum became imperative due to the team’s poor performances in recent times particularly last Sunday’s shocking home loss to newly-promoted Kun Khalifat.\nThe debutants stunned Bayelsa United 2-1 for their first away victory of the season.\n”The government of Bayelsa State has invested heavily on the club, and so far, the results have been far from impressive.\n“We cannot continue with such performances. The investment must reflect on the pitch starting this weekend.\n”This is not a witch-hunt but an honest and concerted effort in ensuring that all involved in this club key into our philosophy of making Bayelsa United one of the foremost clubs in the country,” he said.\nJoin Daily Trust WhatsApp Community For Quick Access To News and Happenings Around You.",
