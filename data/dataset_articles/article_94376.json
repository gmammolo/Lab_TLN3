[image credits: Netflix.com] WWE Saturday Night's Main Event is set to take place on November 1 at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Stamford-based promotion has already announced world title matches for the event.\nAd Also, this special event will take place before Survivor Series: WarGames, which makes the show more interesting. During the buildup, WWE has already made three mistakes, and in this article, we will examine those blunders.\n#3. Jey Uso in the World Heavyweight Championship match again Expand Tweet Ad Trending Insane Vince McMahon ideas that got canceled - Watch Here !\nJey Uso managed to survive until the end on RAW this week and emerged as the winner in the Men's Battle Royal match. The YEET Master even eliminated Jimmy Uso, seemingly betraying him. The WWE Universe has already expressed its disappointment on the internet with Jey's victory.\nWWE also uploaded the video on their official YouTube channel, which has received massive backlash from fans. This indicates that the Triple H creative regime has already made a major mistake by placing Jey in the world title bout.\nAd Instead of the former world champion, The Game should have booked LA Knight, Finn Balor, or someone else to face CM Punk at Saturday Night's Main Event.",
