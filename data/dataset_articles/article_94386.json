Russell closed Wednesday's 125-92 loss to San Antonio with six points (1-6 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 4-6 FT), two rebounds and three assists across 15 minutes.\nRussell played just 15 minutes off the bench, a worrying sign for anyone who took a chance on him in drafts. While there had been speculation he would come off the bench, the hope was that he would still see enough playing time to warrant a spot in most fantasy leagues. Those who took a chance on him might want to wait another game or two before cutting bait, just in case the result had something to do with his limited playing time.\nMore News Mavericks' D'Angelo Russell: Likely to begin year in bench role 9H ago • by RotoWire Staff Mavericks' D'Angelo Russell: Ready to face LAL 7D ago • by RotoWire Staff Mavericks' D'Angelo Russell: Won't play Monday 9D ago • by RotoWire Staff Mavericks' D'Angelo Russell: Modest performance Saturday 11D ago • by RotoWire Staff Mavericks' D'Angelo Russell: Deals five assists in preseason win 16D ago • by RotoWire Staff Mavericks' D'Angelo Russell: Signing with Dallas 06/30/2025 • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Basketball Stories 2025-26 NBA Injury Updates Dan Bruno • 5 min read 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings, sleepers, busts Ross Kelly • 5 min read Fantasy hoops awards predictions Joel Bartilotta • 6 min read Fantasy basketball busts JP Aravena • 4 min read 2025-26 Breakouts Jermey Schneider • 5 min read 2025-26 Sleepers Mike Barner • 4 min read",
