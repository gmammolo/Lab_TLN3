  "text": "By Anthony Chiang ,\n2 hours ago\nFive takeaways from the Miami Heat’s season-opening 125-121 loss to the Orlando Magic on Wednesday night at Kia Center. Next up for the Heat (0-1) is a trip to Memphis to face the Grizzlies on Friday before returning home:\nThe Heat’s revamped up-tempo offense was on display in the opener, and the results were positive for most of the night. But the Heat then hit a late-game scoring drought that cost it the game.\nAfter pulling ahead by eight points — 109-101 — with 7:49 left in the fourth quarter, the Heat scored just 12 points the rest of the way. The Heat shot just 3 of 13 (23.1 percent) from the field and 1 of 6 (16.7 percent) on threes during this game-deciding stretch.\nThat allowed the Magic to rally, closing the game on a 24-12 run to complete the comeback in what turned out to be a competitive game that included 10 lead changes and 13 ties.\n“It was one hell of a basketball game,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said after the loss. “Going back and forth, stylistically, it’s slightly different than previous Heat-Magic games. But the competitive nature of it was definitely there from both teams. And it really just comes down to a couple different plays and possession basketball.”\nThere was an important moment with the game tied at 115 and 3:01 left in the fourth quarter, as the Heat challenged an offensive foul call on guard Norman Powell. But the Heat lost the challenge, leaving Miami with just one timeout the rest of the way.\nThe Magic and Heat again found themselves tied at 119 with 1:13 to play. But Orlando guard Desmond Bane scored the game’s next four points to help the Magic take control and pull ahead by four points with 37.3 seconds left on the way to the victory.\nTurnovers ruined the Heat’s chances of escaping with the victory, committing seven turnovers over the final 8:58 of the game that the Magic capitalized on for 10 critical points. Among the most costly Heat turnovers was a five-second violation on an inbounds pass that was called with the Magic ahead by two points and 3:45 left in the fourth quarter.\nThe Magic ended the night with 25 points off 19 Heat turnovers.\nThat late-game drama came after a first-half offensive explosion from both teams.\nThe Heat and Magic combined for a high scoring first quarter that included 77 points. It went down as the highest scoring quarter of any Heat-Magic game ever.\nThe Heat started fast, pulling ahead by as many as 12 points in the opening period with the help of a hot 6-of-9 shooting start from three-point range. But the Magic closed the first quarter on a 14-3 run to cut the deficit to one point.\nThe Magic continued its push, beginning the second quarter on a 19-11 run to take a seven-point lead midway through the period before entering halftime with a 69-65 advantage over the Heat. It went down as the highest-scoring first half ever in a game between Miami and Orlando.\nThat scoring pace slowed a bit in the third quarter, as the Heat and Magic combined for 47 points in the period. The Heat won the third quarter 26-21 to enter the fourth quarter with a 91-90 lead before wilting down the stretch.\n“Through three quarters, we put up a good amount of points and we’re doing it in a little bit easier way than we have,” Spoelstra said. “Guys are gaining confidence, the ball was moving great. Even there at the end, though, we got some great looks. This whole thing could look different if two or three of those threes went down. Those were good looks.”\nPowell totaled a team-high 28 points in his Heat regular-season debut, shooting 9 of 19 from the field, 4 of 8 on threes and 6 of 7 from the foul line. He also recorded nine rebounds and four assists.\nThe Magic were led by Franz Wagner and Paolo Banchero, who each scored 24 points. Bane added 23 points for Orlando.\nThe Heat wants to play faster this season and accomplished that Wednesday, playing at a speed of 111.5 possessions per 48 minutes for a pace that would have ranked as the fastest in the NBA last season. This is a drastic shift for the Heat, which has finished as one of the five slowest-paced teams in the NBA in each of the past six regular seasons.\n“I feel like throughout the whole game we played with great pace,” Heat guard Davion Mitchell said. “Honestly, I think that’s what kept us in the game. They’re a lot bigger than us. But we played with a lot of pace, so we tired them out.”\nThe two spots up for grabs in the Heat’s starting lineup went to Mitchell and forward Nikola Jovic in the opener.\nThe three locks for the starting group were center Bam Adebayo, Powell and forward Andrew Wiggins. But there were questions regarding whether Mitchell or Dru Smith would start alongside Powell in the backcourt and whether Jovic or Kel’el Ware would start alongside Adebayo in the frontcourt.\nFor Wednesday’s opener, Mitchell started over Smith in the backcourt and Jovic started over Ware in the frontcourt.\nThe Mitchell-Powell-Wiggins-Jovic-Adebayo lineup was outscored by two points by the Magic in 14 minutes together on Wednesday.\nFour Heat starters finished with double-digit points.\nAlong with Powell’s 28 points, Wiggins finished with 18 points on 6-of-12 shooting from the field, 1-of-5 shooting on threes and 5-of-7 shooting from the foul line, four rebounds and one assist.\nAdebayo totaled 15 points on 4-of-13 shooting from the field 1-of-5 shooting on threes and 6-of-7 shooting from the foul line, 12 rebounds and two assists. He was held scoreless in the fourth quarter despite playing 8:02 in the period.\nMitchell was impressive with 16 points on 7-of-15 shooting from the field and 2-of-6 shooting from three-point range, six rebounds, 12 assists, two steals and one block while committing just one turnover. Mitchell’s 12 assists on Wednesday tied a franchise record for the most assists by a Heat player on opening night, matching the 12 assists that Tim Hardaway had on Nov. 1, 1996.\nBut Jovic struggled at times, as he scored nine points, grabbed three rebounds and committed three turnovers. He was limited to just 1:21 of playing time in the fourth quarter.\nWhenever guard Tyler Herro returns from ankle surgery, he’ll be plugged into the starting group likely in Mitchell’s place. Herro is expected to miss at least the first month of the regular season.\nDesmond Bane #3 of the Orlando Magic looks to pass the ball against Davion Mitchell #45 of the Miami Heat in the first half of the game at Kia Center on October 22, 2025 in Orlando. Julio Aguilar/Getty Images The Heat’s bench provided some quality minutes, especially from forward Jaime Jaquez Jr.\nThe Heat used Jaquez., Simone Fontecchio, Pelle Larsson, Ware and Smith off the bench to complete its 10-man rotation for the opener.\nJaquez was solid, contributing 13 points on 6-of-7 shooting from the field, six rebounds, one assist and two steals in 30 minutes. He was also relied on to play 10:39 in the fourth quarter.\n“He’s earning these minutes because he brings that downhill force of nature aspect that we need,” Spoelstra said of Jaquez. “But defensively, he’s settling in right now.”\nLarsonn’ only stint of the night came in the second quarter, committing two fouls and missing his only field-goal attempt during 3:50 of court time. He never re-entered the game.\nWare was limited to 13:48 of playing time, as Spoelstra staggered his minutes with Adebayo;s. Ware played just 3:58 in the fourth quarter and never played alongside Adebayo.\nWare, who was available Wednesday despite spraining his ankle in practice Tuesday, totaled seven points, four rebounds, one steal and one block in his limited minutes in the opener.\nThe available Heat players who were left out of the rotation on Wednesday were Terry Rozier, Keshad Johnson, and the two-way contract trio of Vlad Goldin, Myron Gardner and Jahmir Young.\nThe only Heat players unavailable for Wednesday’s opener because of injuries were Herro and Kaspras Jakucionis (right groin strain). That left Herro, Jakucionis and Young as the Heat’s three inactives.\nMuch of the talk entering the game on the Heat’s side was the need to grab rebounds against the glass-crashing Magic. But that turned out to be a non-issue for Miami until the fourth quarter.\nAfter two nightmarish rebounding performances this preseason in which the Magic outscored the Heat by a combined margin of 72-34 in second-chance points behind a 45-26 advantage in offensive rebounds in the teams’ two exhibitions, rebounding was a major emphasis for Miami entering the regular-season opener.\nIt started well for the Heat, holding the Magic to just nine second-chance points on four offensive rebounds through the first three quarters on Wednesday.\nBut Orlando came away with nine important second-chance points on five important offensive rebounds in the fourth quarter to spark its late-game comeback. Center Wendell Carter Jr. grabbed four of the Magic’s five offensive rebounds in the fourth quarter.\n“A lot of teams might have size on us, but if we box out and take away their ability to jump — contact negates height,” Powell said. “So we just got to be the more physical, dominant, mentally focused team to go secure those long rebounds and defensive rebounds.”\nSpoelstra opted not to bring in Ware (a 7-footer) to play alongside Adebayo down the stretch to combat the Magic’s rebounding.\n“I had Kel’el out for too long,” Spoelstra said of his decision not to play Ware late in the game. “And we trusted the group that we had out there and the decision-making and all these little nuances. But Kel’el will get there. He’ll get there. We’re going to continue to fast-track him.”\nThe Heat lost another season opener in Orlando.\nWednesday’s game marked the sixth time in the past 10 seasons that the Heat has opened the regular season against the Magic, with five of those games coming in Orlando. For perspective, the last time the Heat opened a season on the road and the game wasn’t in Orlando came in the 2011-12 season when it faced the Mavericks in Dallas on Dec. 25, 2011.\nThe Heat also has dropped most of those season openers against the Magic, as Miami is now 1-5 against Orlando in those six season-opening matchups over the past 10 seasons.\nIn addition, the Heat now lost three games to the Magic in the last three weeks after also losing two exhibitions to Orlando this preseason earlier this month.\nWhile Orlando is expected to be among the Eastern Conference’s top teams this season, it doesn’t get much easier moving forward.\nNot only will the Heat play six of its first eight regular-season games on the road and embark on a West Coast trip next week, but 11 of the Heat’s first 15 games come against opponents that made the playoffs last season.",
