Leonard closed Wednesday's 129-108 loss to the Jazz with 10 points (3-9 FG, 1-5 3Pt, 3-3 FT), four rebounds, two assists, one block and one steal in 29 minutes.\nLeonard struggled from the field in the Clippers opener, managing only 10 points in 29 minutes. All but two of those points came in the third quarter. Like other starters, Leonard did not play in the fourth as the team trailed by 28 after three. He'll look to return to form on Friday when his team hosts the Suns.\nMore News Clippers' Kawhi Leonard: Quiet in season-opening loss 3H ago • by RotoWire Staff Clippers' Kawhi Leonard: Off injury report for Opening Night 1D ago • by RotoWire Staff Clippers' Kawhi Leonard: Resting in preseason finale 7D ago • by RotoWire Staff Clippers' Kawhi Leonard: Leads Clips in scoring Sunday 10D ago • by RotoWire Staff Clippers' Kawhi Leonard: Looks sharp in preseason win 13D ago • by RotoWire Staff Clippers' Kawhi Leonard: Team-high 22 points in Game 7 loss 05/04/2025 • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Basketball Stories 2025-26 NBA Injury Updates Dan Bruno • 5 min read 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings, sleepers, busts Ross Kelly • 5 min read Fantasy hoops awards predictions Joel Bartilotta • 6 min read Fantasy basketball busts JP Aravena • 4 min read 2025-26 Breakouts Jermey Schneider • 5 min read 2025-26 Sleepers Mike Barner • 4 min read",
