Rohit Sharma frustrated after getting out to a pull off Mitchell Starc for 73 in AUS vs IND 2025 2nd ODI Discuss Now Rohit Sharma departed after his 59th ODI fifty. Mitchell Starc took the prized scalp of all-set Rohit Sharma in the second ODI between India and Australia in Adelaide on Thursday, October 23. The left-arm seamer dismissed Rohit for 73 runs off 97 balls. His innings comprised two sixes and seven boundaries.\nAd With the dismissal, Starc also broke the 118-run third-wicket partnership between Rohit and Shreyas Iyer .\nThe dismissal came in the 30th over of India’s innings. Starc bowled a short delivery, and Rohit went for a pull shot. Hazlewood moved towards his right at long leg to complete the catch. The former India captain looked frustrated as he failed to consolidate after a good start, missing out on the triple-figure mark.\nAd Trending Watch the video here (from 11:17 PM IST timestamp) .\nThis was the second consecutive time that Starc dismissed Rohit in the three-match series. He previously removed Rohit, caught behind in the slips for 8 in the series opener.\nNonetheless, Rohit Sharma smashed his 59th half-century in ODIs, his fifth Down Under and 10th against the Aussies. The 38-year-old also completed 150 sixes in SENA countries – 55 sixes in Australia, 48 in England, 31 in New Zealand, and 16 in South Africa.\nAd Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer resurrect India after Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli fall cheaply in the 2nd ODI vs Australia Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer ensured India bounced back after skipper Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli departed for 9 and 0, respectively, in the second ODI against Australia. Apart from Rohit, vice-captain Shreyas Iyer has also completed his half-century.\nAd At the time of writing, the Men in Blue were 143/3 after 31.1 overs, with Iyer (56 off 72) and Axar Patel (2 off 5) at the crease. Xavier Bartlett has been the pick of the bowlers, returning with two wickets in a single over.\nTeam India are trailing 0-1 in the three-match series. They lost the first ODI by seven wickets via the DLS method. A win would keep them alive in the series and set up a series decider in Sydney on Saturday, October 25.\nFollow the AUS vs IND 2025 2nd ODI live score and updates here .\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?
