  "text": "The second ODI against Australia delivered a shocking, unwanted first for Indian cricket as superstar batter Virat Kohli registered successive ducks in the ODI format, falling for a four-ball duck in Adelaide after his first-ever ODI duck Down Under in Perth. This unprecedented slump instantly sent shockwaves through the fan base, raising alarm bells over the batting maestro’s sudden dip in form and his troubles against the new ball.\nWhile the cricketing world debated his technique against Mitchell Marsh‘s Australia, a darker side of the internet swiftly emerged. As has become a reprehensible and shameful pattern, social media trolls mercilessly targeted his wife, actress Anushka Sharma, subjecting her to brutal, baseless abuse and blaming her for his on-field struggles. The unfortunate dismissals reignited the toxic narrative, forcing the couple yet again to confront an onslaught of unwarranted criticism from a cruel section of the online community.\nAUS vs IND, 2nd ODI: Virat Kohli registers historic ducks down under\nThe dual failure of Kohli in the ongoing ODI series against Australia has become a massive talking point, not just for the runs he failed to score but for the unfortunate cricketing history he now holds. The 2nd ODI at the Adelaide Oval saw Kohli depart for a four-ball duck, trapped leg before wicket by the impressive young Australian pacer Xavier Bartlett.\nThis followed his earlier duck in the series opener in Perth, marking the first time in his illustrious ODI career that the batting icon has been dismissed for ducks in successive innings. This sequence of dismissals is exceptionally rare for a player of his calibre, underscoring the momentary lapse in form against a dominant Australian bowling attack. Bartlett, who came into the side in place of Nathan Ellis, proved immediately effective.\nAfter the visitors were reduced to 17/0 in six overs, following the dismissal of Indian captain Shubman Gill, Bartlett tested the former skipper expertly. On the final ball of the over, Kohli was caught plumb in front, a decision he accepted without review, walking off in disappointment.\nDespite these two recent blips, Kohli’s career average stands at a magnificent 57.41 in ODI cricket. In 304 matches, the Indian batter owns a staggering 14,181 runs with a strike rate of 93.27, including a record 51 centuries in the format, demonstrating that the current setback is merely a minuscule anomaly in an otherwise gigantic, flawless career. However, the momentary vulnerability in his game has given critics and trolls a temporary, if misplaced, reason to attack.\nTrolls blame Anushka Sharma for Kohli’s poor form\nIn a disturbing repetition of history, the moment Kohli registered his successive ducks, the focus of toxic social media discourse shifted immediately and unfairly to his wife, Bollywood actress Anushka. This practice of blaming the cricketer’s wife or partner for his poor performance has been a persistent and dark stain on cricket fandom for years. Trolls flooded platforms with vile memes and comments, reviving the misogynistic narrative that Anushka is a ‘bad omen’ or unlucky charm, directly correlating her presence or influence with Kohli’s failure to score.\nThis deeply entrenched pattern ignores the fundamental realities of professional sports, that a player’s performance is dictated by skill, form, and match conditions, not the presence of a family member. High-profile setbacks, like a rare successive duck, seem to act as a trigger for this online abuse, creating a public spectacle where the actress is scapegoated for technical failures on the field. This cruel trolling occurs despite Kohli himself having repeatedly spoken out against such behaviour in the past, publicly defending Anushka and urging fans to show compassion.\nHere’s how fans reacted:\nFangirls and their Anushka destroyed his career. They’ll still defend Anushka. This is so so frustrating man. I can’t even express my anger right now\n— ` (@chixxsays)\n[October 23, 2025]\nIt's very sad that bro has to leave Anushka at home for two weeks to score back to back ducks.\n— 𝐊𝐨𝐡𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭!𝟎𝐧_👑🚩 (@bholination)\n[October 23, 2025]\nI blame anushka sharma for his failure\n[pic.twitter.com/n2EvMx5nV5]— veer (@_veerR____)\n[October 23, 2025]\nHe was in peak in 2020, took a break during the BGT and that’s where downfall began\nIn 2023, after a brilliant year he rested before the Eng series lost his rhythm again\nIn 2025, after a good CT and IPL, he took 5 month break and lost form again\nthe credit goes to Anushka 👍🏻\n[pic.twitter.com/zBWTrvMmkB]— VISHUツ (@Vishuhunyarr)\n[October 23, 2025]\nAnushka Sharma ruined Virat Kohli's cricket career 🤡\nOr Mat Khelo Ind A 🤡\n[pic.twitter.com/C8lKDl72BT]— Honest Cricket Lover (@Honest_Cric_fan)\n[October 23, 2025]\nMan, you shouldn't have married Anushka.
