  "text": "By Robert Marvi ,\n1 hours ago Oct 14, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Los Angeles Lakers guard Austin Reaves (15) against the Phoenix Suns during an NBA preseason game at Mortgage Matchup Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images By Mark J. Rebilas, Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images After falling behind by 10 points in the second quarter of Tuesday's game against the Golden State Warriors, the Los Angeles Lakers fought back and were down by only one point at halftime. But just when it looked like they were in business, they came out in the third quarter looking as flat as a week-old open can of 7 Up.\nThey were outscored 35-25 in that period, and they never recovered, as they lost, 119-109 . While it was only their first game of the new NBA regular season, fans are already very concerned, and some even seem convinced that this will be a long season for the Lakers.\nAfterward, coach JJ Redick publicly pointed out that the team simply wasn't ready to play in the third quarter, which was also a problem it had last season. Austin Reaves, who finished with 26 points and nine assists, said that the problem is with the players and not Redick or Redick's staff.\n“I think ever since I’ve been here, we’ve had a problem with the third quarter. So, just got to figure out a way to come out with a little more energy. First thing JJ talked about after was just figuring out a way to be better in that third quarter. That’s on us players, that’s not on the coaches. They come in here and give us the answers to the test, and we just didn’t come out and execute. So, that’s on us, and we have to be better.”\nLast season, the Lakers were 23rd in third-quarter point differential and 27th in third-quarter scoring. Coming out strong in third quarters, something that Golden State has consistently done over the past decade, is likely more of a mental and emotional thing than it is a physical thing.\nLos Angeles simply needs to adopt the mentality of needing to step on its opponent's neck and immediately put its imprint on the game coming out of halftime.\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Austin Reaves: Lakers' bad third quarters are not JJ Redick's fault",
