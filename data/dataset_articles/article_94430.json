  "text": "Sport\nUCL: Why we lost 5-1 to Chelsea – Ajax manager, Heitinga\nAjax manager, John Heitinga, has claimed their game plan against Chelsea was going well until they were reduced to 10 men.\nHeitinga, however, admitted that the Blues were one of the “better teams” in the Champions League.\nAjax lost 5-1 to Chelsea in their third game in the competition on Wednesday night.\nEnzo Maresca made 10 changes to the team that beat Nottingham Forest in the Premier League at the weekend.\nBut the result was never in doubt after Kenneth Taylor was sent off within the opening 20 minutes.\nMarc Guiu gave the hosts the lead, before Moises Caicedo doubled their advantage.\nWout Weghorst pulled one goal back for Ajax, before Enzo Fernandez and Estevao Willian converted penalties before half-time.\nTyrique George added Chelsea’s fifth after the break.\n“The game plan was working and I think it was hard for them to break the lines. We even had one offensive transition with Mika Godts,” Heitinga told reporters.\n“Then the red card happened and I think they scored two goals from the penalty spot, then two goals were deflected. I cannot blame the players, they were working really hard.”",
