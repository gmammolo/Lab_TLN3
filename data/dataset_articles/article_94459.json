  "text": "The weather was the only thing to slow Stephen F. Austin in beating Nicholls State.\nIn a game that featured two weather delays for a combined four hours, the Lumberjacks scored first and never looked back in defeating Nicholls, 34-7, at Homer Bryce Stadium in Nacogdoches, Texas. The game had a 6 p.m. start time on Saturday but due to the weather delays finished after midnight on Sunday morning.\nIt is the sixth straight loss and the completion of a four-game road swing for Nicholls as the Colonels fall to 1-6 overall and 1-2 in the Southland Conference. The No. 25 Lumberjacks improve to 5-2 overall and 3-0 in conference play.\nThe Lumberjacks scored on their first four possessions to build a 19-0 lead. Field goals from Jacob Hand and Carlos Alvarado were sandwiched around short touchdown runs of 2 and 5 yards by Gavin Rutherford and Jerell Wimbley for the 19-point advantage in the second quarter.\nDuring halftime officials called for the first weather delay that lasted 90 minutes.\nOnce the game resumed, SFA added to its lead when Bugs Mortimer returned a punt 66 yards for a touchdown. The return came at the 10:07 mark of the third quarter making it a 26-0 lead for SFA.\nAt the 6:43 mark of the third quarter officials called for the second weather delay. This delay lasted two-plus hours and when the game eventually restarted the midnight hour was approaching.\nSFA concluded its scoring when Clayton Wayland snagged a 20-yard touchdown reception for a 34-0 lead with 4:07 still in the third quarter.\nNicholls avoided the shutout late in the fourth quarter when quarterback Ean Rodrigue, subbing for starter Deuce Hogan, who did not play after the second weather delay, found Everett Hunter on a 16-yard touchdown pass for the 34-7 final.\nPLAY OF THE GAME\nWhile the outcome of the game was clearly decided, Rodrigue’s scoring pass to Hunter was a shining moment for Nicholls. Rodrigue put the ball where only Hunter could go up and get it. Hunter out jumped a defender, grabbed the ball and fell on the pylon for the score.\nSTARS OF THE GAME\nRodrigue finished the game going 8-of-9 passing for 88 yards and a touchdown. He also rushed for 10 yards on three carries.\nRunning back Shane Lee rushed for 36 yards on 13 carries and had two receptions for 35 yards. Lee’s 33-yard catch and run in the fourth quarter setup Rodrigue's scoring pass to Hunter on the next play.\nDefensive back Laurence Sullivan Jr. blocked an extra point and recovered a fumble, while linebacker Jake Dalmado also recovered a fumble to go with 11 total tackles.\nSafety Ethan Lee returned from injury to lead the Colonels with 14 total tackles, and he stopped a SFA scoring drive with an interception at the goal line in the third quarter.\nNEXT OPPONENT\nAfter playing four straight road games, Nicholls returns to John L. Guidry Stadium to host Southland Conference for McNeese State. Kickoff is slated for 3 p.m. on Sept. 25 and it will be the Hall of Fame and Breast Cancer Awareness Game. The game will be on ESPN Plus and KCIL 96.7 FM.\nNOTES\nSFA leads the all-time series 27-11... SFA out gained Nicholls 372-187 in total yards... SFA punted twice in the game and went 4-of-6 in the red zone... Nicholls went 4-of 16 on third down conversions... Nicholls finished with 11 first downs and 56 yards rushing.",
