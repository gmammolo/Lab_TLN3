  "text": "BEAUMONT, Texas — In the wake of devastating floods that claimed the lives of at least 36 children, grief counselors at Elijah’s Place in Beaumont are offering support and guidance to families struggling with how to talk about loss, especially with their kids.\nAmong the victims was 8-year-old Mary Grace Baker, a student at St. Anne Catholic School in Beaumont. She was attending Camp Mystic in the Hill Country when the flood struck.\n“I cannot begin to imagine the terror that they might have felt at that moment,” said Christian Umana, a counselor at Elijah’s Place. “Because nobody knew what’s going to happen, if they were going to survive.”\nElijah’s Place, a program of Catholic Charities of Southeast Texas, provides grief support for families with children who have experienced the death of a parent or sibling. In light of recent events, the organization is expanding its outreach to help families affected by the Hill Country tragedy.\nProgram Director Randi Fertitta said it’s crucial for parents to let children lead the conversation when discussing traumatic events like the flood.\n“It’s important for parents to first talk to them about what do they know about the event, about what happened to Mary Grace,” Fertitta said.\nShe emphasized that honesty is essential when responding to children’s questions. “By offering them the information they need, it keeps the children from conjuring up their own ideas,” she said.\nFertitta also encouraged parents to be aware of signs of grief in their children, which may include physical complaints, changes in behavior, or trouble sleeping.\nElijah’s Place uses play therapy to help children express emotions they may not have the words to describe. “Play is their language,” said Umana. “Some kids don’t have the ability to comprehend what’s going on with them, so we use play for them to express what they can’t express with language.”\nWhile the nonprofit has reached out to victims' families and local schools to offer help, and is even prepared to host a dedicated support group, so far no one has accepted their offer.\nStill, Umana urged families to seek help if they need it. “You don’t have to deal with this alone. We’re here and we’re open to help you in any way that we can,” he said.\nIf you are looking for help, Fertitta says people can email her at Rfertitta@ccsetx.org or visit their website here.\nIn addition to local resources, an Austin-based organization called Connected Family Partners is hosting a free online webinar to help guide parents and caregivers through difficult conversations with children. The virtual event begins at 9:30 a.m. and will include tips, sample scripts, and a live Q&A session.\nTo register, you can fill out this form.",
