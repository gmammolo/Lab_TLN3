  "text": "\"Remove Shubman Gill\"- Twitter reacts after another poor outing vs Australia\nSai Vaitla\nPublished - 23 Oct 2025, 10:04 AM | Updated - 23 Oct 2025, 10:06 AM\nTeam India skipper Shubman Gill's dismal run with the bat continued as he was dismissed cheaply in the second ODI of the three-match series against Australia. The right-handed batter scored just nine runs before being dismissed in the clash at the Adelaide Oval in Adelaide on Thursday, October 23.\nGill began his ODI captaincy tenure with a seven-wicket loss to Australia in the first ODI at the Optus Stadium in Perth on Sunday. The opening batter scored only 10 runs in the rain-curtailed match. He continued his dismal run in the must-win game against the Australian bowling attack in the ongoing series.\nShubman Gill Dismissed for 9 Runs by Xavier Bartlett\nAustralia skipper Mitchell Marsh won the toss and opted to bowl first in Adelaide. Veteran opener Rohit Sharma survived a massive run-out scare in just the third over of India’s innings. Rohit showed athleticism and dove to make his ground before the ball hit the stumps.\nHowever, India lost their first wicket on the first ball of the seventh over. Shubman Gill, attempting a shot down the ground, mistimed a full delivery from Bartlett and was caught by Mitchell Marsh at mid-off. Gill had to walk back towards the dressing room after scoring 9 runs off 9 balls, including one four.\nFans React as Shubman Gill Departs for a Low Score in 2nd ODI vs Australia\nAur banao all-format captain.

The young batter has scored 299 runs in 10 games at an average of 29.90 and a strike rate of 91.71, including one fifty and one century.\nAfter India’s opening ODI loss to Australia, Gill became only the second captain in Men in Blue history, after Virat Kohli, to lose his first matches across all three international formats.\nGill first led the Indian team in T20Is on July 6, 2024, against Zimbabwe at Harare Sports Club, where India fell short by 13 runs. The Men in Blue also lost a Test match on Gill’s captaincy debut. They failed to defend a target of 371 and lost by five wickets against England at Headingley, Leeds.\nThe Indian opener has played 57 ODIs, amassing 2,794 runs at an outstanding average of 57.02 and a strike rate of 99.28. He has smashed eight centuries and 15 fifties, with a best score of 208 against New Zealand.\nAlso read: BCCI issues official statement on Sarfaraz Khan after India A snub\nAbout the Author\nSai Vaitla is an author at Cricketaddictor and he has been working since September 2022.\nSai Vaitla...\nRead more",
