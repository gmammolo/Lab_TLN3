  "text": "\"Virat Kohli's favorite animal is a duck\"- Twitter reacts to another flop show vs Australia\nMukesh Singh\nPublished - 23 Oct 2025, 10:06 AM | Updated - 23 Oct 2025, 10:10 AM\nVirat Kohli's horror tour of Australia continued on Thursday (October 23) as the right-handed batsman failed to get going with the bat in the ongoing second ODI.\nThe ongoing three-match series marked his return to international cricket after a long time. Virat Kohli's last international assignment was the Champions Trophy in March this year.\nLack of game time exposing Indian legends\nHe was expected to be a part of the Test team for the tour of England in June, but decided to bring down the curtains on his illustrious career in red-ball cricket.\nAlso Read: India loses 17th consecutive toss!! Ravi Shastri flabbergasted at Shubman Gill's luck\nUnsurprisingly, there was a lot of hype surrounding Kohli's return for the ongoing series. However, the former India skipper has failed to live up to the expectations. In fact, he has endured a disastrous tour so far as he failed to open his account in any of the first two matches.\nIn the first match in Perth, he was out for an 8-ball duck. After Mitchell Starc bowled a pitched up delivery outside the off stump, Kohli chased the ball for a drive away from his body and ended up edging the ball to the fielder at backward point.\nVirat Kohli flops again\nKohli had to come out to bat early in the second ODI as well. He walked out to bat in the 7th over after Xavier Bartlett dismissed India captain Shubman Gill for 9 runs on the first ball of the over. Four balls later, the Australia pacer sent back Virat as well to put his team in the driver's seat.\nIt was a nip-backer from Bartlett and Kohli was completely beaten by it. He wanted to flick the ball but was beaten by it as the ball hit him on the pad and the umpire wasted little time in raising his finger.\nVIRAT KOHLI GONE FOR HIS SECOND DUCK OF THE SERIES!\n— cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau)[#AUSvIND]|[#PlayoftheDay]|[@BKTtires][pic.twitter.com/jqIdvMeX9T][October 23, 2025]\nTwitter reacts to yet another flop show\nAs Kohli departed for a duck once again, the fans on social media were quick to have some fun at his expense. Here are some of the reactions:\nVIRAT KOHLI REGISTERED BACK TO BACK DUCKS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ODI CRICKET. 🤯\n— Mufaddal Vohra (@mufaddal_vohra)[pic.twitter.com/D7eoTC8wcv][October 23, 2025]\nKohli might've sold his Int'l career to the devil for that IPL trophy\n— soo washed (@anubhav__tweets)[October 23, 2025]\nGambhir, Agarkar watching Kohli scored back to back Ducks...\n— TukTuk Academy (@TukTuk_Academy)[pic.twitter.com/EN4TO3Rvoq][October 23, 2025]\nIt’s a bit sad to see how hard Rohit Sharma & Kohli are trying to prolong their Cricketing careers in this consolation series. Almost hostile management, already convinced these two are spent forces. The youngsters like Abhishek sharma/Jaiswal are itching to come in.
