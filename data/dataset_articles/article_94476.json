  "text": "A year ago, the Celtics opened their season with a celebration. Banner 18 was raised to the TD Garden rafters, sparkling championship rings were handed out, the quest to do it all again began.\nThat goal was not achieved, of course. And on Wednesday night, the Celtics opened a new season in which expectations are as low as they have been in a decade.\nAlthough they showed signs of promise, their shortcomings were probably more glaring, as they coughed up a 13-point fourth-quarter lead and lost to the 76ers, 117-116, when Payton Pritchard’s potential game-winner from the left baseline slid off the rim.\n“It’s a game we should’ve had,” Pritchard said, “so, it’s a learning experience.”\nThere figure to be plenty more that follow. The Celtics will play most if not all of this season without injured superstar Jayson Tatum, who watched this game from the bench in street clothes and took selfies with some fans during a second-half timeout.\nFor years, the Celtics have turned to Tatum during crunch time. It did not always work out, but it provided a sense of stability. The Celtics appeared unsettled as they tried to navigate the tense final minutes with a less obvious hierarchy.\nAdvertisement\nThe Celtics led, 109-100, with 3:47 left, but went 3 for 11 with two turnovers over the remainder of the game.\n“I feel like the last couple years, we knew exactly what we were trying to get to,” said guard Derrick White. “So, it’s going to be a little bit different this year.”\nWhite and Jaylen Brown had 25 points apiece to lead the Celtics, who made just 11 of 43 3-pointers as a team.\nThe Celtics improbably had a chance to win in the final seconds after 76ers rookie VJ Edgecombe, who was otherwise spectacular in his 34-point debut, missed two free throws with his team leading by a point.\nWhite was inbounding the ball from the sideline and looking for a cutting Jaylen Brown, but when that option was covered, he found Pritchard. The reigning Sixth Man of the Year carved into the paint before being enveloped by several defenders. He had Anfernee Simons and Sam Hauser open beyond the left arc, but instead flipped up an awkward, contested layup that hit the bottom of the rim.\nAdvertisement\nHe said the Celtics went over film of that play once they got back to the locker room following this loss.\n“I made the wrong read,” Pritchard said. “I thought I could get him in the air and draw a foul there, but the right read was a little kick-out to Anfernee. So, it’s a growing process.”\n76ers guard Tyrese Maxey (No. 0), dribbling around Celtics guard Payton Pritchard, led Philadelphia with 40 points in a 117-116 victory at TD Garden. Danielle Parhizkaran/Globe Staff The ball caromed out of bounds off the 76ers with 1.6 seconds left. The Celtics were out of timeouts, and when Pritchard caught the inbounds pass on the left baseline, he knew there was no time to make a read. He double-clutched and watched his 13-footer sail long.\nIf that shot had happened to go in, the postgame discussion would have focused on how this rebuilt roster eked out a gritty win against a pretty good team, potentially a promising sign of what is to come.\nIt missed, and the spotlight shined on the shortcomings. There was the 76ers’ 42-point fourth quarter. There were rebounding issues. There was the Celtics inability to stop Tyrese Maxey (40 points) and Edgecombe. Boston dared the rookie to hit 3-pointers, and he made five.\n“I don’t know if it was too focused on the offensive end,” Brown said, “but we can’t just let guys come here and just do what they want.”\nThe Celtics said throughout training camp that they intend to be disruptive by playing fast and swarming opponents. After the 76ers’ fourth-quarter eruption, Brown wondered whether the pace of play caught up with the Celtics by the end.\nThe Celtics seized control with a 21-4 third-quarter run and led, 88-75, with 11 minutes left in the fourth. But three consecutive Maxey 3-pointers brought the 76ers to life, and a driving layup by Edgecombe with 7:56 left capped a 17-6 run that pulled them within 94-92.\nAdvertisement",
