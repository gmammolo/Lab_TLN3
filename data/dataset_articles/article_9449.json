  "text": "GRANDFATHER MOUNTAIN — Rescue personnel recently rescued multiple hikers in separate incidents.\nOn the afternoon of June 17, Linville-Central Rescue and NC Mountain Rescue Team 1 were alerted to a report of an injured hiker near Calloway Peak, below the Attic Window section of the Grandfather Trail in Grandfather Mountain State Park.\nResponding agencies included Linville Volunteer Fire Department, Avery County Fire Marshal/Emergency Management, Avery EMS, Banner Elk Volunteer Fire & Rescue, Grandfather Mountain State Park staff, and Grandfather Mountain Stewardship Foundation. More than 26 mostly volunteer rescuers responded, either assisting with the operation of a trailhead command center or hiking up more than 800 vertical feet on the rugged Grandfather and Underwood Trails.\nAfter access and patient assessment it was decided a helicopter evacuation would be the best course of action. Emergency Management requested a team from SC HART (Helicopter Aquatic Rescue Team) to respond to a hoist operation. Using a small 15-minute window of clear weather amid afternoon storm cells, a successful hoist of the patient was completed by both SC HART technicians and ground-based Mountain Rescue Team members. The SC HART team landed at a nearby landing zone set up by other first responders, and the patient was unloaded and transported to a medical center. Many thanks to all the volunteers and paid personnel who responded to help this person in their time of need.\nOn Sunday afternoon, June 22, Linville Central Rescue was requested to assist Caldwell County with an injured hiker on the Daniel Boone Scout Trail on Grandfather Mountain. Personnel responded with members of the Blowing Rock Fire Department. The subject was located and assessed and Caldwell Emergency Management decided the best course of action was to activate NC HART. The injured hiker was safely evacuated, and all rescuers made their way out of the woods to the command post shortly after 9 p.m.\nAgencies on this call included Linville-Central Rescue Squad, NC Mountain Rescue Team 1, Linville Volunteer Fire Department, Grandfather Mountain State Park, Blowing Rock Fire Department, NC Emergency Management, NC HART and Caldwell County Emergency Management.\nEarly on June 23, Burke County Emergency Management was notified of an injured hiker along the Conley Cove Trail. A swift and coordinated response was initiated involving Burke EMS, Burke EMS Special Operations, Burke Rescue, Oak Hill Fire Rescue, and Linville Central Rescue. A total of 17 personnel participated in the rescue operation.\nThe hiker, who sustained a lower extremity injury, received immediate medical attention on-site. Rescue teams carefully assisted the individual along the trail back to the Conley Cove Trailhead, navigating challenging terrain over a six-hour operation. The patient was then transported to a nearby hospital for further medical evaluation and care.\nLinville Central offers the following suggestions for safely hiking and recreating in the area:\n- Call or text 911 if you are lost, sustained traumatic injuries from a fall, or experiencing a medical emergency.\n- If you find your way out or your situation changes, call 911 again to update rescuers.\n- Hike with at least one other companion.\n- Always tell someone your intended travel plans and return time.\n- Pack extra food and plenty of water.\n- Assume the weather will change — bring sun protection, rain gear, and extra layers for sudden cold.\n- Bring a cell phone charging battery pack.\n- Bring multiple headlamps in case your activity takes longer than planned.\n- Make sure everyone is wearing appropriate footwear for traction and to help avoid ankle injuries.\n- Collect all your trash. Leave a trail more pristine than you found it.\nIn June, the Linville-Central Mountain Rescue Team has been a part of the ground-base team assisting with four helicopter hoist rescues of injured hikersin the area.",
