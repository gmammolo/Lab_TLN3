  "text": "Field Hockey Loses 2-0 Decision to No. 8 Assumption, Cameron Records 34 Saves\nThe Saint Michael's College field hockey team fell to No. 8 Assumption University, losing 2-0 in a Northeast 10 Conference match. Senior goalie Joelle Cameron made 34 saves, a remarkable performance that kept the game competitive but ultimately couldn't secure a victory for her team, which drops to 1-14 this season. Assumption, now on an eight-game winning streak, scored both goals in the first half and was held scoreless afterward. Despite the loss, Cameron's performance marked a significant achievement, bringing her season total to 380 saves, ranking her 12th in NCAA history.\n- Saint Michael's College: 1-14 overall, 1-8 in NE10\n- Assumption University: 10-5 overall, 9-1 in NE10\n- Joelle Cameron's 34 saves marks her 380 saves this season, ranking 12th in NCAA history.\n- Assumption extended its winning streak to eight games.\n- Cameron turned away the final 18 shots from Assumption after the second goal.\nSaint Michael's will look to bounce back as they face Pace University on Saturday at 1 p.m. The team aims to leverage the strong performance from Cameron to secure their second win of the season.\nBottom LineThe loss underscores the ongoing struggles for Saint Michael's, but Cameron's outstanding performance highlights her potential as a key player for the remainder of the season. The team needs to focus on building on this effort moving forward.\nRead more at Saint Michael's College\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
