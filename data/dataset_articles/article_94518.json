  "text": "To news overview© XPBimages\nThe 2016 Mexican Grand Prix is remembered not for Lewis Hamilton's victory, but for Sebastian Vettel's outburst over team radio in which he targeted frustrations with officiating and aggressive defending.\nAs the race reached its climax, Vettel was in a fierce battle with Max Verstappen for third place, escalating spectacularly when Verstappen cut the first corner chicane while defending his position.\nVettel, in the Ferrari, saw this as a clear advantage gained by leaving the track.\nThe tension rose with a miscommunication between teams. Ferrari informed Vettel that Verstappen was instructed to concede position, but this was inaccurate. Red Bull had suggested Verstappen consider it; ultimately, they told him to \"stay there.\"\nWith Verstappen still ahead, Vettel's patience evaporated. He unleashed an expletive-laden radio tirade. \"Move!\" he shouted. \"He's a bastard.\"\nVettel's anger peaked when targeting race director Charlie Whiting. Upon hearing \"Charlie said...\" Vettel infamously responded: \"Yeah? Here's a message for Charlie: Fuck off! Honestly!\"\nFerrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene intervened, telling Vettel to calm down, to which Vettel replied, \"OK, copy Maurizio.\"\nIronically, Vettel's situation worsened post-race. Though initially promoted to third following Verstappen's penalty, the stewards reviewed Vettel's defensive moves against Daniel Ricciardo and demoted him to fifth for moving under braking, making his radio outbust appear more misguided.\nVerstappen was scathing, calling Vettel \"a very frustrated guy\" who needed to \"go back to school\" for his radio outbursts.\nRecognising the severity of his actions, Vettel sought Whiting post-podium to apologise.\nThe FIA decided against disciplinary action on the basis of \"exceptional circumstances\" but warned any future incidents would go before the International Tribunal.\nAlso interesting:\nJoin RacingNews365's Ian Parkes, Sam Coop and Nick Golding, as they look back on the US GP and look ahead to this weekend's race in Mexico City. Max Verstappen being a serious threat for McLaren is the lead discussion, after his perfect performance.\nRather watch the podcast? Then click here!\nJoin the conversation!",
