  "text": "Governor Nasir Idris of Kebbi State has ordered the immediate reconstruction of the Makera-Kangiwa road linking the state to neighbouring Niger State after it was washed away by recent flooding.\nThe governor issued the directive on Wednesday during an inspection of the damaged section of the road in Makera, describing it as a strategic economic route vital for local and cross-border connectivity.\nA statement by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Ahmed Idris, on Thursday noted that the governor emphasised the road’s importance to surrounding communities and regional trade with neighbouring countries.\n“Governor Idris emphasised its importance not only to local mobility but also to cross-border trade with neighbouring countries.\n“He tasked the Ministry of Works to identify and engage a competent contractor to execute the reconstruction without delay.\n“This administration will not rest until critical infrastructure across the state is restored and expanded.\n“Our people deserve the dividends of democracy, and we are committed to delivering just that,” the governor was quoted as saying.\nAlso Read: Also speaking during the visit, the Commissioner for Works, Alhaji Abdullahi Umar-Muslim, assured residents that the ministry had begun evaluating qualified contractors for the project.\n“We understand the hardship this has caused, and we are moving swiftly to resolve it. His Excellency’s directive is clear—no delays, no excuses,” Umar-Muslim added.",
