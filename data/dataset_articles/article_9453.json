  "text": "An investigation is underway Thursday after Los Angeles Fire Department rescue crews freed 31 workers trapped in Wilmington after a 18-foot tunnel collapsed.\nMore than 100 firefighters — including Urban Search and Rescue team members specially trained and certified to handle confined-space tunnel operations — were dispatched to the 1700 block of North Figueroa Street shortly before 8 p.m Wednesday, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.\nThe 31 workers, who were boring a tunnel for the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts at the time of the collapse, were rescued with no visible injuries at around 9:45 p.m. Wednesday.\nThey managed to climb over a pile of loose soil, estimated to be 12 to 15 feet tall, with considerable effort, said Brian Humphrey, a spokesman with the LAFD.\nThey were able to reach several coworkers on the other side of the collapse and were taken in groups by a tunnel vehicle to the entry point, which is more than five miles away.\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said when she heard about the collapse, she expected to find “tragedy- but instead, we found victory.”\nIt was unclear what caused the tunnel to collapse.\nTwenty-seven workers removed from the tunnel are being medically evaluated by LAFD paramedics at the scene, Humphrey said.\n“When I heard about this partial collapse, I rushed over fearing the worst,” Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn, whose Fourth District, includes Wilmington, said on social media. “But we are so blessed tonight that all these men made it out safely”\nHahn is also a member of the sanitation districts’ Board of Directors.\n“LAFD has just reported that all workers who were trapped in the tunnel in Wilmington are now out and accounted for,” Bass added. “I just spoke with many of the workers who were trapped. Thank you to all of our brave first responders who acted immediately. You are L.A.’s true heroes.”\nThe 18-foot diameter excavation site was under construction for municipal wastewater management, which will serve five million people in the Los Angeles Basin, NBC4 reported.\n“Tonight, I am in Wilmington with Mayor Bass, L.A. Police Chief McDonnell and L.A. Fire Chief [Ronnie] VIllanueva and multiple emergency staff at the site of the Clearwater Project after reports of a tunnel collapse with multiple personnel in the tunnel,” .said Councilman Tim McOsker, who also represents Wilmington. “I am relieved to report that all 31 individuals working the shift have been accounted for are safe. I am grateful for the rapid response of our L.A. City Fire Department, which deployed over 100 personnel, including the Urban Search and Rescue teams.”\nThe incident commander requested that helicopters from television stations be no closer than one mile from the intersection of Figueroa Street and Lomita Boulevard because excessive noise from the helicopters above the rescue site was interfering with the ability of rescue personnel to effectively communicate face-to-face or via radio at ground level.\nNBC 4 reported the sanitation project was slated to be completed by the end of the year, but Michael Chee, a spokesman with Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, said all construction on the tunnel will be halted pending an investigation.",
