  "text": "After going into the market to bolster their striking department, Kaizer Chiefs are struggling in the same area they spent so much effort trying to improve.\nThe Soweto giants brought in Flavio da Silva, Etiosa Ighodaro, and Khanyisa Mayo as strikers this season, after scoring 25 goals in the Betway Premiership last season. Just nine matches into the new campaign, not much has changed up front for Amakhosi.\nREAD: 'Serious Move' Possible For Mfundo Vilakazi\nThey played out to a goalless draw with Siwelele FC at FNB Stadium on Wednesday evening, extending their winless run in the Premiership to four matches.\nThe Soweto giants have scored just eight goals in nine matches, having the second-worst scoring record of the teams currently in the top eight.\nOnly Polokwane City have scored fewer goals than Chiefs in the top eight, showing how much Amakhosi are struggling in the final third at the moment.\nChiefs have only scored more than one goal in a game once this season, against Stellenbosch FC in the opening match of the campaign. Since then, they've mostly been scoring just one goal. They've only failed to score on two occasions, in the goalless draws with Siwelele and Mamelodi Sundowns.\nIt's not any different in the knockout competitions. They played out to a goalless draw with Stellenbosch in the Carling Knockout last season before being booted out via a penalty shootout. In the CAF Champions League, they've scored one goal in three matches thus far.\nSilva is the club's top scorer with two goals, but has not featured in the matchday squad recently. The likes of Ashley du Preez, Wandile Duba, and Tashreeq Morris seem to be low in confidence right now, as they are not contributing with goals for the club.\nREAD: Makaab: What Mbule Had To Understand\nDu Preez missed a sitter in the Champions League clash against AS Simba last weekend and, had he scored, Amakhosi would have been in a more comfortable position going into the second leg at home this weekend.\nThis is an issue co-coaches Khalil Ben Youssef and Cedric Kaze will have to address, or else they will find themselves under immense pressure in the coming weeks.",
