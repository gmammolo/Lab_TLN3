  "text": "Youth League: AS Monaco fall in the last quarter of an hour against Tottenham\nIt was a match that was long in the balance but unfortunately turned against them. After a goal-filled encounter, the Rouge et Blanc, who hosted Tottenham at the Performance Centre for the third matchday of the Youth League, finally faltered in the last quarter of an hour, despite a convincing and close first half (2-4). ✍️\nA strong first half\nThe Rouge et Blanc kicked off under beautiful sunshine at the Performance Center. From the opening minutes, Djimi Traoré’s players pushed forward, and Joan Tincres shot into the side netting (1′). The match was very competitive, and Jules Stawiecki saved Thompson’s effort (9′).\nOn the counterattack, the Monaco number 9 found himself in front of the opposing goalkeeper but missed the target (10′). The Spurs countered and opened the scoring through Irow, after a fine team move (14′, 0-1).\nThe Tincres-Haddani duo shines\nThe Rouge et Blanc responded immediately, but Nahël Haddani unfortunately missed the target (17′). Joan Tincres, on the other hand, was perfectly set up by his attacking partner and managed to equalize after a fine display in the box (27′, 1-1).\nBefore half-time, the number 11, once again, provided a perfect pass to Kenan Moulangou, who was denied by the Londoners’ goalkeeper (36). The Rouge et Blanc finished the first half better, but the two teams went into the locker room with the score tied at 1-1.\nC'est la pause au Centre de Performance, les deux équipes sont dos à dos ⚔️\n— AS Monaco 🇲🇨 (@AS_Monaco)\n[October 22, 2025]\nTincres hits a double\nThe second half started in the same way and on a great pass from Nick Mokabakila, Joan Tincres did it again and headed the ball home to secure a brace (46th, 2-1). Following on from this, Nahël Haddani found the Spurs goalkeeper’s gloves (49′). The English recovered and Irow came up against a great Jules Stawiecki (54′ and 56′), before Upson equalized with a header from a corner (58′, 2-2).\nSpurs take the lead again\nThe match was indecisive, and on a counterattack, the Londoners quickly launched their attack through their number 9, who once again stumbled against the last Monaco defender, who were clearly having a great day (65′). The French U19 international, however, was powerless against Thompson (74′, 2-3). Reduced to ten men after a second yellow card for Kenan Moulangou (75′), the Rouge et Blanc were then saved twice by their goalkeeper (81′).\nLooking ahead to the trip to Bodø/Glimt\nUnfortunately, from a corner, Black allowed Tottenham to take the lead with a powerful half-volley (82′, 2-4). Monaco attempted to respond late in the game through substitute Chaihane Badoro, who saw his 20-meter shot saved by Archer (89′). AS Monaco thus lost 4-2 to Tottenham on Matchday 3 of the Youth League. The next match in the competition is Tuesday, November 4th (2 p.m.)., in Bodø/Glimt.\nC'est terminé 🏁\nLes jeunes Monégasques s'inclinent face à Tottenham.\n— AS Monaco 🇲🇨 (@AS_Monaco)\n[October 22, 2025]\n🗓️ Match details:\nWednesday, October 22 – Performance Center\nUEFA Youth League: AS Monaco 2-4 Tottenham Hotspur\nHalf-time: 1-1\nGoals: Tincres (27′, 46′) for AS Monaco; Irow (14′), Upson (58′), Thompson (74′), and Black (82′) for Tottenham\nBookings: Moulangou (33′ and 75′), Tincres (45′), Drame (70′) for AS Monaco; Olusesi (60′), Williams-Barnett (88′) for Tottenham\nSendings off: Moulangou (75′) for AS Monaco\nAS Monaco: Stawiecki – Dzabatou Ecko, Bein, Leunga Leunga (Badoro 84′), Drama, Mokabakila, – Wamu, Ajroud (Sylla 66′), Mouh (Moulangou, 23′) – Haddani (Konate 66′), Tincres (Dodo 66′)\nSubstitutes: iamuna Lubaki, Guerchi, El Ouaroudi, Moulangou, Badoro, Sylla, Balliana, Konate, Dodo\nCoach: Djimi Traoré\nTottenham Hotspur: Archer – Roswell (Tingey 91′), Hardy, Upson, Byrne – Black (Hall 91′), Olusesi ©, Williams-Barnett (Beggs 91′) – Thompson, Irow, Adewole (Elliott-Parris 66′)\nSubstitutes: Thompson, Irow, Beggs, Elliott-Parris, Tingey, Bangura, Myrtaj, Hall, Boast\nCoach: Wayne Burnett",
