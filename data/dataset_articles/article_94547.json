  "text": "Is one of the most illustrious careers in Indian cricket history coming to an end? Almost as a farewell, Virat Kohli raised his right hand and waved to the spectators after registering consecutive ducks for the first time in his ODI career. He made Adelaide Oval his stronghold. At this venue, he has amassed the highest number of runs (975) by any visiting batter (in all formats). Although the cheers did not match the enthusiastic response he received when he stepped out to bat, he did receive an ovation, and Kohli, in a move that may seem out of character, acknowledged it by waving good-bye.

Or did it have a more profound meaning, such as an ODI retirement? It goes without saying that social media was ablaze. Additionally, it discussed Kohli's swift wave to the Adelaide crowd more than his back-to-back ducks.

In the series opener at the Optus Stadium in Perth on Sunday (October 19), Kohli, who is now retired from T20Is and Tests, was bowled for a painful eight-ball duck. This was his first series after a seven-month layoff. With the angle of left-armer Mitchell Starc, it was another delivery that was heading away from him. Kohli tried to force things by pushing hard with his hands after failing to get off the mark in seven balls. The ball caught the outside half of his bat, bounced a little more than he anticipated, and soared to backward point, where the fielder made no mistake.

After producing a few back-of-a-length deliveries, he began to get closer to the stumps and go a little fuller before bowling what could be called the fullest ball of his spell, which caught Kohli plumb in front. Even though he is incredibly strong off his pads, Kohli was unable to make contact. Without hesitation, the umpire lifted his finger. After speaking with Rohit Sharma for a little while, Kohli decided against taking a review and it turned out to be a right call as the ball tracker showed that it would strike the middle of the middle-stump.\",",
