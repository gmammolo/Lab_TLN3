  "text": "Two local media station groups are teaming up to help those affected by the deadly floods that swept through Central Texas and the Hill Country.\nGraham Media Group and Gray Media have launched an urgent donation drive supporting local relief and recovery efforts. The two promise that 100% of the funds raised will support on-the-ground efforts in flood-affected regions.\nThe July 4 floods uprooted families, destroyed homes, and left entire communities reeling. While recovery will take time, there is a critical need for shelter, supplies, and support. The campaign raised more than $120,000 in donations in its first 24 hours, including a $25,000 donation from Gray. Graham Media Group is making an additional $15,000 donation to the campaign.\nThrough this collaborative campaign, Graham Media Group’s KSAT in San Antonio and KPRC in Houston and Gray stations across 113 markets in the US aim to generate donations that deliver vital resources, including food, housing, and financial aid, to impacted communities.\n“Graham Media Group is proud to partner with Gray in supporting the Salvation Army’s critical emergency disaster response in Texas,” said Catherine Badalamente, CEO of Graham Media Group. “As broadcasters, we have a responsibility to not only inform our communities about breaking news but to help them in times of crisis. The Salvation Army’s rapid response teams are providing essential services to flood victims, and we’re honored to contribute to these life-saving relief efforts during this devastating time.”\n“Gray is committed to serving the affected communities for as long it takes and we are honored to partner with Graham Media Group and The Salvation Army on this important effort,” said Pat LaPlatney, Gray Co-CEO and president. “We are grateful to viewers for what has already been a generous response to this call for assistance.”\nThe Salvation Army Emergency Disaster Services teams are currently on the ground providing meals, hydration, and emotional and spiritual care, but more help is needed.\nYou can donate today at www.togetherfortx.com",
