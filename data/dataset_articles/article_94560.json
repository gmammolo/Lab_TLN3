  "text": "FIFA tournament featuring Afghan women's refugee team relocated to Morocco from UAE\nSign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox\nFollow topic:\nA FIFA-organised tournament involving the Afghanistan women's refugee team has been moved from the United Arab Emirates to Morocco, the world soccer governing body said, with the four-team friendly competition set to begin on Sunday.\nThe \"FIFA Unites: Women's Series\" tournament, originally scheduled to run from October 23-29 in Dubai, also features the national women's teams of the UAE, Chad and Libya.\nThe Afghanistan women's refugee team's creation stems from the Taliban's ban on women's sports following their takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, prompting players to flee the country fearing persecution.\n\"FIFA would like to thank the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FMRF) and looks forward to working together to host a successful tournament,\" FIFA said in a statement.\nThe governing body also confirmed that the Afghanistan women's refugee team has chosen a new official name, \"Afghan Women United,\" following consultation with FIFA.\nPrior to the Taliban's takeover, Afghanistan had 25 women players under contract, most of whom now live in Australia. Afghanistan's men's team continues as normal. REUTERS",
