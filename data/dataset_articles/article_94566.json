  "text": "Possible Wessels ban has Rassie fuming\nNEWS: Another Springbok is in hot water and could face a lengthy ban despite no video evidence of any wrongdoing, prompting Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus to fire shots at officials on social media.\nFollowing hot on the heels of the five-match ban to Sharks wing Makazole Mapimpi, Bulls utility forward Jan-Hendrik Wessels is awaiting the outcome of a hearing that took place on Sunday following an incident involving Connacht flank Josh Murphy.\nSpeculation was rife in media circles on Wednesday that the Bulls hooker has been handed a nine-match suspension, but the United Rugby Championship has not made any official statement on the matter.\nThe incident occurred in the 18th minute of the game between Connacht and the Bulls in the United Rugby Championship.\nMurphy and Wessels became entangled at the breakdown. As they went to ground, Murphy lashed out twice, prompting referee Mike Adamson, who was standing directly in front of them, to blow his whistle.\nMurphy accused Wessels of testicle grabbing, but there was no conclusive evidence for the match officials to review.\nDeliberation with TMO Hollie Davidson did not yield any confirmation of the alleged claim.\nAdamson then issued a 20-minute red card to Murphy, with Wessels remaining on the field.\nWith the limited footage available, the question is whether the disciplinary committee will rule against the 24-year-old Wessels by simply accepting the accusation of an opposing player.\nFollowing the rumours of the ‘ban’, Erasmus made a comment on the social platform X early on Thursday morning, lambasting officials in South African slang meaning “Go, man!” or “Get out of here, man!”.\nIt just got tougher !! We now have to beat them on the field. and in the boardrooms. Hamba man. Tsek. Loop Kak\n— Johan Erasmus (@RassieRugby)\n[October 23, 2025]\nFormer Irish referee boss Owen Doyle has also slammed Adamson for the way he handled the incident\nThe Bulls are allegedly expected to appeal the ruling once it has been confirmed.\nWin 4 tickets to watch the Springboks vs Japan on Saturday, 1st November 2025 at 16:10 at Wembley Stadium.
