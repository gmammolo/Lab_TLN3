  "text": "The second ODI in Adelaide has brought to light some serious weak spots in Team India’s lineup. It also exposed the poor batting form of two of India’s biggest stars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.\nKohli and Rohit Struggle Again\nRohit Sharma’s struggle for runs continued, as he played at an unusually slow pace, with a strike rate more suited for Test cricket.\nVirat Kohli, on the other hand, lasted just four balls before being dismissed for a duck another disappointing outing for the veteran.\nLegends Facing the Inevitable Decline\nBoth Kohli and Rohit have served Indian cricket with distinction for years. But their recent performances suggest that their best days may be behind them.\nTheir technique and body language now seem a far cry from the confident, dominant pair they once were.\nFans who tuned in hoping for a comeback after the Perth ODI were left heartbroken. Instead of redemption, they saw a continuation of the same struggles a reflection of the Ro-Ko duo’s fading sharpness at the international level.\nTime to Pass the Baton?\nMany now believe it’s time for both to make a graceful exit from ODI cricket. By holding on, they risk overshadowing the glorious legacy they have built over the years.\nRetirement, made on their own terms, could open doors for India’s next generation of batters waiting for a chance.\nThe Reality Every Player Must Face\nNo matter how great a cricketer once was, age and lack of form eventually take their toll.\nIt’s never easy for legends to step aside, but sometimes doing so at the right time preserves respect and avoids unnecessary public scrutiny.",
