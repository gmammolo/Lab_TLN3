  "text": "India’s top order faltered again in the second ODI against Australia at the Adelaide Oval. Asked to bat first, the team was in early trouble after captain Shubman Gill fell cheaply, leaving India under pressure within the first few overs.\nBartlett Strikes Early for Australia\nMitchell Marsh’s call to bowl first worked perfectly. Xavier Bartlett, continuing his impressive run with the new ball, dismissed Gill for 9 off 9 in his second over.\nGill tried to drive straight but mistimed it, offering a simple catch to Marsh at mid-off, who completed it with a diving effort.\nAt that point, India were 17/1 in 6.4 overs. Rohit Sharma was batting on 8 off 28 balls, playing cautiously as Australia maintained tight lines and sharp discipline. The run rate hovered around 2.55, showing India’s conservative start.\nTight Bowling Keeps India in Check\nBartlett’s opening spell was all about control 1.4 overs, 3 runs, 1 wicket, with an economy of 1.80. Josh Hazlewood backed him perfectly, conceding just 3 runs in his 3 overs.\nBoth bowlers exploited the early movement in Adelaide, bowling consistently in the corridor outside off and making life difficult for the Indian batters. The surface offered swing and bounce, keeping the pacers interested throughout the spell.\nFans Question Gill’s Form and Team Selection\nGill’s early dismissal has again sparked debate over Gautam Gambhir’s team selections. The skipper has looked out of form in recent outings, and fans on social media have not held back their criticism.\nOne user wrote, “Aur banao all-format captain. Dragged Shubman Gill unnecessarily into the T20 side, had a flop Asia Cup, and now struggling in his best format too.”\nAnother commented, “It’s time to bring in Yashasvi Jaiswal for the 3rd ODI. Rohit deserves a better opening partner.”\nIndia Need a Fightback\nWith Gill gone early, India’s hopes now rest on Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer. The pair must stabilise the innings, build a solid partnership, and set a platform for the middle order to accelerate later in the innings.\nAll eyes are on Rohit and Iyer to script a comeback and put India back on track in this must-win encounter.",
