  "text": "- Opinion\nSportMotorsport\nI'm a female F1 fan. This awkward TV moment truly disappointed me\nEmily Patterson\nFemale representation is a challenge that Formula 1 has grappled with forever.\nHistorically, women's voices have been rarely heard and significantly underrepresented in the sport, with a profound lack of women in high-profile roles, particularly as drivers, lead broadcasters, and within management ranks.\nNow, a clip from Sky Sport F1's broadcast of the US Grand Prix is doing the rounds online, and as a female motorsport fan and sports journalist, I'm not impressed by the behaviour, and the online reaction has been equally disappointing.\nREAD MORE: Star duo stand up with 180-run stand to rescue Aussies\nREAD MORE: Chalmers caught up in 'fabricated quotes' drama\nREAD MORE: 'Ill-fated' Dragons stint over as Ilias finds new home\nThe clip in question shows former world champion Jenson Button make a face at the camera as fellow pundit and ex-IndyCar and NASCAR driver Danica Patrick speaks.\nThe moment was captured while the pair was reacting to the collision between Williams' Carlos Sainz and Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli during the US Grand Prix.\nOn lap six, Sainz made contact with Antonelli during a botched overtaking move at Turn 15. As a result of the incident, Sainz was forced to retire from the race.\nThe Spaniard was subsequently found to be at fault for the crash and was issued a five-place grid penalty for the upcoming Mexican Grand Prix. He also received two penalty points on his F1 superlicence.\nGiving his view on the incident post-race, Button concluded that Sainz's failed overtaking attempt came unstuck because he braked too late and subsequently lost control.\nSainz had successfully passed Haas driver Oliver Bearman at the same corner just a few laps earlier.\nDespite this, Patrick explained that Sainz chose the wrong spot to overtake Antonelli.\n\"Not the best spot to go. When you make a move in an unusual place, then you get an unusual result,\" she said.\nAs Patrick's sentence trails off, Button is seen looking bemused at the camera with a thin grin — a public display of mockery.\nPatrick was facing away from Button at the time. His expression has been compared to Jim Halpert's iconic look into the camera from The Office.\nThis was not the first time that Sky F1 cameras have caught an awkward moment between Patrick and a colleague.\nButton was also captured making a similar face at the cameras while Patrick spoke during coverage of the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix, seemingly undermining her comments.\nPatrick is one of six women in key on-screen roles who regularly appear across the Sky F1 broadcast team's coverage. However, while women are featuring prominently as presenters and analysts, the main race-calling commentary booth remains overwhelmingly male.\nOnly five women have ever competed in an F1 grand prix, with the last one to start a race being Lella Lombardi in 1976.\nPatrick regularly provides analysis, bringing a diverse and insightful perspective to the broadcast as the most successful woman in American open-wheel racing history. However, her presence has been divisive among fans, and she is not universally well-liked.\nOn social media, F1 fans frequently criticise Patrick's commentary, often citing a lack of expertise and depth, and confusing analysis.\nHowever, regardless of the popularity of Patrick's commentary — or whether you agree with her opinions or not — colleagues, like Button, should treat each other with courtesy, dignity and respect.\nPatrick's perspective is built on high-level racing achievement, not merely presence or a diversity hire, and deserves professional respect.\nAt a time when F1 is actively working to include and platform more female voices, professionalism and maturity from the sport's leaders are crucial to fostering a diverse and welcoming environment for broadcasters, drivers, team principals and fans alike.",
