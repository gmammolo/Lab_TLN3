  "text": "The International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) has voted against allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutral athletes in the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympic qualifiers. This decision bars Russian participation from numerous events, potentially causing friction with host countries of the World Cup events. The International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) has made a decisive move to exclude athletes from Russia and Belarus from participating in the qualifiers for the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics. This directive also extends to Paralympic events overseen by FIS, maintaining its stance from 2022, when it initially barred national teams from these countries. The decision comes as FIS, the largest federation among those overseeing winter Olympic sports, remains firm in its policy against Russian representation, citing potential friction with host countries, primarily in northern Europe. Russia, though not a major player in Alpine skiing, has a strong presence in other winter sports categories, making the decision significant ahead of the Alpine World Cup kickoff in Austria. While the International Olympic Committee permits Russian athletes to compete as Individual Neutral Athletes, it leaves the final call to qualifying federations. While FIS has opted against this, other federations, including those for ice skating and ski mountaineering, have allowed a limited pathway for qualifiers, contrasting the firm stance seen in sports like hockey and biathlon.",
