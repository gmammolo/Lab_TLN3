  "text": "By Shabiha Akter ,\n1 hours ago\nhttps://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Davis-1-800x450.jpg Anthony Davis (Photo by X/@Fullcourtpass) Anthony Davis faced an early challenge even before his second season with the Dallas Mavericks officially began. Reports confirmed that the star forward will be sporting the protective goggles during games following a previous eye injury.\nDavis recently criticized the Los Angeles Lakers for contributing to the wear and tear on his body. However, this particular injury wasn’t linked to his former team. The eye issue stemmed from an accidental elbow to his right eye by teammate Daniel Gafford during a game last season.\nWhen the Mavericks tipped off their season opener against the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday, Davis took the court wearing his goggles. However, during the first quarter, he took another hit to the face. The moment left him so frustrated that he angrily ripped off his goggles and threw them toward the bench in irritation.\nThe night didn’t get much better for the Mavericks. They struggled on both ends of the floor and ultimately opened the season with a disappointing 125–92 loss at the American Airlines Center.\nDespite the defeat, Davis finished with 22 points, 13 rebounds, and one assist in 32 minutes of play.\nCharles Barkley Shares Confident Prediction On Healthy Anthony Davis And The Mavs Anthony Davis (Image Credits: Imagn) On Inside The NBA, analyst Charles Barkley made a bold claim regarding the Mavericks’ potential this season. He expressed a strong belief that Dallas could rise near the top of the Western Conference standings if Davis remains healthy and Kyrie Irving returns early in the season.\n“ If Anthony Davis plays 65 to 70 games, and Kyrie comes back at the beginning of the year, the Dallas Mavericks — they’re the second-best, in my opinion, they’re the second-best team in the Western Conference, ” Barkley said.\nUnfortunately for the Mavericks, recent reports indicate that Kyrie Irving will not return to the court until sometime in 2026. Until then, the Mavericks will rely heavily on Davis to carry the load and lead the team.\nThe post originally published on .",
