  "text": "It was a tough week for the Kingman football teams as all three suffered losses, hoping to either continue the momentum, or get it going.\nLee Williams came into the game ranked 16th as they hosted region opponent and No. 13 ranked Coconino for Senior Night. What started off as a close game, unfortunately turned for the Volunteers, falling 28-12. Both point after attempts were no good following the touchdowns from Cooper Cronk and Lucas Leist.",
