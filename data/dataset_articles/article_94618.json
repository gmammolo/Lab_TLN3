  "text": "This week in prep football saw a team on a bye, a game canceled due to weather and a close loss in downpour.\nLee Williams saw its win-streak break following Friday’s close loss to Bradshaw Mountain in a downpour. Due to the rain, the game was mostly on the ground as the two teams combined only had three completions on seven attempts. The Volunteers had 118 all purpose yards compared to the Bears’ 158.",
