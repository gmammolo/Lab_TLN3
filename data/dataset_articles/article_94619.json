  "text": "In the season opener for the Philadelphia 76ers, Joel Embiid is looking to bounce back from an injury-shortened 2024-25 season, and there are concerns that the former MVP doesn’t have much in the tank. After an injury-riddled career, the wear on his body adds up, and it’s not clear if he will ever be the same player who eviscerated opposing defenses.\nWatch What’s Trending Now!\nDuring a sequence against Philly’s season opener against the Boston Celtics, the big man shuffled through various sequences with little to no elevation. These clips quickly spread through social media, with one Instagram caption pointing out, “So… Joel Embiid is not jumping at ALL anymore… Are his knees cooked?”\nEmbiid, who didn’t even participate in the jump ball, looked pedestrian compared to his previous MVP-level dominance, his explosiveness and ability to bully defenses grounded – literally. Though an athletic marvel for his size, the injuries that limited him to just 19 games last year seem to have finally taken their toll on him.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nView this post on Instagram\nThrough training camp and preseason, the 76ers have been careful with Embiid, who has been put on a minutes restriction for the regular season. Embiid stepped onto the court for the first time in 237 days in the Sixers final preseason game, where he put in a solid effort, posting 14 points, 7 rebounds, 8 assists and 3 steals.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nFurthermore, sources around the league, including Chris Haynes, have painted a picture of calculated restraint. Embiid, fresh off left knee surgery, was cleared for preseason action, but no one inside the organization is pretending that means full steam ahead. The Sixers are walking a tightrope between ambition and caution, between chasing regular-season dominance and preserving the health of their franchise cornerstone.\nThe plan, according to those close to the situation, is deliberate. Don’t expect Embiid to suit up for back-to-backs, at least not early in the 2025–26 campaign. His minutes will be monitored, his workload meticulously managed. The days of Embiid being an every-night force in an 82-game grind are likely behind him- for now, the focus is on keeping him upright and explosive when the games that matter most finally arrive.\nAD\nPhiladelphia’s approach reflects a hard-earned lesson: for all of Embiid’s power and skill, his true value comes not in November or January, but when the lights are hottest in April and May. This isn’t a story of limitation- it’s one of preservation.\nFor Philly, the potential of having Embiid theoretically play close to full strength is reason enough to stay contending, and their addition of Paul George last offseason just showed how bought in they are. However, the team now faces a crossroads: should they be led by their 30-plus year old stars, or pivot to a younger core around All-Star Tyrese Maxey.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nThe optics of the Celtics game are hard to ignore. With Embiid looking as weak as he did in this outing, the Sixers have to seriously consider if building around Maxey, VJ Edgecombe and Jared McCain is the way to stay competent going forward in the Eastern Conference.\nFans Question Joel Embiid’s Longevity\nSocial media lit up after the clips of Embiid not jumping went viral, sparking debate about his ability to compete at the highest level. One fan said, “He’s made generational money, he should just retire before he loses the ability to work in his mid 30s,” highlighting concern over his long-term health and well-being.\nJoel Embiid’s 2025 season narrative can’t be told without rewinding to Paris- the summer where triumph and toll intertwined. His first Olympic run with Team USA was supposed to be a crowning moment, a celebration of belonging and dominance on the global stage. And in many ways, it was. Embiid helped deliver gold, anchoring the paint for a roster loaded with NBA stars.\nHe averaged 11.2 points on nearly 57% shooting, gave Team USA the interior presence it sorely needed, and had flashes- like his 14-point burst against Brazil in the quarterfinals- that reminded everyone why he’s one of the sport’s most unstoppable forces. But beneath the shine of that gold medal was a quieter cost.\nEmbiid entered the Olympics coming off a taxing season and knee concerns that hadn’t fully subsided. He chose to play anyway.\nMany viewers also expressed disappointment at seeing the star struggle, with one commenting, “Hate to see this. Was so good,” lamenting the contrast between Embiid’s peak during his MVP caliber seasons and last season, where he averaged just 23.8 points per game, a steep drop from the 33.1 points in his MVP season.\nAnother commentor added, “that’s a crazy clip…🤦🏾- but I thought Joel should’ve hung em up a couple years back🤷🏾♂️,” adding to the growing sentiment that Joel should retire sooner rather than later.\nOne viewer attributed his poor performance to another factor, saying, “Think it’s mostly confidence not pain,” noting the mental factors that could be at play, especially after a tough recovery period.\nMany also expressed concern about his physical condition outside the game of basketball, with one summing up the sentiment succinctly: “He is finished man. Not his fault but those knees are cooked well done.” Only time will tell if Joel Embiid will be able to bounce back, and help the Sixers contend in the upcoming season.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT",
