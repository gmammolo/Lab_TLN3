  "text": "On cusp of lost season, time for Flames to embrace Montreal-style rebuild\nThe Calgary Flames are teetering on the brink of a disappointing season, currently riding a seven-game losing streak and accumulating only three points in their first eight games. A 2-1 overtime loss to the Montreal Canadiens highlighted their deficiencies, specifically their lack of scoring power and high-end talent. With a dismal goal count of just 12 and a minus-16 goal differential, a rebuild akin to Montreal's successful model is being advocated. The Flames are encouraged to embrace a strategy of losing to rebuild talent, much like the Canadiens have done since 2022, which has propelled them to the top of the NHL standings.\n- The Flames have scored only 12 goals in 8 games, averaging 1.5 goals per game.\n- Historically, only 10 teams in the last 40 years have made the playoffs after starting a season with such a poor record.\n- The Flames currently sit with a 1-7-0 record, putting them at the bottom of the standings.\n- Montreal, contrastingly, has a strong start at 6-2-0, showcasing the effectiveness of their rebuild.\nAs the Flames navigate this season, a pivot towards a deliberate rebuild seems imminent. This may involve trading veterans and focusing on development and drafting, aiming to cultivate a core similar to Montreal's rising stars. Fans can expect a shift in strategy that prioritizes long-term gains over short-term performance.\nBottom LineCalgary must face the reality of its current situation and embrace the opportunity for a rebuild. Drawing inspiration from Montreal's recent success, the Flames need to draft effectively, develop their young core, and allow time for growth, moving towards a more sustainable future rather than clinging to a fading playoff hope.\nRead more at Sportsnet.ca\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
