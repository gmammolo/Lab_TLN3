  "text": "By Sam Guzman ,\n1 hours ago\nEL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — For the first time this season, New Mexico State football suffered a loss at Aggie Memorial Stadium.\nThe Aggies were handed a 24-17 loss in overtime by FBS and Conference USA newcomer Missouri State on Wednesday night.\nMissouri State took the lead in overtime with a 7-yard touchdown pass from Jacob Clark to Ronnel Johnson, putting the Bears up 24-17.\nNew Mexico State wasn’t able to respond with a touchdown of its own in OT. On 1st & 15 at Missouri State’s 30, Logan Fife’s pass intended for TK King was intercepted by Dylan Dixson, sealing the road win for Missouri State.\nA pass interference flag was initially thrown on the play but was later picked up, signaling no foul.\n“I thought the refs did a really poor job of explaining it before they ran off the field. I asked them what had gone on. They said that there was a pass interference penalty that was thrown. They said because there was an interception, there was no PI,” NM State football head coach Tony Sanchez said. “That doesn’t make any sense to me. If there’s a PI, there’s a PI. If there’s not, there’s not. It would have been nice for someone to come over and explain it, and nobody did.”\nLogan Fife had a tough outing, throwing four interceptions.\n“We had an egregious interception at the beginning of the 2nd half. We’re trying to throw the ball away. You can throw that ball into the bleachers. Logan’s a stud. He plays his tail off, but that’s just a technical thing. You don’t need to throw it down the field. Once you’re out of the pocket, you can go ahead and launch it in the stands. That was a big one right there, and we had some other ones, but I thought the turnovers put us in some bad situations.” NM State football head coach Tony Sanchez said postgame.\nHe completed 22 of 34 passes for 207 yards and one touchdown.\nThat touchdown came in clutch fashion—down 17-10 with just 2:23 left in the fourth, Fife led a 5-play, 65-yard drive capped by an 11-yard TD pass to Donovan Faupel, tying the game at 17-17 with 1:49 remaining.\nMissouri State kicker Yousef Obeid missed a 50-yard field goal as time expired in regulation, sending the game into overtime.\nMissouri State quarterback Jacob Clark didn’t have a perfect game, throwing two interceptions, but he stepped up when it mattered most in overtime.\nClark completed 28 of 44 passes for 283 yards and threw three touchdown passes, including the game-winner in OT.\nBoth of Clark’s interceptions in the contest went to Naeten Mitchell. The redshirt sophomore now has three interceptions on the season.\nEl Paso native and El Dorado High School graduate Isaiah Rudison scored the first rushing touchdown of his NCAA career. The redshirt junior scored a four-yard rushing touchdown to tie the game up 7-7 with 11:40 left in the second quarter.\nNew Mexico State’s defense recorded four sacks and seven tackles for loss. They also forced and recovered a key fumble during the game.\nWith the loss, New Mexico State falls to 3-4 overall and 1-3 in Conference USA play.\nNMSU now returns to playing its remaining games this season on Saturday.\nUp next, NM State will head to Bowling Green, Kentucky to face WKU on Saturday, November 1.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
