  "text": "The Dallas Mavericks opened the 2025–26 season on the wrong end of a statement performance from Victor Wembanyama , falling 125–92 to the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night at American Airlines Center.\nWembanyama, now in his third season, scored 40 points on 15-of-21 shooting to go with 15 rebounds, three blocks and a steal, leading San Antonio to a wire-to-wire victory. His 40-point, 15-rebound outing marked the third such performance of his career.\nCooper Flagg’s Debut Headlines Night of Contrasts Top overall pick Cooper Flagg made his long-awaited NBA debut, recording 10 points, 10 rebounds and a steal. The 18-year-old became the second-youngest player in NBA history to debut, behind only LeBron James , and the fifth Mavericks rookie ever to record a double-double in his first game.\n“It’s basketball,” Flagg said. “It’s not always going to go your way. It’s not always going to be perfect. But you got to adjust and be better on the fly.”\nThe night was uneven for Flagg, who shot 4-of-13 from the floor but showed flashes late in the third quarter with three straight baskets, including a reverse layup through contact.\n“He’s still a rookie,” Anthony Davis said. “Game one comes around, packed stadium, national TV, all the hype — he’ll be fine. It’s Game one. We’re all going to be better.”\nAnthony Davis Leads the Way for Dallas Davis led the Mavericks with 22 points, 13 rebounds, two steals, and a block — his 382nd career 20-point double-double, surpassing Larry Bird for 19th-most in NBA history. He also became the eighth player since 1996–97 to record 80 double-doubles in a single half after reaching 12 points and 10 rebounds by halftime.\nP.J. Washington added 17 points on 7-of-11 shooting, while Klay Thompson finished with 10 points. Rookie guard Ryan Nembhard chipped in 8 points and 5 assists, tying for the fourth-most assists by a Mavericks rookie in a debut.\nDespite making 9-of-21 from deep (42.9%), the Mavericks struggled to contain Wembanyama and the Spurs’ length. Dallas shot just 37.3% overall while allowing San Antonio to hit 57.5% of its attempts.\n“When you give up 31 fast-break points, you’re not going to win a lot of games,” coach Jason Kidd said. “This is Game 1 — we’ll learn from it.”\nSan Antonio Spurs’ Size and Pace Take Over Wembanyama’s impact extended well beyond scoring. His rim protection altered shots, disrupted lob attempts, and forced Dallas into foul trouble. The Spurs out-rebounded the Mavericks 50–37 and went on a decisive 13–0 run late in the second quarter to seize control.\n“Defensively, he blocked shots, stopped lobs, was in gaps,” Washington said. “We just got to be smarter when he’s out there and make better decisions as a group.”\nThe Spurs also received 22 points from Stephon Castle , 15 from Dylan Harper , and 13 from Devin Vassell .\nDallas Mavericks Statistical Highlights Dallas’ 21-of-26 free-throw shooting (.808) marked just the ninth time since last season the team has topped 80% on 25 or more attempts. The Mavericks also opened the season shooting at least 40% from three-point range for the 13th time in franchise history, and the first time in consecutive years since 2004–05.\nDespite the loss, Kidd said Flagg handled the spotlight the right way.\n“I thought Cooper played within himself,” Kidd said. “He took what the defense gave him and tried to play the game the right way. He’ll learn from this game. We all will.”\nDallas will look to rebound Friday night when it hosts the Washington Wizards at American Airlines Center.\nLatest Dallas Mavericks News & NBA Rumors",
