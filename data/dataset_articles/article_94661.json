  "text": "LANAO del Norte’s Satar Salem is eager to break his winless streak as he leads a formidable field in the men’s category of the 5150 Dapitan, set to unfold on Sunday (Sept. 8) in Zamboanga del Norte.\nSalem, who last won at 5150 Bohol in 2022, will face a talented field, including Jailani Lamama, Mohamad Maruhom, Arden Gonzales, James Montero, and young standouts Matthew Hermosa, Kenneth Bonda, and Akio Habana, among others, as they gear up for a spirited battle in their respective age group divisions and the overall championship.\nThe battle for the women’s tiara is also expected to be intense after Erika Burgos withdrew at the last minute due to personal reasons, leaving the fight among Samantha Flores, Karen dela Peña, Cleo Lim, Rhijina Janda and Nicole Andaya in the final triathlon championship of the season.\nThis year’s 5150 Dapitan, which takes place in a historically rich setting under the Olympic-style format, has drawn international participants from the US, Great Britain, Brazil, Switzerland, Greece, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa, promising intense competition across various age categories.\nAdding more excitement to the event, organized by The Ironman Group and hosted by Dapitan City under the leadership of Mayor Seth “Bullet” Jalosjos, is the Go for Gold Sunrise Sprint, a shorter course featuring a 750-meter open-water swim, a 20-km bike ride, and a 5-km run.\nThe Noli Run, a 4-km fun run featuring over 300 participants, kicks off on Saturday, further enhancing the festive weekend atmosphere in Dapitan.",
