  "text": "During a media appearance on Shannon Sharpe's podcast, John Cena explained why he believes Roman Reigns is the Greatest Of All Time, attributing WWE's box office success to Reigns. Cena stated, \"He's been in a main event lens for over a decade. In 2012, the stock was trading at $11. WWE/TKO stock is now at $117. That's on his shoulders. There isn't a better indication, and I know it's a team effort, and nobody does it alone, but that, to me, is some serious shit. I have to give respect where it's due. [Roman] is smart, passionate about the business, multi-generational athlete. Has respect for his family, the locker room, the business. He's a very smart performer and someone I respect. He'd be my Greatest of All Time.\" [ ](/wrestling/aew-dynamite-94-viewership-and-rating-drop-ahead-aew-all-out) Appearing at [Bloomberg's New York Power Players](https://youtu.be/H8Kvz6wjHB0), Roman was asked about Cena's comments. \"The numbers don't lie,\" he said with a smile. \"I wish I could say, 'I'm Taylor Swift out there,' but we have a great team. I have a Wiseman. Business has been really good. It's one of those weird situations. This is where I would normally be like, 'Paul, brag about me.' At the end of the day, it's subjective. There are some objective metrics involved that we can measure. If there's 60 people over here that are like, 'No, Roman Reigns is the GOAT.' Then there's two people who go, 'No way. The Undertaker is the Greatest of All Time.' How do you argue with those two people that believe in their soul that the Undertaker is? That's the weird part of our job, and that's the beauty of it. It's where objective and subjective meet. It can really be whatever you feel it is. As long as you are connected to whose ever product in WWE you are connected to, I think you have the right to claim that superstar being the greatest of all time, to you. As far as what John said, I kind of witnessed and observed his early reign as WWE's top guy and face of the company. Nobody knows better about everything that it takes to get to that point and be in that conversation. I guess I'm just going to agree with him,\" said Roman. Roman returned to WWE at WWE SummerSlam after being off television following his loss at WrestleMania XL. Reigns was part of the subsequent episodes of WWE SmackDown, but it is unknown when he will return after being taken out by Solo Sikoa, Jacob Fatu, Tama Tonga, & Tonga Loa on the August 16th episode of WWE SmackDown.
