  "text": "Tony Khan is looking forward to raking in the cash. Since 2019, AEW has made strides as a professional wrestling business, hosting three weekly television shows and drawing some of the biggest wrestling crowds across the globe. [ ](/wrestling/wesley-eisold-sues-cody-rhodes-wwe-and-fanatics-over-american-nightmare-trademark) With a new media rights deal on the horizon, fans are positive about the future of the company. As it turns out, Tony Khan believes that it's reasonable to say that AEW will soon become the second most profitable company in the history of wrestling. \"I think it is reasonable.\" Tony Khan said when the question was proposed by Dave Meltzer of F4W Online during the recent AEW All Out media call. \"Whether those cash flows happen overnight when the new deal kicks in, I can’t say those things for sure yet. There is still a lot to be figured out. I do think the die is cast that AEW is going to be the second most profitable wrestling company, at this point, of all time, which is very impressive for a promotion that is just over five years old and has been on television for less than five years. It’s amazing how quickly we’re expended. The expansion of the television product going from two hours a week to five hours a week. Being very excited about what the future holds in our media deal. It’s a really great time for the company. As getting into the semantics and mechanics of the accounting, and how we’re counting all the dollars, I’m not sure exactly how much money WCW made in 1998, nor am I honestly sure how much Jim Crockett was making in 1986, but over the duration of this deal, I expect, over this multi-year period that we’re about to enter into, that we will be the second most profitable wrestling company in the history of the wrestling business. It’s a really exciting thing, and it’s also only the beginning. It’s the beginning of a really long journey. It’s been long journey, but it’s still early in the long journey. We’re really building for the future.\" Elsewhere in the call, Khan provided an update on talks between AEW and Warner Brothers Discovery.
