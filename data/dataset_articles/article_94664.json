  "text": "As LeBron James gears up to enter his 22nd year in the NBA, he’s set to release his 22nd entry in his Nike LeBron line of signature shoes. While he’s offered basketball models outside of his main franchise, often positioned as budget options, he’s expanding his partnership with Nike in a new direction with his first training shoe — the Nike LeBron TR1 (Trainer 1).\nRumored towards the end of last year, the shoe was first spotted during James’ historic run at this year’s Olympic Games. Now, following a set of official imagery of the new trainer, the Swoosh has officially announced the sneaker. The TR1 sports what is described as an “ergonomic and lightweight design” — one that sees the typical strobel unit removed in favor of athletes coming closer to the foam cushioning while a new inverted waffle outsole backs key movement. Its glove-like bootie combines with a wide last to combat the swelling of feet one often faces while training.\n“The TR1 is for the athlete who’s in constant pursuit of greatness and puts in the work, day in and day out,” says James. “Training is a huge part of my journey, and this shoe is designed for athletes to use during any workout, any time, any place.”\nThe new silhouette will debut in its gray and neon green “Dunk Man” colorway on September 19 via Nike SNKRS and select retailers at a starting price of $130 USD. From there, a “Zero Dark 30” look favors a monochromatic flavor that will arrive on October 10. The “Purple Rain” pair will drop on October 23, the day after the NBA resumes play for the 2024-25 season. Lastly, an orange “Better With Age”-themed take on the shoe is due to hit shelves on November 11. Read Full Article",
