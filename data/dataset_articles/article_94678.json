  "text": "Tee Higgins Ready To Celebrate Potential Ja'Marr Chase Extension CINCINNATI — Tee Higgins is amped to roll into another NFL season, hopefully with Ja'marr Chase across from him on offense this Sunday. The Bengals wide receiver is very confident Chase will be his normal self on Sunday if he plays amidst ongoing contract negotiations. \"Yeah, y'all ain't gonna see no change,\" Higgins declared to the media on Thursday. \"It's gonna be the same Ja'Marr at the end of the day.\" Chase has been active at the Bengals ramped-up practices over the past two days ahead of the New England matchup. He's reportedly \"kind of\" close on a new deal with Cincinnati. Meanwhile, Higgins is about to play on the franchise tag over the next few months. \"I'll be happy for him,\" Higgins said about his buddy landing the potential deal. \"I know, he's looking for it. Sh*t, I want him to have it myself, so it's exciting, and hopefully it gets done.\" Bookmark Bengals Talk for the latest news, exclusive interviews, film breakdowns and so much more!
