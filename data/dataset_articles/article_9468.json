  "text": "LOS ANGELES — All 31 construction workers who were far inside a huge industrial tunnel in Los Angeles made it to safety after a portion of it collapsed Wednesday evening, an outcome officials called a blessing after they initially feared much worse.\nThe cave-in apparently happened between the tunnel boring machine, 5 miles in from the only entrance, and the construction crew working 6 miles in, said Michael Chee, spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, which is in charge of the nearly $700 million project. The workers were about 400 feet underground.\nThe tunnel is being constructed almost entirely underneath public right-of-way. The structure is 18 feet wide and will be 7 miles long to carry treated wastewater from across Los Angeles County to the Pacific Ocean.\nFirefighters said workers had to climb over 12 to 15 feet of fallen dirt and debris to reach the tunnel boring machine and then were transported back to the opening. Some people had to be pulled out.\n\"They had to make themselves out through and then rescuers actually came to them to assist them out,\" Fire Department Chief Ronnie Villanueva said.\nAerial footage showed workers being brought out of the tunnel in a yellow cage hoisted up by a crane. None had major injuries, authorities said.\nArally Orozco said she was at church when her phone started buzzing with calls and her son texted her the news of the tunnel where her three brothers worked.\n\"It was sad and scary,\" she said in Spanish. \"We feared the worst.\"\nAfter an hour, she managed to get through to one brother who told her they had to squeeze through a tight space to get out.\n\"My brother was crying,\" she said. \"He told me he thought he was going to die underground.\"\nL.A. City Councilmember Tim McOsker praised the workers for keeping cool heads.\n\"This is a highly technical, difficult project. And they knew exactly what to do. They knew how to secure themselves,\" he said. \"Thank goodness for the good people that were down in the tunnel.\"\nMayor Karen Bass said at a news conference that she met with some of the workers.\n\"I know when we raced down here I was so concerned that we were going to find tragedy. Instead, what we found was victory,\" Bass said. \"All of the men that were in that tunnel, rescued, up, safe.\"\nThe cause is under investigation, Chee said. Work will not resume until they can figure out what happened and determine that it's safe to proceed, authorities said.\nPhotos\nMost recent U.S. stories\nRelated topics\nU.S.",
