  "text": "Shohei Ohtani spent the first six seasons of his MLB career with the Los Angeles Angels and set multiple records as a two-way player, but never got to experience October baseball.\nOhtani left the Angels to sign a record-setting 10-year, $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers last offseason partly due to the organization’s stretch of recent success.\nThe Dodgers have clinched a postseason berth in every year since 2013, winning the National League West in all but of one of those (2021). With just over three weeks remaining in the regular season, they are in the driver’s seat to capture another division title.\nOhtani said he has enjoyed being part of a playoff race for the first time in his career, via Bill Plunkett of the Southern California News Group :\n“Personally, it’s my first time being able to experience being at this spot in the standings and being able to play against other division rivals who are trying to take the spot as well,” Ohtani said. “So personally yes, it’s very exciting.”\nOhtani teamed up with Mike Trout and other All-Star caliber players during his time with the Angels, but untimely injuries ultimately prevented the team from living up to their potential.\nOhtani took the blame for some of that as he missed stretches of games in multiple seasons due to injury:\n“There were seasons where we played well as a team, but there were also seasons where I really didn’t play at all,” he said, referring to the injuries that took him out of the lineup. “If I did, in those situations maybe the results would’ve been different.”\nOhtani has been largely healthy during his first season with the Dodgers, playing in all but three of the team’s 140 games thus far.\nOhtani has been limited to designated hitter duties this season as he recovers from elbow surgery, but plans to return to the mound next year.\nShohei Ohtani closing in on 50-50 season As Ohtani inches closer to playing in his first postseason game, he is also on the verge of making MLB history.\nThe 30-year-old is six home runs and four stolen bases away from posting the first 50-50 season , with 23 games left on the Dodgers’ regular-season schedule.\nHave you subscribed to the Dodger Blue YouTube channel ?
