While bet365, Caesars, ESPN BET, and Fanatics all have some version of a $1,000 offer, BetMGM’s first-bet offer goes all the way up to $1,500. If that number is staggering to you, don’t worry. You’re not obligated to wager the full $1,500. In fact, if you want to place a $50 bet on the Ravens to win or the Chiefs to cover the spread, you can. If you’d rather go for a bigger cash profit by betting $100 on Travis Kelce to score the first TD of the game, that’s available as well. If the bet loses, you’ll get back bonus bets that you can use on NFL Week 1 and more. How to Sign Up with BetMGM NFL Bonus Code PITTSPORTS1500 Signing up with BetMGM should only take a few minutes. Complete the registration steps below to get in on the action ahead of Ravens-Chiefs: - Click [here](https://xlmediaplc.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=62&aff_id=1020&url_id=137&file_id=32)and enter BetMGM NFL bonus code PITTSPORTS1500. - Register for an account by providing your full name, address, phone number, and birthdate. - Make an initial deposit of $10 or more to activate the $1,500 first bet offer. - Navigate to the Ravens-Chiefs game. - Place your first bet of up to $1,500 on any qualifying market.

Losing your first bet will earn you back bonus bets, which can be applied to games taking place in any league this week. Second-Chance TD Scorer Promo Offers Cash Refund Virtually every second-chance in-app promo in legal online sports betting will issue bonus bets with a loss. In fact, BetMGM has one available via the Pro Football No-Sweat Token offer. There’s one promo in the BetMGM app that stands in stark contrast, as it offers a cash refund. The Second Chance TD Scorer promo requires players to wager on any player to score the first touchdown of the game. If your selected player doesn’t score the first TD, but ends up scoring the second of the game, BetMGM will refund your cash wager.
