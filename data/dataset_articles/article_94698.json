  "text": "Red balloons returning to Memorial Stadium for Nebraska-Colorado football game\nAn old tradition is returning to the Sea of Red.\nRed balloons will be back at Memorial Stadium on Saturday night for the Nebraska-Colorado football game after a two-season hiatus.\n\"As we celebrate the rich tradition between the two schools and honor our 1994 national championship team, Nebraska Athletics will bring back a Memorial Stadium tradition of releasing balloons after the Huskers’ first touchdown. Red balloons will be distributed at no cost in and around Memorial Stadium by Husker Athletics staff,\" Nebraska Athletics said in a statement.\nWhat you need to know for Nebraska football against Colorado\nNebraska and the National Football Foundation will\nhonor former Husker coach Frank Solich with an NFF Hall of Fame on-campus salute during the game.\nThe athletic department said they would consider bringing the balloons back for \"select special occasions.\"\nThe balloons soared after Husker touchdowns for more than 60 years, but the tradition took a pause in 2022\ndue to a helium shortage, then-NU Athletic Director Trev Alberts said.\nIn the past, the University of Nebraska has faced criticism from environmentalists, who say balloon releases are mass littering.",
