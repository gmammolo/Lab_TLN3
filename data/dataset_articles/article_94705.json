  "text": "Five-star guard prospect Jasper Johnson, one of the top prospects in the Class of 2025, committed to Kentucky on Thursday. Johnson is the No. 10 overall prospect and No. 2 shooting guard in his class in the 247Sports composite rankings. He will play with Overtime Elite in the upcoming season before heading to his hometown of Lexington, Ky., to join the Wildcats and new coach Mark Pope. \"I feel like it was the best decision for me to grow and develop as a student-athlete,\" Johnson said during his live announcement on 247Sports' digital channels. \"My parents went there. Being able to have this opportunity being from the city and being able to represent my city and state, I feel like this was the best decision for me.\" Johnson chose Kentucky over finalists Alabama, Arkansas, Louisville and North Carolina. Former Kentucky head coach John Calipari left for the same job at Arkansas earlier this year. Johnson is listed at 6-foor-4, 175 pounds and is Kentucky's second commit of the cycle. Four-star center Malachi Moreno, another Kentucky native, pledged to the Wildcats last month.\nG Jasper Johnson, No. 10 prospect in ‘25, commits to Kentucky\n[0](/sports/national_sports/g-jasper-johnson-no-10-prospect-in-25-commits-to-kentucky/article_64e878da-7aca-5602-9215-7641562ab765.html#comments)\n ",
