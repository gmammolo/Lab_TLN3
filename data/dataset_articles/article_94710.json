  "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo is showing no signs of relenting when it comes to scoring goals. Even though he's left European club football behind, he's still plundering goals in the Saudi Pro League for Al Nassr, and has no plans yet to retire from the international game. Ronaldo is still a key part of the Portugal squad and, although he could not help them to glory at Euro 2024, his next appearance for his country in September 2024 saw him reach the milestone of 900 career goals . The Sporting News details Ronaldo's scoring record for Portugal and other key bits of CR7 information. MORE: How many goals has Cristiano Ronaldo scored for Al Nassr? How many goals does Cristiano Ronaldo have for Portugal? Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time leading goalscorer in men's international football with an outrageous record of 131 goals in 213 senior appearances for Portugal. Ronaldo broke the long-standing goal record that was held by Iran's Ali Daei when he bagged a brace against Republic of Ireland in September 2021. Ronaldo's 211 caps for Portugal also put him at the top of international football's all-time appearance list, ahead of Kuwait star Bader Al-Mutawa who has played 196 times for his country. Portugal are the ONLY European team to qualify for the knockout stage of the Euros in every single edition in the 21st century.— The CR7 Timeline.
