  "text": "Arsenal have announced their star-studded squad for the new league phase of the 2024/25\nChampions League, aiming to go deep in this season’s competition.\nAfter a memorable last-16 penalty shootout win over Porto and an agonising 3-2 aggregate loss to German giants\nBayern Munchen, the Gunners will be hoping to rewrite history and announce themselves as one of the main contenders for this year's title.\n-\nWho has made the squad?\nSurprise inclusions for\nMikel Arteta’s side include Kieran Tierney as part of the defensive unit. The Scottish international has only just returned to the training pitch after suffering a hamstring injury at the Euro 2024 this summer. England youth international, Tommy Setford, is also part of List A alongside new signing Neto.\nOther summer signings that will be hoping to make their Arsenal\nChampions League debuts are Italy’s Euro 2024 breakout star, Riccardo Calafiori, Euro 2024 winner, Mikel Merino, and the on-loan Raheem Sterling from Chelsea.\nTwo separate lists can be submitted to make up the squad for the\nChampions League - A and B.\nList A consists of 25 players, two must be goalkeepers and eight must be ‘locally trained players’.\nA locally trained player is someone who has been club-trained on Arsenal’s books for three whole seasons or 26 months between the ages of 15 and 21.\nOr, association-trained players who were on another club's books in the same association for three whole seasons of 36 months between the ages of 15 and 21.\n-\nList A in full:\nGoalkeepers:\nDavid Raya, Neto and https://www.vavel.com/en/football/2024/07/15/arsenal/1188439-arsenal-confirm-tommy-setford-signing-from-ajax.html\nDefenders:\nBen White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Jurrien Timber, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Jakub Kiwior, Riccardo Calafiori, Takehiro Tomiyasu and https://www.vavel.com/en/football/2024/06/24/arsenal/1186247-how-arsenals-players-fared-in-matchday-three-at-euro-2024.html\nMidfielders:\nThomas Partey, Martin Odegaard, Jorginho, https://www.vavel.com/en/football/2024/08/13/arsenal/1192455-what-arsenal-need-in-the-final-weeks-of-the-transfer-window.html and Declan Rice\nForwards:\nBukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard, Kai Havertz and https://www.vavel.com/en/football/2023/05/02/arsenal/1145635-arsenal-vs-chelsea-premier-league-preview-gameweek-34-2023.html\nList A can be altered if Arsenal make the round of 16 in February 2025 and they will be able to register a further three players who may be new signings or players returning from injury. However, the rule of a maximum of 25 players with at least eight locally trained players remains.\n-\nWhere are the\nHale Endyouth stars?\nThere is no place for standout youth players such as\nEthan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly in List A because UEFA allows under-21 players to be chosen on List B no later than 00:00 CET on the night before each match of the competition.\nA player can be included in List B if they are born on, or after, January 1st 2003 and have been eligible to play for two years since their 15th birthday.\nArteta can choose an unlimited number of under-21 players for his\nChampions League squads depending on their availability, meaning that we are likely to see the likes of Nwaneri, Lewis-Skelly, Ayden Heaven and Josh Nichols as part of the squad at some point in the season.\n-\nWho will Arsenal face in the new league phase?\nAs there is now one whole league for the\nhttps://www.vavel.com/en/football/2024/08/07/arsenal/1191638-time-to-turn-success-into-silverware-arsenal-season-preview-202425.html instead of separate groups, each team will play eight games to see if they can make it to the last 16.\nArsenal will play four home games and four away games and if they finish in the top eight then they will reach the knockout rounds automatically.\nWho Arsenal will face\nWith Arsenal being drawn out of pot 2 they will face some of Europe’s finest in the early stages of the competition. This includes a home tie against\nLuis Enrique’s Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and an away tie at Inter, where the Gunners famously won 1-5 over 20 years ago.\nThere are also some tricky away opponents in\nAtalanta and Girona where Arteta’s side will have to deal with some thunderous atmospheres to take away all three points.\nArsenal’s opponent list in full:\nAtalanta (A) - Thursday 19 September 2024, 20:00 BST\nPSG (H) - Tuesday 1 October 2024, 20:00 BST\nShakhtar Donetsk (H) - Tuesday 22 October 2024, 20:00 BST https://www.vavel.com/en/football/2021/07/21/arsenal/1078854-why-arsenal-pulled-out-of-the-florida-cup.html (A) - Wednesday 6 November 2024, 20:00 GMT Sporting (A) - Tuesday 26 November 2024, 20:00 GMT Monaco (H) - Wednesday 11 December 2024, 20:00 GMT\nDinamo Zagreb (H) - Wedesnday 22 January 2025, 20:00 GMT\nGirona (A) - Wednesday 29 January 2025, 20:00 GMT",
