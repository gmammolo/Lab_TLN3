  "text": "Florida State might not have gotten the result they wanted on the field on Monday against Boston College, but it wasn’t all bad news. Four-star linebacker Izayia Williams committed to the Seminoles just days after the game and another key target had a great time.\nFour-star defensive tackle Trashawn Ruffin , a 2026 recruit, attended the game and spoke with On3’s Steve Wiltfong about the great atmosphere.\n“Florida State was great,” he said. “The atmosphere and the hospitality! Gave me straight goosebumps watching the game.”\nRuffin is the No. 337 overall player and No. 33 defensive lineman in the On3 industry ranking. The 6-foot-3, 303-pounder is also the No. 17 player from North Carolina.\nThe Seminoles offered Ruffin a scholarship back in May and have now hosted him on multiple visits as they work to add him to their 2026 recruiting class , which is still looking for its first addition along the line of scrimmage.\nContact/Follow us @ FSUWire on X (Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Auburn news, notes, and opinions.
