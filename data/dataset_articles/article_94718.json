  "text": "LOS ANGELES — The word immortality was always special to Caleb Williams, a word that represented a legacy forever left, cementing that one’s name would circle through rooms they would never walk into.\nThe goal to cement that for himself at USC was a national championship, as Williams expressed before the start to last season. And such lofty expectations led to the most trying season of his career , with losing stretches and playoff hopes quickly dashed and a bevy of character attacks on the former Heisman winner.\nOn Thursday, though, the now-Chicago Bears quarterback Williams became immortal in a wholly different light, as USC announced on Twitter the school had retired his No. 13 jersey with a star-studded video fitting for a quarterback who helped restore glamour to college football in Southern California.\nCongratulations poured in from singer John Legend, whose song “Ordinary People” Williams performed – shakily – as part of a rookie ritual with the Bears displayed on the show “Hard Knocks;” Snoop Dogg, who dubbed him “nephew” while surrounded by an appropriate cloud of smoke; head coach Lincoln Riley, the man who brought Williams from Norman, Oklahoma to USC; and even fellow Trojan women’s basketball star JuJu Watkins.\nSeveral of his former teammates, too, assembled on Howard Jones Field for well wishes.\n“Caleb, one-three, 13, we just wanted to say congratulations on getting your jersey retired,” said Trojans quarterback Miller Moss, flanked by teammates like Jaylin Smith and Zachariah Branch.\nWilliams led USC to the brink of the College Football Playoff in 2022, captivating the college football world in a Heisman Trophy campaign that included throwing for 4,537 yards and amassing 52 touchdowns. His junior season, before being drafted by the Bears, saw a slight step back in stats and team success, but he still ranked among the most efficient quarterbacks in the nation.\nRelated Articles College Sports | USC WR Ja’Kobi Lane finds stability while trying to be ‘the one’ College Sports | Keyed by improved preparation, USC’s run defense has been born anew College Sports | Not the tallest or fastest, USC’s jaw-dropping Kyron Hudson thrives on physicality College Sports | USC investigated QB Miller Moss in 2022 over roommate dispute College Sports | Swanson: USC was a big winner in high-risk, high-reward showdown with LSU Along the way, he became perhaps the face of the name, image and likeness movement in college athletics, building a remarkable portfolio of sponsorships and commercial appearances, and was frequently praised for his foundation Caleb Cares’ work with a local Boys and Girls Club in Los Angeles.\nUSC revealed on Thursday, too, that Williams’ No. 13 banner under the peristyle at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will set next to renewed Heisman winner Reggie Bush’s No. 5, the former superstar running back seeing another step toward vindication after a long legal battle with the NCAA .",
