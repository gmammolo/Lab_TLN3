  "text": "Dauphin Junior High School’s eighth-grade football team lit up Wildcat Stadium’s scoreboard lights Tuesday, downing New Brockton High School’s Gamecocks, 35-0, despite having three touchdowns reversed by penalties. Dauphin’s Hayes Weber set the evening’s tone with a 65-yard touchdown run on the game’s first play; Jace Trull added the PAT with 7:40 left in the first quarter, 7-0, DJHS led. Weber had four carries that counted for 135 yards plus waived off scoring jaunts of 73 and 70 yards. New Brockton was unable to move the ball on its first possession; New Brockton’s Micah Davis intercepted a Dauphin pass shortly thereafter but to no avail when the Gamecocks couldn’t produce a first down. After having Weber’s 73-yard run negated, Dauphin went to the air; David Killingsworth connected with James Hardrick on an 83-yard scoring strike. Trull’s PAT put DJHS ahead, 14-0, with nine seconds remaining in the first period. Dauphin defenders gave little ground throughout the game, but New Brockton kept the ball all but four plays in the second quarter. People are also reading… On the second Dauphin snap, Wilkerson raced 71 yards for the TD; Trull added the PAT making it 21-0, a score that remained unchanged until midway through the third quarter when Hardrick intercepted an NBHS pass and scooted 62 yards for the period’s lone touchdown. Trull added the PAT; Dauphin led, 28-0. After Weber’s 70-yard scoring jaunt was waived off late in the third period, the Fins controlled the ball early in the fourth period and had a third TD reversed by a penalty that put the ball at Brockton’s 42-yard line. Del Fulton broke a run to the visitor’s 7-yard line and after a series of penalties, Dauphin got the game’s final score, a 22-yard pass completion from Killingsworth to Hardrick. Trull’s PAT ended scoring at 35-0, with 2:48 left to play. Ty’Rell Ryder and Kardai Patterson also ran the ball for Dauphin. Mason Carrington, Kaiden Jackson, Shakir Middleton, Cole Danford and Carter Johnson shared time in New Brockton’s offensive backfield.",
