  "text": "The No. 1 Georgia Bulldogs are getting a bargain Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) opponent in the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles . The University of Georgia is paying Tennessee Tech just $550,000 to play at Sanford Stadium on Saturday, Sept. 7 at 2:00 p.m. ET.\nFCS teams can receive over $2 million to play against top Power Four football teams like Georgia, so the Bulldogs are getting a bargain to play against Tennessee Tech. Georgia is favored to win by over seven touchdowns.\nThe Georgia-Tennessee Tech game will be televised on ESPN+/SEC Network+. Georgia will look to extend its home winning streak to 26 games against the Golden Eagles.\n“There are 5.9 billion people in the world and there’s a tiny, tiny percentage of them that can ever say they had the opportunity to play the best in the\nworld at their sport, at their age group,” said Tennessee Tech head coach Bobby Wilder. “Which is what we have the opportunity to do this weekend.”\nMore Football Tennessee Tech vs. No. 1 Georgia football key players Rece Davis updates his top 10 college football rankings What Tennessee Tech's coach said about facing Georgia This is a big chance to Tennessee Tech to get some national exposure.
