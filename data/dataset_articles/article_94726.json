Log in here »\nJeff Gustafson is good with the Elite Series’ new forward-facing sonar (FFS) rules but remains unsure about the impact they’ll have on pro bass fishing’s premier circuit.\nStarting next year, competitors will be limited to just one live sonar transducer mounted to the trolling motor at the front of their boat. Previously, they could have unlimited transducers on their vessels.\nThe Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (BASS) will provide a list of acceptable live transducers from all major electronics manufacturers. Equipment not listed will be banned from use in both the Elite Series and US$1-million Bassmaster Classic, the sport’s premier event.\nAngler Jeff Gustafson from Kenora, Ont. holds a rod and a Smeltinator jig in a handout photo. THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-Bass Anglers Sportsman Society **MANDATORY CREDIT** “It’s kind of what I was expecting and I’m fine with it,” Gustafson said. “At the end of the day I don’t think it’s going to change a lot.\n“It might slow guys down a bit as far as how fast they can find them but really … you only need one to be pretty effective.”\nThe changes do create a more level playing field.\n“It certainly does a little bit because it was getting crazy some of these guys having five or six live sonar transducers on their boat,” Gustafson said.\nOn Monday, the National Professional Fishing League — another U.S.-based pro bass circuit — banned the use of FFS in 2025.\nAlso starting next year, Elite Series competitors will be limited to a total of 55 inches of screen, including bow and dash-head units. BASS said the evolution of bigger screens was “becoming a safety concern.”\nOther changes include:\n– Only one electric motor per boat. Recently, others had appeared on shallow-water anchors, making it difficult to enforce rules prohibiting techniques such as trolling.\n– BASS will focus on a more diverse Elite Series schedule that incorporates varied fishing styles so experience and understanding fish behaviour can be taken more into account.\n“It will be interesting to see how many different lakes there are (on ’25 schedule),” Gustafson said. “There’s always a couple every year where it (FFS) isn’t really a factor but these guys find ways to use it just about everywhere we go.”\nFFS — notably Garmin’s Livescope — has taken fishing by storm. Last year, many Elite Series competitors ran anywhere from three to six units on their boats.\nBut that caused division, with many in the sport feeling technology has overtaken wisdom and experience in pro bass fishing.\nIn 2023, Gustafson became the first Canadian to win the Classic using one FFS unit on the Tennessee River. Gustafson has readily admitted he’s not a fan of the technology but felt compelled to run two units this year to remain competitive.\nGustafson wasn’t alone. Fellow Canadians Cooper Gallant and brothers Chris and Cory Johnston all ran multiple FFS units on their boats. Gallant, of Bowmanville, Ont., went from one unit in 2023 to three this year while the Johnstons used four on their boats.\nGallant, like Gustafson, added more units to remain competitive. But he’s more than good with the changes.\n“I think it’s a good tool but whatever the rules are in 2025, I’m just ready to go,” Gallant said. “I’m going to do whatever they tell me to and adapt to it.\n“In the end, it’s fishing. We still have to try to catch five of these bass and the rules are the rules.”\nBoth Gustafson and Gallant said the screen modification won’t apply to them as the units they used this year were a combined 54 inches.\nChris Johnston, of Peterborough, Ont., became the first Canadian to win the Elites’ Series overall title in 2024 while Cory Johnston, of Cavan, Ont., won two events. Not only did that make Cory Johnston the winningest Canuck on the circuit but marked the first time a Canadian had won multiple tournaments in the same year.\nThe brothers weren’t immediately available for comment Thursday. But this season Chris Johnston won a no-FFS tournament on Georgia’s Lake Lanier, earning US$65,000 for the victory and another $5,000 for the event’s biggest fish.\nGustafson understands why FFS is such a big deal with many anglers: It works.\n“I had probably three or four tournaments where every single fish I caught was because I could see them,” he said. “Just fish you’d almost have to get lucky to catch if you didn’t have it.”\nHowever, Gustafson has noticed fish are becoming more wary of FFS.\nWinnipeg Free Press | Newsletter Business Weekly Monday mornings\nThe latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week.\nSign up for Business Weekly Sign Up I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies , and CASL agreement . “The fish you target with it are getting wiser and harder to catch,” he said. “You’re seeing more anglers using finesse techniques with spinning rods when it used to be all baitcasters on the deck for these guys.”\nStill, FFS is something Gustafson will continue working with and fine tuning.\n“For years, many of the tournaments where I could fish offshore deeper, I’d usually have a pretty good result,” he said. “Now, many of those tournaments that are my favourite ones I’m getting my butt whipped.\n“Obviously these guys are that much more efficient and better at it than I am. I’m using it and trying to get better with it every day.”\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 5, 2024.\nAdvertisement Advertise With Us\nAdvertisement Advertise With Us\nTweet Share Print Email Read Later",
