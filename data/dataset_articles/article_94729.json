  "text": "Success is expected within the Good Counsel football program. As players leave team meetings, they walk past the school’s collection of athletic memorabilia: Stefon Diggs’s Pro Bowl jersey is featured on the wall next to an impressive photo display of national signing day scenes. The interlocked school initials on the Falcons’ gold helmets are replicated in jewels on the team’s championship rings. Last season, the Falcons earned a Washington Catholic Athletic Conference title and finished atop The Washington Post’s end-of-season rankings — the first time since 2019 they had accomplished either feat. Powering that success was a star-studded senior class, one of the best in the nation . That group came through the program together and went out on top. Now it’s up to the next generation of players to take up the torch. The No. 2 Falcons have an array of new starters this season, including seven on defense. But that doesn’t mean they don’t have ambitions to repeat last season’s achievements. “Kids come here because they want to play high school football at the highest level, they want to go on and play college football at the highest level and they want to win championships,” Coach Andy Stefanelli said. “They know what the standard is when they get here.” In high school football, player development and program building are in many ways one and the same. Today’s cornerstones once practiced with the scout team and spent game days on the sidelines. Senior running back Joseph Williams spent much of the past three seasons backing up Dilin Jones, a four-star prospect now at Wisconsin. The two formed a close bond, with Williams pointing to Jones as a mentor. Now the Falcons’ featured back, Williams turned his first touch of the season into an 80-yard touchdown run in the team’s season-opening win against Columbus (Fla.) last week. He hopes it will be remembered as the start of a breakout season. “We’re trying to win a championship, and every single person on this team is a key part of it,” Williams said. “Me and a lot of my other teammates were there last season — we weren’t key players. Now we get our time to shine.” Quarterback Frankie Weaver captained Good Counsel’s offense for three years, but his graduation opened the door for a new starter. Enter sophomore Jackson Rice. This is Rice’s first season starting at the varsity level after a year of practicing with the Falcons but playing on the junior varsity. Stefanelli stands behind Rice at every practice, hovering a body length away with the answer to any question about verbiage, scheme or approach. Weaver received the same instruction when he was coming into his own as a sophomore. The quarterback, now at Monmouth, helped Rice learn what it takes to step into a role in which leadership is a requirement. “Frankie really helped me understand the playbook, how to read defenses and really just how to be a starter,” Rice said. “Being the quarterback, I know the ball’s in my hands every single play. ... I have to be a leader. I have to be trustworthy and get stuff done.” Not all the mentors have left the building. For each new face on this year’s team, there’s an experienced player to show them the ropes. Faheem Delane, a star safety who will suit up for Ohio State next fall, anchors the secondary. Gavin Crawford and Eidan Buchanon are West Virginia-bound offensive linemen able to give Rice time to get the ball to weapons such as future Pittsburgh wideout DaMarion Fowlkes. Linebacker Justin Thompson, also a Pitt commit, has been a steady presence in the middle, and defensive linemen Delano Brown (Coastal Carolina) and Donovan Moyer (Arkansas State) are disruptive up front. All of them once looked to older teammates for answers. Now it’s their turn to pay it forward. “I was kind of thrust into a position where I have to be the more vocal guy and I have to lead everything. So it’s just good to see the responsibility I have, and I feel I can do that,” said Crawford. “We lost a lot of guys, obviously, but we’re working hard to make sure that people who you may not know their name, you’ll know their names after this season.” The Falcons are coalescing through a trial by fire, a process that traces back to grueling strength and conditioning sessions in the offseason. The season-opening win was a strong start, but there will be no reprieve when the Falcons leave the state again this weekend to play DePaul Catholic (N.J.) on Friday night. Four more nonconference games follow. After that, the Falcons will test themselves against one of the nation’s toughest leagues as WCAC play begins. In league play, especially, there will be nowhere for the Falcons’ new starters to hide. After all, the team has a title to defend. “The standard here is ‘We’re better than you, and we’re here to dominate,’” Delane said. “That’s the model we had last year, and we’re trying to pass that on.”",
