  "text": "Frankland Gets a Double Knockout The table were joking with Vladimir Korzinin to move all in blind with his remaining 111,000 chips, saying \"you don't want to be sat around on dinner break\" after he already doubled up going all in blind in the last level. Korzinin moved his stack into the middle before the cards were dealt and action started with Mikael Thuritz, who limped from under the gun. Mathew Frankland also limped from his direct left, and Korzinin was already all in from a middle position. Action folded around to Thuritz, who jammed, putting himself at risk. Frankland snap called. Vladimir Korzinin: 5♦3♦ Mikael Thuritz: K♠K♦ Mathew Frankland: A♦Q♠ Thuritz was ahead pre-flop, but not for long, as the dealer placed the 10♣A♥8♦ on the board, putting Frankland ahead with a pair of aces. Korzinin had some diamond flush draw outs, but these diminished on the Q♣ turn, which only improved Frankland further. Thuritz was looking for a jack, but the 3♠ river secured the win for Frankland. Both Thuritz and Korzinin bust in the last hand before the dinner break. |Jogador||Fichas||Oscilação| | |",
