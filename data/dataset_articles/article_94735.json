  "text": "(The Center Square) – The Tennessee Titans have been valued at anywhere from $4.9 billion to $6 billion recently, more than a 10% rise from last year. The Nashville-based franchise is owned by Amy Adams Strunk and is currently in the process of building a new Nissan Stadium next to the current Nissan Stadium using $1.27 billion in public funds while gathering an estimated [$3.1 billion in captured taxes](https://www.thecentersquare.com/tennessee/article_f0ddf3a4-dac9-11ed-8759-97fb8c8dc3f5.html) during the life of the new lease. The Titans ranked 23rd of the NFL’s 32 teams in value by both Forbes and CNBC. Forbes valued the Titans at [$4.9 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/justinteitelbaum/2024/08/29/the-nfls-most-valuable-teams-2024/), up 11% from a year before, while CNBC valued the franchise at [$6.0 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/05/official-nfl-team-valuations-2024.html). Both rankings had the Dallas Cowboys as the first NFL franchise valued at more than $10 billion. The Adams family purchased the Titans franchise, then the Houston Oilers, for $25,000 in 1959. The team had an estimated $521 million in revenue in 2022. The NFL reportedly earned more than [$13 billion](https://www.thecentersquare.com/tennessee/article_2d944d14-3e0d-11ef-a9c8-9bc765b5ef40.html) and distributed more than $400 million in 2023 to each team from national revenue.",
