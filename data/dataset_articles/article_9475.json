The meeting focused on strategies to address the evolving flood situation.\nAdditionally, to ensure uninterrupted medical services during emergencies, an army medical team has held a coordination meeting with the Civil Surgeon of Feni district.\nThe Bangladesh Army reaffirmed its commitment to stand beside the people during times of national crisis.\nFor necessary assistance, citizens are encouraged to contact the Flood Monitoring Cell at the Feni Deputy Commissioner’s office via the following helpline numbers: 01898-444500 and 01336-586693.",
