  "text": "Nathan Martorella put together arguably his best month as a minor league professional baseball player, earning Player of the Month honors for the Pensacola Blue Wahoos.\nThe 2019 Herald Male Athlete of the Year hit seven home runs and knocked in 16 runs in August for the Miami Marlins Double A affiliate, compiling a .983 on-base percentage/slugging percentage.\nTraded by the Padres to the Marlins in May, the left-handed hitting first baseman has hit 14 home runs and driven in 47 runs, with 45 walks and 96 hits this summer in his first full season of Double A baseball.\nDrafted in the fifth round by the Padres in 2022 out of Cal, Berkeley, the Salinas High graduate has hit 36 homers and driven in 156 runs at three different minor league levels.\nThe 23-year-old Martorella, who is five homers shy of matching his career high, is hitting .250 with a .345 on-base percentage in the minors.\nThe 6-foot-2 Martorella earned all-county honors at Salinas in football and baseball, and was an all-Pac 12 selection during his junior season at Cal in 2019.",
