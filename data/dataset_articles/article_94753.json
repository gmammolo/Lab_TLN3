  "text": "PARIS, Sept 4 (Reuters) – Para-cycling road racing swept the Paris Paralympic Games on Wednesday, with France claiming 11 of the day’s 12 medals in time trials.\nFrance has 50 medals, including 15 gold.\nThere were four of them who won the Paralympic title on Wednesday: Alexandre Léauté, Kévin Le Cunff, Thomas Peyroton-Dartet and Mathieu Bosredon.\nAccustomed to gold medals on the track, Alexandre Léauté won his first title on the road in the C2 category. He now has seven Paralympic medals, including three gold. The Breton will have the opportunity on Saturday in the C1-3 road race to win a fourth medal at these Paris Games.\nKévin Le Cunff took his revenge on his teammate Gatien Le Rousseau. Beaten for bronze last Saturday by his compatriot, he this time beat him in a nice French double in the C4 category to win his first medal in these Paris Games, the second gold of his career.\nThe French achieved another double in the H3 category with Mathieu Bosredon’s first Paralympic title ahead of Johan Quaile, silver medalist for his first Games.\nThomas Peyroton-Dartet reached his first Paralympic podium, and on the top step, dominating the C3 time trial.\nIn addition to Gatien Le Rousseau and Johan Quaile, three other Frenchmen were awarded silver: Heïdi Gaugain in category C5, Elie de Carvalho (with his guide Mickaël Guichard) in category B and Loïc Vergnaud in category H5.\nFinally, Florian Jouanny and Dorian Foulon won bronze, respectively in the H2 and C5 categories.\nThe only medal on Wednesday that was not won by para road cycling was won by para table tennis. Defeated in the MS2 singles semi-final by the Czech Jiri Suchanek (3-1), Fabien Lamirault had to settle for the bronze medal, distributed to the two losers in the last four.\nA member of the quintet that lit the cauldron at the opening ceremony, Fabien Lamirault was the double title holder in his category.
