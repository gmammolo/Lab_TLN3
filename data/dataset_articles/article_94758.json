  "text": "BRIGHTON — Joonas Korpisalo needed a fresh start after an ugly 2023-24 season that saw the goalie go 21-26-4 with a 3.27 goals-against average and an .890 save percentage for the Ottawa Senators. But now he finds himself in Boston after being acquired by the Bruins in a deal that sent Linus Ullmark to Ottawa.\nWhile the trade was a surprise to Korpisalo, he’s excited to get to work with his new teammates.\n“Things happen for a reason, and I’m here,” Korpisalo said after Thursday’s captains’ practice at Warrior Ice Arena. “Now I’m super excited.”\nKorpisalo was statistically one of the NHL’s worst goalies last season. It wasn’t solely on him, though, and he’s not far removed from a successful stint with the Los Angeles Kings when he amassed a .921 save percentage in 11 games.\n“It happens,” Korpisalo said of his numbers last year. “Everyone did their best and sometimes it just doesn’t work out. Certainly, it wasn’t that no one tried enough. But that’s last season and we got a new season coming up.”\nWith Ullmark in Ottawa , that leaves on spot behind Jeremy Swayman up for grabs. The Bruins have Brandon Bussi in Providence, and he’s knocking on the door of an NHL debut. Korpisalo doesn’t know what his workload will entail during the 2024-25 season, noting that’s a question for the coaches. But he has been in contact with goalie coach Bob Essensa.\n“I’m really excited to see Bob. ... and see what’s on his mind to make my game better. We’ve been calling (each other) a lot,” he said. “He’s not here yet. We’ve been catching up with each other throughout the summer. Excited to meet him.”\nLast season is behind him and Korpisalo is only looking ahead to the future. It will be an interesting training camp for both him and Bussi — especially after general manager Don Sweeney said in June that he’s not ruling anything out when it comes to the backup goalie.\nMore Bruins content Bruins newcomer excited to play with star forward Devils sign former Bruins defenseman Two Bruins prospects make college decisions Eastern Conference team denies report of signing Milan Lucic If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
