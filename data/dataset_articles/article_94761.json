  "text": "If the Chiefs are playing, chances are Taylor Swift is in the stands and that's a very good thing for Kansas City fans. By Ian Levy | 3:36 PM EDT\nSuper Bowl LVIII - San Francisco 49ers v Kansas City Chiefs / Ezra Shaw/GettyImages\nTaylor Swift became an indelible part of the NFL experience last season, as her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce completely jumped the shark . They began dating early in the season and he presence at Chiefs games throughout the season brought plenty of new fans and attention to what was already the most popular sport in the US.\nWhile some fans may have been exhausted by all the shots of her in the stands and the repeated predictions of whether or not she would be in attendance each week, she was clearly good for the game and, you could argue, pretty good for the Chiefs.\nWhich Chiefs games did Taylor Swift attend in 2023? Swift attended 13 Chiefs games during the 2023 season, and more often than not, she was there for a Chiefs win.\nDATE\nOPPONENT\nRESULT\nSept. 24, 2023\nvs. Bears\nW, 41-10\nOct. 1, 2023\nat Jets\nW, 23-20\nOct. 12, 2023\nvs. Broncos\nW, 19-8\nOct. 22, 2023\nvs. Chargers\nW, 31-17\nDec. 3, 2023\nat Packers\nL, 27-19\nDec. 10, 2023\nvs. Bills\nL, 20-17\nDec. 17, 2023\nat Patriots\nW, 27-17\nDec. 25, 2023\nvs. Raiders\nL, 20-14\nDec. 31, 2023\nvs. Bengals\nW, 25-17\nJan. 13, 2024\nvs. Dolphins\nW, 26-7\nJan. 21, 2024\nat Bills\nW, 27-24\nJan. 28, 2024\nat Ravens\nW, 17-10\nFeb. 11, 2024\nvs. 49ers\nW, 25-22\nIn all, the Chiefs were 10-3 last season in games attended by Swift, outscoring opponents by a total of 92 points. They were 5-2 in home games attended by Swift and 5-1 in road or neutral site games. From the time she attended her first game and their relationship was underway, she missed just five games of a possible 18 games.\nIt goes without saying but they were much better off when she was there, going just 1-3 in the four games she did not attend last season.\nWill Taylor Swift be at Chiefs 2024 season-opener? According to The Athletic, Taylor Swift will be in attendance on Thursday, Sept. 5 as the Chiefs unveil their championship banner and begin their quest for a three-pear against the Baltimore Ravens.\nTaylor Swift’s Chiefs era is continuing.\nThe pop star will attend Thursday’s NFL season opener between Kansas City and the Baltimore Ravens to cheer on her boyfriend and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, a source tells The Athletic.\nMore ⤵️ https://t.co/xRFXfjkLCJ\n— The Athletic (@TheAthletic) September 5, 2024 Swift is also likely to be in the stands for much of the early portion of the Chiefs schedule with a break in her Eras Tour schedule until Oct. 18 when she resumes in Miami. She'll be playing more than a dozen dates in North America across the rest of October, November and into December but even then she should be able to catch a handful of games in person.\nWhich 2024 Chiefs games will Taylor Swift be at? DATE\nCHIEFS GAME LOCATION\nTAYLOR TOUR LOCATION\nSept. 5\nHome vs. Ravens\n-\nSept. 15\nHome vs. Bengals\n-\nSept. 22\nat Atlanta Falcons\n-\nSept. 29\nat Los Angeles Chargers\n-\nOct. 7\nHome vs. Saints\n-\nOct. 20\nat San Francisco 49ers\nMiami\nOct. 27\nat Las Vegas Raiders\nNew Orleans\nNov. 4\nHome vs. Buccaneers\nIndianapolis (Nov. 3)\nNov. 10\nHome vs. Broncos\n-\nNov. 17\nat Buffalo Bills\nToronto (Nov. 16)\nNov. 24\nat Carolina Panthers\nToronto (Nov. 23)\nNov. 29\nHome vs. Raiders\n-\nDec. 8\nHome vs. Chargers\nVancouver\nDec. 15\nat Cleveland Browns\n-\nDec. 21\nHome vs. Texans\n-\nDec. 25\nat Pittsburgh Steelers\n-\nJan. 5\nat Denver Broncos\n-\nTaylor Swift's current tour dates only overlap with the Chiefs schedule on three dates — Week 7 when the Chiefs are in San Francisco and Taylor is in Miami, Week 8 when the Chiefs in Las Vegas and she's in New Orleans and Week 14 when the Chiefs are in Kansas City and she's in Vancouver.\nIn addition, there are there other dates where the Chiefs play and she has a concert the day before and might not be able to make it. Of those, Week 11 is the most likely option for her to attend, coming off a show in Toronto with the Chiefs playing right across Lake Ontario in Buffalo.\nAssuming the relationship lasts and assuming she doesn't get tired of watching the Chiefs pound their opponents each week, Swift could be in attendance for as many as 13 games this season. If that works out like it did last year — 10-3 record in those games and a run through the playoffs — the average Chiefs fan should be very happy.\nfeed\nRelated Topics Kansas NFL News Kansas City Chiefs Baltimore Ravens Home / Kansas City Chiefs",
