  "text": "Soaking-up the excitement: DHS swimmers ready to dive into 2024 season\nNew Dickinson High coach encourages positive energy, teamwork, ‘family’ vibes\nDICKINSON — The excitement continues to build on the pool deck for the Dickinson Midgets’ girls swim and dive team as they have their first meet on Saturday, Sept. 7 for the Capital City Invite in Bismarck.\nThe Midgets will be competing against six high schools at the BSC Aquatic and Wellness Center in 12 different races: three relays, one diving event and six individual races. The top-16 swimmers will score points.\nA big storyline heading into the 2024 season for DHS is the beginning of the Amy Smith era. Smith was named the new head coach of the Midgets back in July, taking over for Jenna Wolf after eight seasons at the helm.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPractices at the West River Community Center have been energetic and exciting, according to Smith, and swimmers have fed off her positive energy and mindset while adjusting to the changes she has made.\n“I think with change there can be some challenges, but the girls have been very positive throughout each week, and have embraced trying some new things throughout practice,” Smith said. “I see them encourage each other and cheer each other on and also push each other during practice.”\nWhile Smith has a plethora of experience coaching at the high-school level, there will be an adjustment period for her as she has not been on the pool deck in quite some time. Throughout her career as a swimmer and coach, one value instilled in her has remained constant: Work together as one big family.\n“I think that there's still a few things that I need to learn, as far as what all comes with the meets, but the swimming environment stays the same and the competition level stays the same,” Smith said. “I think some of the pieces that we've been talking about is that we're all in this together. We are one swim family. We're here to support each other and cheer each other on and be a positive light in every person on our team.”\nLast season, the Midgets came in fourth in the WDA championship and seventh in the state meet. However, they made some history last season. Senior Taylor Miller broke the 100m freestyle school record with a time of 54.67 and is looking to break another record in her final season as a Midget.\nShe will be participating in the 100-free again but will be competing in the 200m individual-medley, the 200m free relay and the 400m free relay.\nThe Capital City Invite kicks off at 10 a.m. MDT at the BSC Aquatic and Wellness Center.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT",
