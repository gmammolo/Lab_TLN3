  "text": "Ghana head coach Otto Addo insists there are “a lot of positives” to take from their defeat to Angola in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.\nThe Black Stars began their campaign on a disappointing note, conceding a late goal from Milson that secured Angola all three points at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium.\nThe outcome was Ghana’s first loss in Kumasi in 24 years.\nThe result leaves the senior national team in third place, with Angola and Sudan occupying the first and second spots in Group F, respectively.\n“We lost today but we have to look at the chances we allowed and not just the goal we conceded,” Addo said.\n“I said it the last time, defense starts in attack so we need to press, be a bit more compact and work harder.\n“The second half makes me very confident. The good thing is that it is still in our hands. We’ve still got games against all the teams in the group so we just have to do our job. There were a lot of positives to be taken from this, we should’ve taken our chances.\nThe Black Stars will hope to bounce back in their next encounter against Niger on Monday, September 9.",
