  "text": "Another stone fell into place after Cal Poly Humboldt and College of the Redwoods launched their plans to introduce rodeo teams to both schools earlier this summer — College of the Redwoods announced their two head coaches on Tuesday, hiring Gianna and Kelly O’Day.\nThe Corsairs brought on the husband and wife duo to ignite the Corsairs rodeo program, with both O’Days being local rodeo riders.\n“The local rodeo community all agreed that Kelly and Gianna were the coaches we needed to secure here at CR,” Ryan Bisio, College of the Redwoods assistant athletic director, said in Tuesday’s release. “Kelly and Gianna’s longstanding connections to local and regional rodeo folks, along with their expertise in successful rodeo programs, will benefit us tremendously.”\nKelly O’Day competed on a college rodeo team while attending Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, competing in the National College Finals twice before moving on to professional rodeo, where he won the Brawley Rodeo in 2016. Coaching isn’t new for the O’Days, with Kelly already serving as an assistant coach on the Ferndale High School football team while also being an agriculture teacher at the school. Both CR and Cal Poly Humboldt will use the facilities at the Ferndale fairgrounds for practice.\n“Since I’ve started teaching, I have taken a step back from rodeo, and now that we have accepted this opportunity, I am looking forward to getting back involved in the sport that has defined me for many years,” Kelly O’Day said in the release.\nGianna O’Day has participated in rodeo events at the junior high, high school, collegiate and professional levels. O’Day also attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, coming back from an injury in her freshman season where she lost her right thumb tying up a horse. The injury didn’t stop her as she continued her rodeo career and has qualified for the California Circuit Finals for the past two years.\n“I am excited to keep rodeo and the cowboy culture alive in Ferndale and the Humboldt County community,” Gianna O’Day said in the school’s release. “I have always enjoyed coaching young adults and look forward to the challenge of developing a rodeo program with my husband at CR.”\nBoth the Corsairs and the ‘Jacks will begin their rodeo programs this fall, just a few months after the colleges announced the sport’s introduction.\n“Bringing rodeo to CR has long been a goal of mine, and I believe the O’Days are the perfect team to help us achieve this vision,” College of the Redwoods President Keith Flamer said in the release. “I am also excited about the opportunities this presents for working with Cal Poly Humboldt to strengthen our connections through our new rodeo programs.”\nCorsairs’ wrestling readies for another season After bringing back the College of the Redwoods’ wrestling program in 2023, head coach Brandon Benvenuti and his athletes are ready for year two, which opens up Friday for the men’s team with a free to attend Cardinal vs. Gold inter-squad match Friday night at 5:30 p.m. in the CR gym.\nThe men’s team finished 12th in the CCCAA state championships last year, an impressive start for the program that was previously dormant for over four decades.\nFollowing Friday’s scrimmage, the season will begin officially later this month with the Sac City Invitational on Sept. 21. After that is the first of four home meets, with the Sierra College Duel on Oct. 2.\nDyaln McNeill can be reached at 707-441-0526.",
