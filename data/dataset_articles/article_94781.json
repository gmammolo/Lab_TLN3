  "text": "Japan made a rampant start to the decisive third round of Asian qualifying for the 2026 World Cup by hammering China 7-0 on Thursday but Australia suffered a shock home defeat by Bahrain. In other action, Palestine earned a deserved point with a 0-0 draw away at South Korea as they attempt to reach the World Cup for the first time. Premier League stars Kaoru Mitoma and Wataru Endo both scored as Japan taught a hapless China a lesson in Saitama. Brighton winger Mitoma, who has missed a chunk of this year with injury, was making his first appearance for Japan since the Asian Cup in January. He announced his return in emphatic style in front of more than 50,000 fans, scoring with a first-half header after Liverpool’s Endo had given Japan the lead. “The home support was overwhelming and that allowed us to play well from the first whistle,” Mitoma said. Takumi Minamino added two more goals after the break to put Japan on cruise control against a China side looking to qualify for their first World Cup since 2002. It was a night to forget for China, who squeezed into the third qualifying round thanks only to a superior head-to-head record over Thailand. Also in Group C, Bahrain stunned Australia 1-0 on the Gold Coast thanks to an 89th-minute Harry Souttar own goal. With the hosts down to 10 men, the match was headed for a scoreless draw until the defender deflected a shot into his own net. The Socceroos struggled for fluency against their defensively minded opponents and their hopes nosedived after a red card in the 77th minute to striker Kusini Yengi for a high kick. “It’s a learning curve for the players. It wasn’t our night,” Australia coach Graham Arnold said. Roberto Mancini’s Saudi Arabia were held to a surprise 1-1 draw in their Group C opener at home to Indonesia, a team ranked 77 spots below them. The visitors took the lead when Ragnar Oratmangoen deflected the ball past goalkeeper Mohammed Al-Owais in the 19th minute. Musab Al-Juwayr’s own deflected strike in first-half stoppage time then levelled matters. Salem Al-Dawsari squandered a golden opportunity to put the Saudis ahead 12 minutes from time when his penalty was saved by Indonesia goalkeeper Maarten Paes. Uzbekistan edged North Korea 1-0 in Tashkent in the opening game in Group A. The top two from each of the three Asian groups will be guaranteed a place at the expanded 48-team World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The third qualifying round wraps up in June. Palestine earn point At the 66,000-capacity Seoul World Cup Stadium in Group B, Palestine gave South Korea a major scare in an entertaining goalless stalemate. Making their debut in the third stage of Asian qualifying and 96th in FIFA’s rankings to South Korea’s 23rd, Palestine refused to be overawed for much of an open contest. Palestine play their home matches abroad, usually in the Middle East, because of the war in Gaza. The local league has been suspended and many of the players are without a club. Despite those obstacles, they were good value for the draw. Palestine thought they had taken the lead in the 22nd minute, only for the goal to be correctly ruled out for offside. Oday Dabbagh went close for the visitors on the break in the second half, before Spurs star Son Heung-min rattled the outside of the Palestine post in the dying minutes. The away side could have won it themselves late on but goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo saved South Korea from an embarrassing defeat. Palestine face Jordan on Tuesday in Kuala Lumpur in what is nominally a home match. Also in Group B, Iraq opened their account with a 1-0 victory at home against Oman in Basra. Asian Cup runners-up Jordan saw victory snatched from their grasp in injury-time as Kuwait earned a 1-1 draw at Amman International Stadium in the other game in the group. Meanwhile, Asian champions Qatar let slip a 1-0 lead at home to the UAE to lose 3-1 in Group A. Ibrahim Al-Hassan had put the hosts in front seven minutes before half-time at Al Rayyan Stadium, but Paulo Bento’s side rallied late in the second half through goals from Harib Abdalla, Khaled Al-Dhanhani and substitute Ali Saleh. In Group A’s other match, perennial World Cup qualifiers Iran defeated Kyrgyzstan 1-0 in Fuladshahr, with Inter Milan striker Mehdi Taremi getting the game’s only goal just after the half-hour.",
