  "text": "Slick Angelo Stiller rising in style with VfB Stuttgart and Germany VfB Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller is loving life right now. A nailed-on starter for the Swabians, the 23-year-old recently celebrated his club's second-placed Bundesliga finish and a senior Germany call up. With a trip to Real Madrid to come in the UEFA Champions League, things could be worse for the no-nonsense No. 6. \"In midfield we have to replace two players who have retired: [Ilkay Gündogan](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/ilkay-gundogan-made-in-borussia-dortmund-manchester-city-nuremberg-schalke-5979) and [Toni Kroos](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/toni-kroos-real-madrid-bayern-munich-germany-made-in-bundesliga-5841). Angelo [Stiller](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/player/angelo-stiller), who performed very well in [Stuttgart](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/clubs/vfb-stuttgart) last season and again now, is the only new addition to the squad.\" The praise could barely have been any higher than that which Germany coach [Julian Nagelsmann](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/why-julian-nagelsmann-perfect-fit-germany-head-coach-euro-2024-24832) bestowed on Stiller when calling the Munich native up for the UEFA Nations League games against Hungary and the Netherlands. A chance to make his senior international bow after several seasons with the Germany set-up at youth and Under-21 level, Stuttgart's mature-beyond-his years defensive midfielder is set to be in elite company with his international step up. Speaking ahead of his country's upcoming fixtures, new Germany captain and seasoned [Bayern Munich](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/clubs/fc-bayern-muenchen) star [Joshua Kimmich](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/player/joshua-kimmich) said of Stiller and compatriot [Aleksandar Pavlović](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/player/aleksandar-pavlovic), \"Both have been developed in intense environments. It’s clear that Angelo is confident, just like Pavlo. Both are technically strong and have a good passing game, and you can tell with both of them that they want to play football. It’s important to have young players who are hungry and just enjoy playing.\" Stiller has clearly been enjoying his arrival to the big time. A Bayern youth-team player who excelled under current Stuttgart tactician [Sebastian Hoeneß](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/sebastian-hoeness-who-is-the-bayern-munich-reserve-team-coach-stuttgart-12046) in the junior ranks of the Bavarian giants, Stiller moved to [Hoffenheim](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/clubs/tsg-hoffenheim) to join his former boss in Sinsheim, before the pair were once again reunited at the MHPArena. \"We have a history together for a long time; he is a great player,\" Hoeneß told bundesliga.com. \"He absolutely deserves to play for the national team. He's a really important factor in our team, so I'm convinced he will play a big role also in the national team in the coming years. That is why I'm really happy for him,\" the 42-year-old added. The news of Stiller's first call-up to Germany's seniors was welcomed with equal praise from his fellow Stuttgart - and now Germany - teammate [Deniz Undav](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/player/deniz-undav). \"I'm really happy for him; when I heard the news I was really happy for him because he deserves the opportunity to come to the national team,\" Undav told bundesliga.com. \"I think he is one of the best number sixes Germany has, so we will see what happens. I hope just the best for him and I hope he will enjoy the time.\" Words of praise from all quarters have been flowing towards the player who featured in all but three of Stuttgart's Bundesliga games last term, when he scored a goal and provided five assists in a memorable campaign for VfB. Yet, not one to get caught up in the praise, Stiller is determined to remain focused on his task as one of the division's best in class. \"I’m not the type to get carried away,\" he informed bundesliga.com recently. \"It’s always nice for any player to hear nice things about you, but it can quickly go the other way as well, so you enjoy it, you soak it up, but you don’t get carried away.\" A slight blip in domestic form for [Die Schwaben](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/german-soccer-dictionary-meaning-definition-translation-term-phrase-2773-1262) saw them narrowly [miss out on Supercup glory](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/bayer-leverkusen-vfb-stuttgart-supercup-preview-live-blog-report-alonso-28479) against Bundesliga champions [Bayer Leverkusen](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/clubs/bayer-04-leverkusen) and pick up just one point from their opening two top-flight games in 2024/25. Yet Stiller insists that Stuttgart and Hoeneß will be staying true to their style when the team returns to action following the international break. \"If you look at how we play football, you can see we’re a bit different to other clubs,\" the player explained. \"We want to play attractive, good football. We also play brave football, and I think that’s really important for us and for [the coach].\" Watch: Stuttgart's incredible 2023/24 campaign That bravery will be called upon when Stuttgart [start their Champions League adventure](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/2024-25-champions-league-europa-draw-fixtures-results-bayern-dortmund-leverkusen-28553) this month. Following a Matchday 3 encounter against [Borussia Mönchengladbach](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/clubs/borussia-moenchengladbach) in the Bundesliga, Stiller and his teammates travel to Spain to face European champions Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu. Asked what it will mean to him to feature in European club football's elite competition for the first time, Stiller explained, “It's the biggest thing for any footballer, and if I can play for my club, for VfB, in a competition like that, it’s huge.” Getting used to life on the biggest stages seems fitting for a footballer of Stiller’s unquestionable talents.
