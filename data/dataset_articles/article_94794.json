  "text": "GGF FOOTBALL THIS WEEK: East Grand Forks ready for test against Little Falls Newly No. 1 Grand Forks Red River has a bye week while Central plays at Bismarck St. Mary's GRAND FORKS — A frustrating theme for the East Grand Forks Senior High football program a season ago was a string of one-score losses. As the 2024 Green Wave look to flip some of those results, one of those opportunities sits a three-and-a-half hour bus ride away this Friday. East Grand Forks travels to Little Falls for a 6 p.m. Week 2 matchup. ADVERTISEMENT The Flyers beat the Green Wave 15-14 in East Grand Forks last season after the Wave missed a late game-winning field goal. How can East Grand Forks flip some of those one-score results from a year ago? \"I think a lot of it is in practice, talking about those things,\" Wave coach Ryan Kasowski said. \"Telling the guys, hey, we're close. What is going to get us over the edge? We harp on those things and make sure we continue to get better every day we come here.\" The Wave opened a promising 2024 last week with a 41-8 win over Crookston in which East Grand Forks led 27-0 after the first quarter and let off the gas. Jakob Stassen, taking over at starting quarterback for three-year starter Drew Carpenter, was 3-for-4 for 81 yards in his debut with an interception. \"I'm very encouraged with Jake,\" Kasowski said. \"The team believes in him, and he can make plays. He threw an interception he'd like to take back. But he does a great job learning and understanding from his mistakes.\" The Wave also saw big plays from skill players in 2024 elevated roles in Jordan Nowacki, Austin Rusling and Cole Schmiedeberg. ADVERTISEMENT Three of Nowacki's four touches against Crookston went for touchdowns. \"It's exciting,\" Kasowski said. \"I think we have multiple guys we can get it to back there. (Nowacki and Schmiedeberg) have explosiveness and hard-nose running. Every time they touch it, they can score. As the season goes on, we hope we can get even more guys carries. It makes your offense more dynamic that way.\" Little Falls lost 36-30 to Pierz in Week 1. The Flyers return a talented quarterback in left-hander Gavin Anderson, who threw for 98 yards against EGF last season. He had 155 yards in Week 1. Trent Roden and Joey Welinkski were Little Falls' top skill players in Week 1. The Flyers' dynamic receiver of 2023, Isaac Olson, is now a freshman on the Northern Michigan football team. Mahnomen-Waubun at Polk County West Polk County West doesn't have it easy as the Thunder hope to bounce back from a season-opening loss. PCW, who lost 38-12 at West Central in Week 1, face annual power Mahnomen-Waubun at 7 p.m. Friday in Climax. Mahnomen-Waubun opened the year with a 41-6 victory against Benson. ADVERTISEMENT \"They're the No. 1 team until someone proves different,\" PCW coach Darrin Byklum said. \"We'll have to come ready to roll. The boys usually step up to this challenge. We'll see what kind of growth we have.\" Byklum said his team struggled early before settling in last week. \"We spotted them three touchdowns,\" he said. \"Once we got things straightened out, it wasn't a perfect game, but at least it was a game. We have to play a full four quarters.\" The Thunder were paced last week by senior running back Sawyer Horken, who had eight carries for 44 yards and a touchdown, along with three catches for 60 yards and a score. Quarterback Will Zavarol was 5-for-7 for 87 yards and a touchdown. Mahnomen-Waubun was a balanced, methodical rushing attack in its approach in Week 1. Quarterback Blake McMullen threw for just 11 yards but ran for three touchdowns and 56 yards on eight carries. Mahnomen-Waubun ran for 278 yards at nearly 6.0 yards per carry. ADVERTISEMENT GF Central at Bismarck St. Mary's As Grand Forks Central works through replacing much of the program's now-graduated offensive production from 2023, Knights coach Jake Schauer is hoping to diversify his options entering this Friday's 7 p.m. kickoff at Bismarck St. Mary's. Central lost 34-9 to Jamestown in its season opener with Naz Fisher (10 carries, 66 yards), Logan Vorhies (3 catches, 38 yards) and Noah Lease (49 yards passing) leading the charge. \"I consider Jamestown a Top 3 team, and they're always in the playoffs,\" Schauer said of Week 1 impressions. \"It's a really good measuring stick. When we were up 9-7, I was really optimistic. I thought, this team could have the grit to hang around. Well, the wheels fell off and it showed our youth. We have more kids out for Central football but only six seniors. At the end of the day, I was still encouraged. The guys will learn how to play. It's on us as coaches to coach them up, then up to them to soak it in. \"I think we have six or seven guys I trust with the ball in their hands. One thing I took away was we had some guys who didn't get the ball enough. We need to diversify. We have receivers like Zade Martin, Brooklan Bruce, Trey Clausen and Kyden Murph. They're capable. It's up to us to scheme things up to get them the ball.\" St. Mary's enters the matchup 0-1 after losing 41-7 to Grand Forks Red River at Cushman Field last Friday. Charles Richter ran for 45 yards and threw for 19 to pace St. Mary's, which is in its first season of Class AA football after playing a Class AAA schedule in previous seasons. GF Red River vs. bye Grand Forks Red River climbed to a No. 1 ranking in Class AA this week, but the Roughriders won't be putting the ranking to any test this weekend.
