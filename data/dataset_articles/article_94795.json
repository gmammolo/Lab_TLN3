  "text": "Argentina have brought back the veteran second-row duo of Tomas Lavanini and Guido Petti to strengthen their forward power for Saturday&apos;s Rugby Championship clash against Australia in Santa Fe. Coach Felipe Contepomi on Thursday announced four changes in the starting line-up to the team who lost 20-19 against the Wallabies in La Plata last Saturday, when Argentina gave away a late penalty and were beaten by a last-gasp kick. Petti and Lavanini both came off the bench last weekend as Argentina struggled to dominate the set pieces and rucks in rainy conditions. It was Petti&apos;s first Test for Argentina this year and his return to the starting line-up comes at the expense of Franco Molina while Lavanini replaces Pedro Rubiolo, who suffered a concussion in the opening minute of last weekend&apos;s match. Reliable kicker Santiago Carreras is replaced at flyhalf by Tomas Albornoz while Bautista Delguy comes in on the right wing in place of Santiago Cordero in the other changes for a fourth match in this year&apos;s southern hemisphere championship for both teams. Saturday&apos;s Test in Santa Fe will mark Argentina skipper Julian Montoya&apos;s 100th cap. Gonzalo Garcia keeps his place as backup scrumhalf after Lautaro Bazan Velez picked up an injury in the warm-up last Saturday. Argentina surprised with a call-up this week for 35-year-old Tomas Cubelli, who looked to be the preferred cover for first choice Gonzalo Bertranou. But no sooner had Cubelli joined the camp he suffered a muscle strain. Argentina and Australia have both lost two of their opening three matches in this year&apos;s competition. Argentina: Juan Cruz Mallia, Bautista Delguy, Lucio Cinti, Santiago Chocobares, Mateo Carreras, Tomas Albornoz, Gonzalo Bertranou, Juan Martin Gonzalez, Marcos Kremer, Pablo Matera, Tomas Lavanini, Replacements: Ignacio Ruiz, Mayco Vivas, Eduardo Bello, Franco Molina, Joaquin Oviedo, Santiago Grondona, Gonzalo Garcia, Santiago Carreras.",
