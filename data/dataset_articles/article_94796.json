  "text": "[Nueva Ecija](https://www.spin.ph/tag/nueva-ecija) battered South Cotabato, 94-75, on Friday in Season 6 of the [Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League (MPBL)](https://www.spin.ph/tag/mpbl) at the Orion Sports Complex in Bataan. Powered by [Robby Celiz](https://www.spin.ph/tag/robby-celiz), the Rice Vanguards led by as many as 77-52 early in the fourth quarter and never wavered en route to their 21st win against 3 losses in the round-robin elimination phase of the 29-team tournament. Celiz posted 20 points, six rebounds and rebounds assists to clinch best player honors over MJ Ayaay with 13 points and Jay Collado who finished with 12 points. Kenneth Mocon and JC Cullar added 10 points each for the 2022 MPBL champions. South Cotabato got 12 points each from Chris Dumapig and Jervy Cruz as they dropped to 15-11. Jammer Jamito grabbed 15 rebounds as South Cotabato ruled the boards, 50-37. Nueva Ecija, however, compensated with a high 53.7 field goal percentage (27 of 44) against South Cotabato's 32.4 percent (15 of 33) to stay within sight of North Division pacesetters San Juan (23-1) and Pampanga (24-2). Earlier, Quezon Province dumped Muntinlupa, 88-31 to climb to 19-5 and regain the top spot in the South Division. The Huskers held the Muntinlupa Cagers to an all-time low of three points in the second quarter and pulled down their victims to 7-19. Homegrown icon Topeng Lagrama led the Huskers with 16 points, highlighted by a perfect 4 of 4 triple shooting, followed by Gab Banal with 11 points, 10 rebounds and three steals. Judel Fuentes and Rodel Gravera added 10 points apiece. The elimination round takes a break to give way for the MPBL All-Star Game on Sept. 7 in Zamboanga City.
