  "text": "Quick Trips Trading hiking trails for indoor climbing gym in Nuremberg offers boulder blast Stars and Stripes September 5, 2024 Trying to find an activity that satiates my need for outdoor adventure becomes difficult as the cooler months in Bavaria approach, so I’ve been increasingly looking to indoor spots. Boulderhalle E4, a climbing gym in the heart of Nuremberg, was exactly what I had in mind. With more than 32,000 square feet of intricate walls, it’s one of the largest bouldering centers in the country, according to the company’s website. I decided to drag along a friend who also had minimal experience bouldering, and as two amateur climbers, we didn’t know what to expect. We were greeted by a pristine, modern gym with a small bistro. Tables and booths were set among the check-in area, with a shop carrying clothes and climbing gear. Staffers at E4 were very friendly as they helped us purchase a discounted day pass and rent the appropriate gear: a chalk bag and climbing shoes. They took care in explaining the seven beginner to expert grading levels we would come across, along with the safety measures. Color-coordinated tags identify the difficulty of the routes, which are changed every week. My friend and I settled on the intermediate courses and found them to be perfect for our skill level. While resting between climbs, I observed the range of patrons, from small groups of semiprofessional climbers traversing the most difficult routes to kids unloading their energy with their families. My friend and I spent about two hours at the gym. At one point, we wandered off to explore one of two upstairs training areas, where there were training walls, pull-up bars and TRX bands for more experienced climbers. After expending ourselves to the point of being unable to grasp another hold, we decided to call it a day and head to the bistro for some snacks. Although it didn’t have any to-go cups for coffee, I eyed a fridge with a few bottled beers and wines, which may have piqued my interest had it not been mid-morning on a Saturday. I settled on purchasing a few specialty protein bars for the one-hour drive home. Boulderhalle E4 offered an array of climbing challenges that I’m eager to visit again throughout the upcoming winter. It will definitely tide me over until the hiking trails beckon in the spring.
