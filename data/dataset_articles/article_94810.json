  "text": "NFL football is back, baby. Real, actual, non-vanilla preseason football — and we kick off with an absolute banger on Thursday night between the Chiefs and Ravens in what could be a preview of the AFC Championship game in four months’ time. The story entering Week 1 is nervousness. A lot of fans around the NFL know this could be the make-or-break season for the status quos, with organizations like the Jets, Falcons, and Cowboys (among others) needing to really show out in 2024 in order to move forward with things as is. Getting out to a solid start will do a lot to assuage fears among fans, and that makes this Week 1 critical in getting the ball rolling. It’s wild to imagine that we’re more or less bullish on the Bears now, but that’s what a No. 1 pick like Caleb Williams can do for you. Similarly there’s a lot of belief in the Texans (as expected) and they’ll now be looking to build off C.J. Stroud’s phenomenal rookie season and cement themselves in greatness. Here are our expect picks for every game in Week 1.",
