  "text": "Mini Flyweights Lulu Hawton vs Viviana Ruiz Fight in Australia Tiny Lulu “Bang, Bang” Hawton first conquered Australia and Asia and then moved to America and showed off her blazing fighting skills in numerous entertaining scraps. Then the Covid pandemic hit. Back to Australia she went with no fights in sight for more than four years. While many female fighters gained fame during the pandemic in Europe and America, Hawton was fight-less. Take heed, Bang, Bang is back. The former two-division world titlist Hawton (11-2) meets Viviana Ruiz (8-1) in a 10-round fight at the HBF Arena in Joondalup, Australia on Saturday Sept. 7. It’s near Perth on the western side of the country. Both have visions of a world title match. “Viviana is hungry chasing her shot at world title so she will come to fight,” said Hawton of her foe. Hawton spent two years in America fighting from minimumweight to flyweight and developed a large following of fans with her “bang,bang” style. She also participated in a spectacular shootout against Lorraine Villalobos that was televised by Showtime in 2019. After that fight Hawton returned to Australia and did not fight again in the prize ring until this past April in Thailand. “During this period, I also explored new opportunities, one of which was participating in the reality TV show The Summit,” said Hawton. “Additionally, my son Eli Hawton began boxing, and I dedicated a year to training him to ensure he developed a strong sense of the basic foundations.” She still works with her 17-year-old son and trains too. The perky Aussie had captured the WBO light flyweight title, the interim WBC atomweight title and seeks a fight with current undisputed minimumweight world champion Seniesa Estrada. It’s attainable. First, she must win against Ruiz this weekend. Hawton has plans aside from boxing. But boxing comes first. It’s been a long journey which began as a competitive skateboarder in her teens. She has a son now 17 and also competed in a reality television show. After getting into boxing she raced to the top with her mix of speed and power. “One of my favorite fights was in Japan for the WBO light fly world championship,” said Hawton who fought Kai Takenaka in August 2016 and won. “I clearly was the underdog going up in weight and taking on their home-grown champion.” After that win in Japan, she was stripped of the title for not defending it. For those fans that are unaware, a fighter or their manager or promoter must pay a sanctioning fee to hold their title. Defending a world title is costly. Hawton traveled to America and was immediately a fan favorite with her electric style and penchant for firing lightning blasts in her tiny frame. Though she lost twice to Mexican fighters she captivated and entertained fans each time. At age 39, she still has time. “My primary goal is to compete at the highest level and secure mega fights with top champions like undisputed champion Seniesa Estrada and Yokosta Valle,” said Hawton. “I’ve always dreamed of winning one of those ring belts. These are the kinds of fights that fans will love.” No time to waste. (Photo courtesy of Louisa Hawton)",
