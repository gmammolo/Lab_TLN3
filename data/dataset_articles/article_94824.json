He received a higher education in programming in Jurmala. “It was strange at first, but with time everyone gets used to it and, as they say, it was the children at school who adapted to me, and not the other way around. I was treated like other students,” Rihards says about his memories at school.\nWell, he is a Paralympic champion. How did it all start? “I started riding by accident. My grandparents wanted me to improve my health even more and there are stables near the house.” Initially he went to horses for about two years for reit therapy, which is a treatment method in which the horse is the main healer.\nAfter that he started doing more horse riding. “I became more independent and the coach noticed that I could do more, and that was it.”\nSnikus won silver medals in both disciplines with the “King of Dance” at the Tokyo Paralympic Games. After his success in this interview, he was modest, saying that he wished he had the same motivation as when he was a child, because he would have liked to be more successful. He was satisfied with his performance, but deep down he knew he could have done more.\nWell, he did it. On September 3, Snikus won the gold medal in the para-equestrian competition of the Paralympic Games in Paris in the “Grade I” group, becoming the Paralympic champion for the first time.\nWatch the full interview with Rihards, first published in 2020, below on the program “Life Has No Draft.”\nIt has already been announced that the Paralympic Games in Paris will be held until September 8, with Latvians competing in athletics, para dressage, cycling, swimming and shooting. 22 sports are represented at the Paralympic Games, in which around 4,400 athletes compete.\n#real #parents #gone.. #touching #life #story #paralympic #champion #Snikus\n– 2024-09-05 19:30:16",
