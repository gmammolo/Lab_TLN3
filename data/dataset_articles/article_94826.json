  "text": "Team Chalchuapa began its journey through the 2024 Clausura Tournament of the Tigo Sports Cup of the Major Basketball League (LMB) with a 64-49 victory over the Salvadoreños.\nLobos took the field with a winning attitude and, under the guidance of American Sean Scott, dominated the first quarter with a 13-point advantage (18-5), a decisive result for the progress of the match.\nThe locals further increased their lead over the Salvadoreños in the second episode, thanks to the shooting accuracy of Scott, who scored nine of the 14 points with which they closed that half, while the Salvadoreños added only nine points for a total of 32-14.\nAfter the break and with a disadvantage of 18 points, the Salvadoreños showed another team, with more confidence and concentration, managing to improve the performance of all their lines to pocket that quarter 14-15 and close the total at 46-29.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Salvadoreños boys committed themselves to conquer the Chalchuapa scoreboard, turning the game into a spectacle that kept the audience in suspense while both quintets proposed themselves on the attack, in the end the Capitals won the quarter with a two-point advantage 18-20, but overall the advantage went to Lobos 64-49.\nThe top scorers for the Lobos were Scott, who completed a double-double with 18 points and 10 rebounds, followed by Marc Montavious, who also recorded a double-double with 13 points and 17 rebounds, and Jerome Savoy with 11. For the Salvadoreños, team captain Lázaro González contributed 18 points and Erick Rodríguez, 11.\nThe LMB matches scheduled for today are Cojute-Metapán, at 7:15 p.m., at the Cojutepeque Municipal Gymnasium, and San Salvador-Ahuachapán, at the Ciudad Deportiva Inclusiva (CDI), at the same time.\n#Lobos #start #home #win #LMB #Diario #Página",
