  "text": "Gary Ah-Waye (3rd dr.) during Friday’s press conference at Soavina Atmosphère. With the unconditional support of the Malagasy Padel Federation, the Malagasy Pro Padel Tour (MPPT) is organizing the first edition of the Island Padel Cup from September 4 to 7, in Soavina Atmosphère. This was the good news announced on Friday by the organizers of the event, during a press conference.\nThis major event will bring together Madagascar as the host country, Mauritius and Reunion. “It will be an opportunity for players from the Big Island to compete against the best from the two neighboring islands. It is also an opportunity for the MPPT to reaffirm its commitment to promoting padel in Madagascar by offering a unique platform to promote the discipline that is booming in the Indian Ocean,” confides Gary Ah-Waye, co-manager of the MPPT.\nThis first edition of the Island Padel Cup has a dual interest: firstly, to strengthen sporting ties between island nations and, secondly, to develop the practice of padel at local and regional level.\nThe Malagasy Padel Federation is contributing its expertise and resources to ensure the success of this first edition. For the success of this great event, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Tourism and Orange Madagascar have joined forces to support Malagasy padel and the flag bearers of the Big Island.\nMadagascar will field its seven best players from the Orange MPPT circuit to shake up or even beat Mauritius and Reunion at home.\nTo begin the competition, Madagascar will start against Mauritius on September 4, then the Malagasy players will take on representatives from Reunion Island.\nDonné Raherinjatovo",
