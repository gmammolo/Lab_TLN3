  "text": "Brent Venables and his team are putting the finishing touches on preparation for their second game of the 2024 season. After a 48-point win over Temple , OU readies to host the Big 12’s Houston Cougars.\nThe Cougars are the first Big 12 team Oklahoma will face since moving to the SEC. The two teams have played twice in the last decade , with each side picking up a win.\nIn week one, Oklahoma struggled on 3rd down, going just 1/12 on the evening. The defense, however, suffocated the Owls. Offensive line play was a focus of much post-game hoopla, and rightfully so; the Sooners struggled to run the ball, and the depth at receiver was called into action. Most probably weren’t expected to contribute in 2024, but injuries have forced Emmett Jones’s hand.\nWillie Fritz left Tulane to take the job at Houston, and his team will be ready to play after a disappointing performance against UNLV.\nOklahoma should be able to win the game convincingly, but the Sooners can’t get caught napping, or things could get weird quickly.\nBelow, we compiled our three keys to a Sooners victory.\nEstablish the line of scrimmage This is a direct message to Bill Bedenbaugh and his offensive line. The big boys up front have been in a battle all offseason to decide who would earn snaps. And as the games go by, the Sooners need to be putting their five best out there so they can gel.\nProjected starter at right tackle Jake Taylor looks ready to suit up. Though we haven’t yet seen what Taylor’s capable of as a starting offensive lineman at the collegiate level, with a four-star pedigree, there are high hopes for the 2022 signee.\nThe Sooners need to come out and let the Cougars know that whatever ideas and inspiration they might have gleaned from the film against Temple will not work. The running game should pop much more often than it did in the first half of their week one win.\nUp Next: 2 More Keys to Victory",
