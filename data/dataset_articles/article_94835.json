  "text": "10. Achraf Hakimi (Marocco, Paris Saint-Germain) - In August: 2 goals, 2 assists. [Achraf Hakimi](https://www.transfermarkt.com/achraf-hakimi/profil/spieler/398073) was a key player for [Morocco](https://news.22bet.com/wiki/national-teams/morocco/) at the [Olympic Games](https://news.22bet.com/tag/olympic-games/) in August. His performances helped the African team reach the semi-finals of the tournament and ultimately secure a bronze medal. Even in the match they lost [against Spain](https://news.22bet.com/predictions/morocco-vs-spain-football-summer-olympic-games-05-08-2024/), Hakimi managed six tackles and four assists, which could have made a difference for Morocco in their quest for the final. The best way to come back home! +3🔫 [pic.twitter.com/IzAMIKba7H]— Achraf Hakimi (@AchrafHakimi) [August 23, 2024] Post-Olympics, Achraf performed brilliantly in three matches in the French league and was the best player against Montpellier. Hakimi is undoubtedly one of the best full-backs in world football right now. 9. Federico Valverde (Real Madrid) - In August: 2 goals,1 assist. [Federico Valverde](https://www.whoscored.com/Players/344644/Show/Federico-Valverde) has become a crucial player for [Real Madrid](https://news.22bet.com/wiki/club-teams/real-madrid/) in recent years. The Spanish midfielder is versatile and capable of delivering high-quality performances in almost any role on the pitch. Nominated for the 2024 Ballon d’Or Federico Valverde Real Madrid Uruguay[#ballondor][pic.twitter.com/5jrvYAan4c]— Ballon d’Or (@ballondor) [September 4, 2024] He significantly contributes to defensive efforts and effectively transitions from attack to defense. This has become especially important following the arrival of another attacking player, [Kylian Mbappé](https://news.22bet.com/wiki/players/kylian-mbappe/), a forward less inclined toward defensive duties. In addition, Valverde outplays opponents with his strong dribbling and regularly creates openings in the opponent’s penalty area, occasionally scoring goals. 8. Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen) - In August: 3 goals, 1 assist. [Wirtz](https://www.fotmob.com/en-GB/players/1152455/florian-wirtz) was the best player in the [Bundesliga](https://news.22bet.com/tag/bundesliga-2023-24/) last season, and it is crucial for [Leverkusen](https://news.22bet.com/wiki/club-teams/bayer-leverkusen/) that Florian stays at the club for as long as possible. After all, he continues to be the creative engine of the team, regularly orchestrating dangerous moments in the final third. Not The Result we wanted but I am still proud of my team [#B04RBL][pic.twitter.com/0JjhEuhI7O]— Florian wirtz (@FlorianWirtz10) [September 1, 2024] 7. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (Napoli) - In August: 1 goal, 1 assist. After Antonio Conte’s arrival as Napoli’s head coach, it became clear that [Khvicha Kvaratskhelia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khvicha_Kvaratskhelia) would have to adapt to the team’s new 3-4-3 formation. Conte prefers a system with three central defenders and two wing-backs, while Kvaratskhelia thrived as a left forward in a 4-3-3 / 4-2-3-1 formation. Despite the shift, the Georgian is adjusting well to the new system and effectively operates in the left half-space. In the new season, “Kvaradona “could emerge as one of [Serie A’s](https://news.22bet.com/tag/serie-a-24-25/) top performers this season. 6. Marcus Thuram (Inter Milan) - In August: 5 goals. [Marcus Thuram](https://www.sofascore.com/player/marcus-thuram/791702) has made an explosive start to the season, scoring 5 goals in August, inlcuding two braces – one of which came in a crucial victory against [Atalanta](https://news.22bet.com/predictions/inter-vs-atalanta-match-preview-prediction-betting-tips-30-08-2024/). After netting 13 goals in Serie A last season, Thuram is already proving instrumental in Inter Milan’s quest to defend their league title. Meilleur buteur de [#SerieA]avec 4 buts, Marcus[#Thuram]est nommé pour le titre de meilleur joueur du mois d’aoûtPar ici pour voter TIKUS [https://t.co/yqmulUu6Ga][pic.twitter.com/Mxp6Ox9mqb]— Canale Inter (@Canale_Inter) [September 5, 2024] His clinical finishing and dynamic play will be key to Inter’s ambitions in the [Champions League](https://news.22bet.com/tag/champions-league-24-25/) this season. 5. Mason Greenwood (Olympique de Marseille) - In August: 6 goals. [Mason Greenwood](https://www.transfermarkt.com/mason-greenwood/profil/spieler/532826) is fully showcasing his talent under Roberto De Zerbi’s guidance at [Olympique de Marseille](https://www.om.fr/en) and could well compete for the title of top scorer in [Ligue 1](https://news.22bet.com/tag/ligue-1-24-25/). De Zerbi on Mason Greenwood: “Mason is a very high level player, we all wanted him, the owner also got involved in person. There has been so much controversy, so much talk, but we all see the player on the pitch. I don’t want to get into his private life, I don’t know anything… [pic.twitter.com/lD4wqtfSoj]— Kara (@UTDKara) [September 1, 2024] Greenwood has scored in five consecutive matches and shows no signs of stopping, as he is in excellent physical condition. His transfer from Manchester United for €26 million this summer looks like a bargain, as he could have been a valuable asset for the [Premier League](https://news.22bet.com/tag/premier-league-24-25/) side. 4. Bukayo Saka (Arsenal) In August: 1 goal, 3 assists. [Bukayo Saka](https://www.whoscored.com/Players/367185/Show/Bukayo-Saka) has quickly achieved peak physical condition among the English players who represented the national team in [Euro 2024](https://news.22bet.com/tag/uefa-euro-2024/) and has already become [Arsenal’s](https://news.22bet.com/wiki/club-teams/arsenal/) standout player in August. Bukayo Saka remains the only Arsenal player in history to score or assist against every team he’s faced in the Premier League ⚽️🎯 [pic.twitter.com/yWHe4gBZwu]— ESPN UK (@ESPNUK) [September 5, 2024] Saka is valuable in fast combinations and maneuvers. Most importantly, he dangerously shoots at the goal from different positions. He also excellently performs varied crosses and cutbacks into the opponents’ penalty area. While he has scored only one goal, he is poised to become Arsenal’s top scorer again. 3. Erling Haaland (Manchester City) - In August: 10 goals Pep Guardiola continues integrating the Norwegian forward into his attacking model, leveraging Haaland’s remarkable ability to convert chances. No club has scored more Premier League goals than Erling Haaland this season 💀🤖 [pic.twitter.com/FxTdUEUINy]— OneFootball (@OneFootball) [September 3, 2024] Although [Haaland](https://www.sofascore.com/player/erling-haaland/839956) is minimally involved in combinations with his teammates, his efficiency in the penalty area is unparalleled. With 10 goals in August alone, Haaland is proving once again that he is one of the world’s most dangerous strikers. 2. Raphinha (Barcelona) - In August: 3 goals, 3 assist In recent years, European journalists have speculated about whether [Barcelona](https://news.22bet.com/wiki/club-teams/barcelona/) truly needs [Raphinha](https://www.whoscored.com/Players/300447/Show/Raphinha). Over the summer, there were even rumors that the Brazilian might leave the team, as he had few chances on the right flank, where he had to compete with the brilliant young talent Lamine Yamal. But Hansi Flick was able to maximize Raphinha’s best qualities by giving him more attacking freedom in the area between the lines. Raphinha Rises. [pic.twitter.com/TBdZr9H6X6]— FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) [September 4, 2024] Raphinha effectively beats defenders 1v1, makes penetrating passes into the penalty area, creates multi-pass combinations with teammates, and makes well-timed runs behind opponents into the penalty area. At the same time, he is very useful in pressing. If he continues to play like this, he could be in contention for the title of La Liga’s best player this season. 1. Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) In August: 4 goals, 4 assists. As has become tradition, [Mohamed Salah](https://www.sofascore.com/player/mohamed-salah/159665) is demonstrating top-class performance after the summer break, making a strong case for being considered the world’s best player. The rested Egyptian consistently makes a difference in the first part of the season but gradually slows down after January. They don’t really believe that Mohamed Salah is among the top 30 players in the world Hahaha wth this award has lost its credibility. [pic.twitter.com/AxD5iSYiIw]— ⁷𝐸¹¹ (@spumar7T) [September 4, 2024] Salah particularly feels the strain of the intense Premier League schedule from November to mid-January, exacerbated by his trip to the African Cup of Nations last year. However, just like in previous seasons, Salah is unstoppable in August and brings immense value to [Liverpool](https://news.22bet.com/wiki/club-teams/liverpool/), making a difference in every match. Salah is so magnificent in all attacking phases of play that it’s impossible not to place him at the top of the list of the best players in August 2024.",
