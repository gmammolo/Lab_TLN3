In addition, after a gap of many years, a national youth canoe polo championship was organized in Daugai.\nSummer – no holidays Alytus District In the School of Arts and Sports, canoeists have the opportunity to choose two disciplines: the Olympic sport of kayak sprint and the team game of canoe polo.\n“My students take part in sprint and canoe polo competitions both in Lithuania and abroad. Some prefer kayak sprints, others prefer canoeing. We have a total of 28 students and we have been working together for the third season. This summer was very active for us, practically without holidays: we trained a lot, participated in many competitions. It is this season that makes me very happy, we have great results”, says R. Sukackas.\nDaugiškii is the champion of the Polish Cup The most successful stage of the competition began in Poland in May. The Kanupolo Cup competition, which consisted of four stages, was held there. Alytus SRC and Alytus r. canoeists from the School of Art and Sports won all four stages, won the Polish Canoe Polo Cup and became the champions of this country, and coach R. Sukacks received the award for the best canoe polo coach.\nHe competed with the best in Europe Kayakers from the Alytus district competed with the best European teams in the German city of Essen for the German Cup. Although they returned home without a medal, it was a valuable experience to compete against the best in Europe.\nJust a hair’s breadth away from a medal Lithuanian kayak and canoe competitions for boys and young people were held in Trakai, where Alytus r. Students from art and sports schools also participated. For many of the younger rowers, this was their first competition. They had to compete with athletes who were 2-3 years older. In this age group, Titas Barysas and Martynas Gecevičius performed well, reaching the final in the K-2 1000m rowing. In the final, he lacked experience and strength against older opponents, but gained a lot of experience. Nojus Sukackas performed better in the junior competition, starting from the K-2-1000m event, taking an excellent 4th place and missing only 2 seconds to win the bronze medal.\n“The representatives of the federation were surprised that Daugai rowers are only in their third season and are already hot on their heels for medals,” coach R. Sukackas was pleased with the results of his students.\nFrom the Alytus International Tournament: Two winners’ cups and one 2nd place cup In Alytus, the international canoe-polo tournament “Baltosios rože” was held, which was successful in the Alytus district. for students of art and sports schools. Athletes from the Alytus district won two winners’ cups and 2nd place in three age groups. In the youngest age group U-12 and in the age group U-17, the teams won one “White Rose” cup each and became the winners of the tournament. In the age group U-14, the team took 2nd place.\nThe mayor’s cup is also at home On July 6, R. Sukack’s students competed for the cup of the mayor of Alytus Rasa Vitkauskienė district, and this prize did not go anywhere: it went to Daugiški.\nFour more medals in the sprint One of the last competitions of this season is the Student Kayak Sprint Championship held in Šiauliai. Eight athletes from the Alytus region took part, four of whom took home the runner-up and winner’s medals.\nThe last competition of this season is still expected in Šiauliai from 13 to 15 September, which gives the coach hope to enrich this year’s medal collection.\nThere is a lot of potential in Alytus district For the first time after a break of many years, in the last days of August, the Lithuanian Youth Canoe Championship was held in Daugai. Athletes from Daugai came in second.\n“Alytus district has great potential, many more similar championships can be organized in the city of Daugai, we just need to work with growing talents – both boys and girls, strengthen the kayak sports base in Daugai and attract at least two more coaches to this industry,” said coach R. Sukacks, who this year is nurturing the project of gathering an even larger team of representatives of this sport.\nSpeaking about talents, coach R. Sukacks was pleased with the leader of the canoe-polo team, Vakaris Sukacks, who was recognized as the best player of the entire season and received an award. According to the coach, he was well supported by Aivaras Jonauskas and Martynas Gecevičius.\nVakaris Sukackis, Nojas Sukackis and the young athletes Augusta Sukarevičiūta and Rasa Ribačiauskaitei, who became the winners of the Lithuanian canoe polo championship for schoolchildren, performed well in the sprint.\nInformation from the Communication Department of the Alytus District Municipality Administration\n#kayakers #championship #titles #award #medals #season #account\n– 2024-09-05 19:58:07",
