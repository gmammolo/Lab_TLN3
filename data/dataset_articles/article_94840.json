  "text": "SV Guntamatic Ried has strengthened its offensive once again. In Austria , the transfer window closes today at 5 p.m. Antonio Van Wyk, a 22-year-old offensive player from Stellenbosch FC (South Africa), has signed in Ried, the OÖN reported. Wolfgang Fiala, SV Ried ‘s sports director, confirmed this on Thursday afternoon when asked by the OÖNachrichten. The player will receive a two-year contract. “The ÖFB still has to confirm the transfer. The transfer will be 100 percent fixed when Van Wyk passes the medical check and the Red-White-Red Card after his arrival in Ried,” says Fiala. Van Wyk already had an appointment at the Austrian embassy in Pretoria, South Africa’s capital. Now it all depends on how fast the authorities are. In Ried, they hope that Van Wyk will soon come to Austria and start training. Van Wyk comes as a replacement for Belmin Beganovic, who moved to Sturm Graz for a reported 500,000 euros. Despite the current market value of one million euros, Ried did not have to pay a high transfer fee for Van Wyk.\nThere is bad news for Dominik Stöger, the 17-year-old goalkeeper of the Young Vikings. Stöger has sustained a knee injury and will be out for several months. For this reason, says Fiala, they will bring in a goalkeeper from another club on a cooperative basis before Christmas. There will be no more departures today.\nStriker talent in sight Table of Contents\n0.0.1 Striker talent in sight 0.0.2 Read ePaper now! 1 SV Guntamatic Ried: Strengthening Offense with⁢ New Signings 1.0.1 New Signing: Antonio Van Wyk Joins SV Ried 1.0.2 Injury Concerns: Dominik Stöger⁣ Faces Long Recovery 1.0.3 Striker Talent in Sight: Simon Nussbaumer Impresses 1.0.4 Conclusion: A Bright Future Ahead for SV Guntamatic Ried Simon Nussbaumer made a good impression.
