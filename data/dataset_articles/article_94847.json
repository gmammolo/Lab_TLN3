  "text": "In case anyone thought Kosmo had lost a step in the offseason, opening week proved that his reads are still pretty darn good.\nA record of 5-2 could have been 6-1 if not for a 22-21 victory overtime win by Rochester Adams over Romeo that made Kosmo look silly for picking against the OAA side.\nProps go to Clarkston, too, as Kosmo got that pick right, but the Wolves showed that they could hang with what’s perceived to be the best team — and QB — in the state in Belleville. Justin Pintar’s team didn’t get a first-place vote in the OAA Red Preseason Coaches Poll, but more Friday’s like the last could give them a say alongside the two teams that did, West Bloomfield and Lake Orion.\nKosmo The second weekend includes a few city rivalry battles that have Kosmo chomping at the bit, including the Highlanders in action to either prove Kosmo right or wrong yet again, as well as some juicy OAA crossovers featuring divisional contenders.\nHere are the picks with Week 2 upon us:\nRochester Adams at Rochester — Kosmo remembers 2018 as the last time Rochester put up a real good fight against Adams, as the Falcons took their rivals to double-overtime before losing 28-27 in that year’s opener. The Falcons, like Adams, were victors in their OAA-MAC crossover on opening weekend, beating Fraser 38-7. Long story short, if Adams fools twice, shame on Kosmo. Kosmo says: Rochester Adams\nWalled Lake Northern at Walled Lake Central — The Knights had a tough start to the season on home turf, getting blanked 35-0 by South Lyon. It looks like they’ll be tested by another tough defense when they make the short trip to Oakley Park Rd. and take on the Vikings, who beat Berkley 7-0 in OT to start the season. Northern trounced in last year’s meeting, 38-3, and while it may not be as high-octane this year, it may be the same result. Kosmo says: WL Northern\nJackson Lumen Christi at Pontiac Notre Dame Prep — Two-time defending Division 7 champs and perennial power Jackson Lumen Christi visits the Fighting Irish for a matchup Kosmo circled so many times he had to have more pens supply dropped to the cave. The Titans are on the hunt for a three-peat as they move up to Division 6, while NDP got started by flying high with a 49-14 victory over Detroit Central to begin the quest for a Division 5 playoff appearance. Both teams should punch a postseason ticket, but there can only be one winner Friday night. Kosmo says: Jackson Lumen Christi\nToledo Catholic Central (OH) at Detroit Catholic Central — Last week featured plenty of county crossovers, but how about a battle between the Shamrocks against a CHSL opponent from the state which shall not be named by Michigan fans? The Irish opened with a victory over crosstown rival Whitmer, while the Shamrocks packed an offensive punch with a 56-12 road win at Dearborn. It’s a tall task, but Kosmo would rather be sinking with the ship than choose a team from that place down south. Kosmo says: Detroit Catholic Central\nAuburn Hills Avondale at Birmingham Seaholm — It’s a battle between two teams picked to win their respective OAA divisions. The Maples proved that they still have something left in the cupboard despite graduating some hard-hitters with their 42-0 thumping of Troy Athens in Week 1. Avondale, meanwhile, came up short in a 20-14 defeat against Cedar Springs, and the Yellow Jackets might have to wait until the third week to put one up in the win column with the OAA Blue favs on deck. Kosmo says: Seaholm\nClarkston at Southfield A&T — The Keith McKenzie era got off to a roaring start with A&T’s 46-0 romp of Flint Beecher, and Kosmo couldn’t be happier for the defending champs. But Kosmo saw the opening game tape of the Wolves, who were capable of big plays through the air and also of generating turnovers. They may turn Southfield into their den this Friday. Kosmo says: Clarkston\nWest Bloomfield at Birmingham Groves — Here are two teams that probably couldn’t be more smitten with their results to start the fall. Kosmo noticed that the Lakers wrote the book for defending the OAA’s reputation with last week’s 42-0 dispatching of Chippewa Valley. Now it’s time for a trip to take on the team picked to win the OAA White, Groves, who beat Detroit U-D Jesuit 35-14 on the road in Week 1. Kosmo knows the Falcons are trying to party like it’s 2019, the last time they beat the Lakers, but Kosmo thinks any celebrations that involve beating the Lakers this season will be few and far between.
