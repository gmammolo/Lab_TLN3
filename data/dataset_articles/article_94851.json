His debut season was marked by an impressive achievement as he was awarded the club’s Red-Ball Batter of the Year after scoring 969 runs with an average of 38.66.\nDirector of Cricket’s Praise Giles White, the director of cricket at Hampshire, commended Brown’s skills, stating, “Ben is a fantastic player. He has high standards and a will to win that keeps driving the team forward. His ability behind the stumps, coupled with his batting, makes him an extremely valuable player.”\nRecord-Breaking Partnerships and Milestones In his tenure, Brown notably partnered with Liam Dawson to set a new record for the fifth-wicket stand, achieving 273 runs together just weeks after his arrival at the club in April 2022. He also reached personal milestones, including a career-high score of 165 not out against Surrey in the County Championship and 139 not out against Northamptonshire in the One-Day Cup.\nPlayer’s Reflection on Continued Tenure Expressing his enthusiasm for the renewed contract, Brown remarked, “I feel very happy to have signed another contract at Hampshire. I have loved my time playing here and I’m excited to see what this squad can achieve next season. Each year is special when you reach this stage of a career and I’m looking forward to contributing to the club pushing for trophies next season.”",
