He later scored after contributions from Fernando Tatis⁢ Jr. and Manny Machado , leveling the score at five.\nFollowing⁤ that at-bat, Arraez​ faced a new pitcher, Beau Brieske , and‌ successfully delivered his second ⁢hit, sending‌ it through the center at 99 MPH. In a‌ moment of aggressive base running, he‍ advanced‌ to second base, bringing his total ⁢stolen bases to⁤ nine.\nIn his last two at-bats, Luis ⁢Arraez hit⁣ a⁢ ground⁢ ball in the seventh inning and‍ was granted‍ an ‍automatic walk in the bottom of ⁢the tenth ‌inning.\nWith his two hits in this game, the talented player ‍has now achieved‍ a total of 173⁢ hits (leading the‍ National ‍League) and 214 total bases.\n“`\nhtml\nh, Arraez showcased his exceptional batting skills, recording two crucial hits that helped propel his team to win.
