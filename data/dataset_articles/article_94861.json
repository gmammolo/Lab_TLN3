  "text": "César Farías (left) is the new coach of Junior in Colombia / Photo: La Página Rojiblanca\nVenezuelan César Farías has become the new coach of Junior de Barranquilla, international media outlets including El Heraldo, D-Sports, Vavel and ESPN reported on Wednesday.\nFarías, former coach of Venezuela and Bolivia, took over the reins of the professional football club of the BetPlay Dimayor League after the management of that team fired Arturo Reyes for not being satisfied with his tactical system or his work philosophy.\nReyes was fired after the Albirrojo team tied 1-1 at home on Sunday with Independiente Santa Fe on the eighth date of the 2024 Clausura Tournament, where the first team is sixth among 20 teams with 12 points collected. Santa Fe is fifth with 13 cards.\nSealed agreement Farías, who previously managed Águilas Doradas and América de Cali in the Colombian Primera División, will be linked to Junior until December 31, 2025.\nThe information about the contract was provided by Fuad Char, the majority shareholder of El Tiburón, who stated that the new helmsman’s mission will be to win titles in different events to fulfill the wishes of the fans.\n“We’re looking for the championship and to have every chance of being in the Copa Libertadores again,” Char explained to Futbolete.com. “We depend on the public, who guide us and who set the path, who buy the tickets, the season tickets, and we have to meet their demands.”\n“You have to look for a coach with a track record to get good results and Farías is one of them. We hope he has a great cycle in this institution,” added Char, who hopes that the native can emulate what he did with The Strongest (Apertura 2016) and Aucas (Serie A 2022), teams with which he was consecrated in the paid competitions of Bolivia and Ecuador, respectively.\nValencia / Joseph Ñambre\n#César #Farías #coach #Junior #Colombian #league\n2024-09-05 16:51:11",
