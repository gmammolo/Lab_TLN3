He will now also lead the white-ball teams starting in January.\nStokes, 33, who serves as the Test captain, had previously come out of retirement to participate in the one-day international setup during last year’s World Cup, although he has not been part of England’s white-ball squad since then.\nMcCullum’s Trust in Stokes Regarding their working relationship, McCullum stated, “He’s been incredible and our relationship is fantastic. You never know where the game’s going globally and what sort of opportunities will pop up for him, but I know how invested he is in English cricket and how determined he is to drive this team forward.”\nFuture Expectations Before McCullum’s recent extension of his contract, there were speculations about both he and Stokes potentially stepping down after the upcoming Ashes series in Australia planned for the winter of 2025-26. However, under the new agreement, McCullum will retain leadership until the home Ashes in the summer of 2027 along with the 50-over World Cup scheduled for later that year.\nHis tenure will see him involved in the Champions Trophy early in the coming year and a T20 World Cup in 2026.\nStokes’ Aspirations In a recent interview with the Telegraph, Stokes expressed that “in an ideal world” he would still hold the position of Test captain in 2027, indicating that he finds it challenging to decline participation in global tournaments.\nMcCullum’s Confidence in Team Performance In anticipation of the upcoming Test match against Sri Lanka at the Kia Oval, McCullum remarked, “The skipper and I haven’t spoken, but I’m assuming he’s all in. He seems like that sort of bloke.” He further expressed confidence in Stokes’ ability to thrive in high-pressure situations.\nSupport for Buttler McCullum also affirmed his support for Jos Buttler as England’s white-ball captain, despite a tough year that culminated in the departure of coach Matthew Mott. Despite England’s recent struggles, having lost significantly in the 50-over World Cup and semi-finals of the T20 World Cup, McCullum remains optimistic about Buttler’s contributions.\nHe described Buttler’s demeanor as occasionally “a little bit miserable at times,” urging him to enjoy the forthcoming years and seize the opportunity to lead a talented group of players.\nLooking Ahead With the packed schedule for England’s cricket team, McCullum indicated that he would miss some series, delegating responsibilities to assistant coaches while balancing time with his family in New Zealand.\nHaving achieved victories in all five Tests this summer, England is aiming for a clean sweep against Sri Lanka this week—a feat they haven’t accomplished since 2004.\nDebut for Hull The team is set to introduce Leicestershire’s left-arm bowler Josh Hull, selecting him based on potential despite a challenging domestic record. McCullum noted, “What we are trying to achieve is bringing in some of these guys who we see as rough diamonds with incredibly high ceilings.”\nDespite uncertainty regarding the schedule for their upcoming Tests in Pakistan, McCullum expressed hope for clarity soon so that team selections can proceed smoothly.",
