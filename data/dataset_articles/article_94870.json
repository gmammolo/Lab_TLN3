  "text": "Table of Contents\nToggle\nIntroduction of Women’s Teams in Major Competitions Teams and Structure Investment and Development Plans for Future Seasons Comments from Cricket Officials Introduction of Women’s Teams in Major Competitions\nEight new women’s professional cricket teams are set to participate in the T20 Blast and One-Day Cup starting next season, marking a significant step towards aligning women’s sports more closely with their male counterparts.\nTeams and Structure The teams included in this initiative are Durham, Essex, Hampshire, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Somerset, Surrey, and Warwickshire. These teams were granted Tier 1 status by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) earlier this year as part of a comprehensive restructure of women’s domestic cricket planned for 2025. Each team will compete under their respective county identities, with the exception of the Trent Bridge team, which will retain the name The Blaze.\nFor the T20 Blast, Warwickshire will adopt the name Birmingham Bears, mirroring their men’s team branding, while Lancashire will be referred to as Lancashire Thunder.\nInvestment and Development The ECB has announced that this new professional framework will inject £8 million annually into women’s domestic cricket until 2027, raising total funding in this sector to £19 million per year. This financial boost aims to potentially increase the number of professional female cricketers in England and Wales by 80% by 2029.\nAdditionally, the structure will feature a knockout cup competition that incorporates teams from all three tiers of the newly expanded women’s domestic framework. This competition is designed to allow all counties to face off against each other, compete at prestigious venues, and provide players with valuable exposure.\nPlans for Future Seasons The upcoming season is anticipated to include several double-header events, where both women’s and men’s teams will play on the same day. This restructuring signifies a departure from the regional format that has prevailed in recent years, effectively phasing out the Charlotte Edwards Cup and the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy after the current summer.\nComments from Cricket Officials Beth Barrett-Wild, the director of the women’s professional game, stated, “A big driver for the reorganisation has been to enable us to better use the leverage and existing scale of men’s county cricket to accelerate fanbase growth for our women’s teams and players.” She further added, “As we have seen through The Hundred and alignment of our England Men’s and England Women’s teams, we believe that by putting our men’s and women’s competitions and players on the same platform we can exponentially increase the reach of the women’s domestic game and intensify the depth of feeling fans have for our women’s teams moving forwards.”",
