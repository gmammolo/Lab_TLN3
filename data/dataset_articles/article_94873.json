  "text": "The Wolves-Chelsea match saw a terrifying explosion of the Blues attack. They won with the result of a tennis to forget the defeat against Manchester City on the opening day.\nWolves: Cunha (27′), Larsen (45’+6)\nChelsea: English: Jackson (2′), Palmer (45′), Madueke (49′, 59′, 63′), Felix (81′)\nMarching to the Wolves pitch, Chelsea were determined to win the first 3 points after losing to Manchester City in the opening round. Coach Enzo Maresca decided to bench debutants like Pedro Neto or Joao Felix. The hope in attack is still Cole Palmer, Nicolas Jackson and Noni Madueke.\nIn the first minute Palmer passed the ball on the right flank to Madueke in an open position. He shot from a tight angle but failed. In the next corner, the ball reached Jackson and he easily directed the ball into the home side’s net to open the score.\nBeing behind, Wolves rushed forward to attack wildly. In the 16th minute, Matheus Cunha put the ball in the Chelsea net, but the referee whistled an offside penalty against Larsen, who passed the ball to him.\nHowever, Cunha still managed to get his name on the scoreboard in the 27th minute. Starting with Caicedo losing the ball, Wolves had a quick counterattack. The ball fell to Cunha in an open position and the player accurately finished the ball past Robert Sanchez.\nThe fact that the two goals came so quickly made the game very open. The two teams played at full speed and Chelsea took the lead again in the 45th minute. From a long pass from goalkeeper Sanchez, Jackson delicately touched the ball. The ball reached Palmer and the player sensibly lifted the ball over the head of goalkeeper Jose Sa to increase the score to 2-1 for Chelsea.\nHowever, in the 6th minute of first half injury time, Wolves scored the equaliser. The home team received a free kick, the ball was sent to Toti Gomes on the right flank. The midfielder then directed the ball to Larsen to cushion the ball into the Chelsea net. 2-2 is also the first half score.\nEntering the second half, Chelsea exploded with force. The duo of Cole Palmer and Noni Madueke combined to score 3 goals in just 14 minutes. Palmer completed a hat-trick of assists and Madueke scored a hat-trick of goals in the 49th, 59th and 63rd minutes.\nNot only that, Chelsea also scored their sixth goal in the 81st minute through debutant Joao Felix. Notably, the person who passed him the ball was also another debutant. That is winger Pedro Neto. The match ended with the score 6-2 in favor of Chelsea. The London team achieved a brilliant victory to forget the 0-2 defeat against Manchester City on the opening day.\nThe program of the match Wolves-Chelsea Wolves: Sa, Doherty, Mosquera, Toti Gomes, Ait-Nouri (Dawson 68′), Lemina (Doyle 90’+1), Joao Gomes, Bellegarde (Rodrigo Gomes 68′), Hwang Hee-chan (Podence 61′), Cunha ( Sarabia 68′), Larsen.\nChelsea: Sanchez, Gusto, Fofana, Colwill, Cucurella (Veiga 83′), Caicedo (Dewsbury-Hall 76′), Enzo, Madueke, Palmer (Nkunku 83′), Mudryk (Pedro Neto 46′), Jackson (Felix 68′).",
