  "text": "Impressive teenager Jutorre Burgess came off the bench to help Harborough Town move a step closer to qualifying for the prestigious FA Cup. The 18-year-old Bermudian winger made an impact in an impressive 3-2 comeback win away at Darlaston Town in the first round of FA Cup qualifying at Paycare Ground on Wednesday. “It was a pleasure playing in the oldest competition in the world,” an elated Burgess told The Royal Gazette. “I just want to thank God first and foremost and also thank Harborough Town for trusting me to come on when we were 2-0 down to make an impact and then eventually winning 3-2 in the replay. “Everything has happened really fast, so I just have to keep my head down and continue working.” Burgess, who started in Harborough’s goalless draw at home to Darlaston in the initial cup tie at Bowdens Park last weekend, has made early strides at the Southern League Premier Division Central club. “The club, players and the fans have been very welcoming,” Burgess added, having become the first player from the club’s under-23 squad to sign with the senior team. “During my first appearance with the first team in preseason they made me instantly feel welcome and even coming on late in the game to make my debut. Just hearing the fans clapping your first couple of steps on the pitch and even asking for pictures shows that this really is a family club that support the team.” The transition from academy to senior level has been a seamless one for the former Hamilton Parish youth player. “Transitioning from Brooke House College Football Academy straight into men’s football would be hard for anybody, but my development at the school has given me the platform I need to make such a huge step up,” Burgess explained. “But the transition isn’t just on the pitch, it’s also before and after the game in the changing rooms and even how you recover and prepare because the games are very close together and if you don’t recover right it will take a toll on your body.” Burgess offered a glimpse of his potential in only his second appearance for the senior squad when he came off the bench to help salvage a point in a league derby at Kettering Town on August 26. “It’s really hard to put into words coming on in a derby as a teenager with 1,500 home fans giving you stick and then turning around and winning the penalty in the dying minutes of the game to earn a valuable point which sent the fans nuts,” he said. “I even got some beer on me from me jumping in the crowd. But that’s how you know that the fans are behind us wherever we go and we just have to repay them by winning games.” Josh Unsworth, the Harborough under-23 coach, has high expectations for the promising player. “I’m super impressed with Jutorre,” he said. “To come to a new environment surrounded by new players, new coaches, it’s not easy for a young lad to come into that. He took it in his stride. “It’s important for me to get to know my players on a personal level, too. To build that trust, that relationship, so when we go onto the pitch we’re ready for war together. Jutorre has adapted that mentality quickly.” “My only expectation is on Jutorre is to be the best version of himself. That’s all. “If he does that, boy, the sky is the limit. He is so talented, so dedicated, so committed. If he carries on how he’s doing, the boy will go far.” Need to Know How do I clear my cache and cookies? 2.
