  "text": "For the Franklin football team, the painful conclusion is forever lasting.\nThe huge smile Leslie Noble IV always sported is gone. The positive words that were an everyday constant, often delivered in his comical, exaggerated tone, are no more.\nIt’s been three weeks since Noble, a 16-year-old junior guard, collapsed and died during the team’s first day of practice on Aug. 14, leaving the Reisterstown school and its football program saddened and stunned.\nPractice has continued. The first day of school arrived. And now the Indians are set to begin their season Friday at 7 p.m. against visiting Westminster.\nNoble never leaves the team’s thoughts, a testament to the powerful impact he was able to make .\n“You genuinely understood how much he cared and how much love he had inside him,” Franklin football coach Anthony Burgos said. “You never knew what he was going to say because it was going to be honest. I always said to him, ‘You changed coaching for me. In my 22 years of coaching, you’re the most unique and dynamic player I’ve ever coached.’”\nWhen he entered Franklin as a freshman, Noble quickly warmed to the “big ol’ teddy bear” tag. The coaching staff tested him over and over and had early questions about whether he would stick. He grinded, steadily improved, and put himself in position for a breakthrough junior season. He made sure to bring his teammates along for the ride.\n“A lot of times we come out here to practice and, honestly, sometimes we would become a little lackadaisical and just his personality was always uplifting. In his own way, he kind of made us want to pick it up a notch,” senior wide receiver-defensive back Tristen Richardson said. “It’s sad … but just knowing how he impacted us and seeing how we’re carrying on his personality and the different things he instilled on us, it’s nice to see.”\n“We’re going to remember the importance of life, the importance of being a great character person, and the importance of being the best you can possibly be,” Franklin football coach Anthony Burgos said. (Karl Merton Ferron/Staff) X’s and O’s were tossed aside on the first day of practice after Noble’s death. In the sudden and unchartered territory, Burgos found a far more important message to provide support to his hurting group.\n“The message was we’re going to forget about football for now. It’s not the most important thing,” he said. “We’re going to remember the importance of life, the importance of being a great character person, and the importance of being the best you can possibly be.\n“I didn’t want to talk about football and it’s not about us going to play for Leslie this season. It’s about how precious life is and that you want to have an impact in this life. A lot of people think you’ve got to live a long time to have an impact. Leslie lived 16 years and he had such a tremendous impact on people.”\nThe Leslie Noble stories from the Franklin football family are bountiful and unique.\nSenior tackle Caleb Hunley, who worked alongside him on the offensive line, appreciated how Noble’s presence could instantly turn a rough day into a better one.\n“A memory that comes back to me is the first time I ever talked to him, he called me his cousin. ‘What’s up, cousin?’ And, always after that, he always called me cousin,” he said. “He was such a bright light. Around the school, everybody knew him. He was such a joy of life.”\nFor longtime assistant coach Tim Miller, the walks back inside the school from practices were always his special time with Noble.\nThe rapid-fire banter was priceless.\n“Just Leslie being Leslie,” Miller said. “He’d say, ‘I’m tired, Coach. I’m tired.’ And I’d always say, ‘What are you talking about, Leslie, you didn’t do anything.’ He’d come back, ‘Coach, you didn’t see me out there working? I was working!’ I’m laughing and like, ‘C’mon Leslie, you didn’t do nothing,’ and he’d come back quick, ‘Yes, I did Coach, look at this — I’m sweating!’\n“It was just his voice, his smile and his infectious words that are always on my mind. That day took a lot from me, but I find light in these kids and that’s why I’m here. I pray that Leslie’s family gets through these days.”\nRelated Articles High School Sports | No. 1 Loyola Blakefield soccer looks the part in 7-0 win over No. 5 Spalding High School Sports | Capital Gazette 2024 high school girls soccer: A young county scene can be anybody’s to win High School Sports | Baltimore Sun high school field hockey preview: Storylines, players to watch and top 15 teams heading into 2024 season High School Sports | Capital Gazette 2024 high boys soccer preview: As club participation rises, parity may as well High School Sports | High school girls flag football set to debut in Baltimore City this fall season The loss of Noble was the second tragedy the team endured this summer. On July 6, former teammate JaJa Williams, who graduated in the spring, died in a UTV accident family gathering in West Virginia . The team will honor both players before Friday’s game.\n“I’m a man of faith and I use all this as motivation when I go out and play,” Richardson said. “I use them as a why. Why I play this game. Why I give it my all every time I step on the field. I use them to fuel my drive. And I pray. I pray about it before I step on the field.”\nBurgos said the tragedies have redefined his role as a coach, giving him a new perspective and way to communicate with the young men he mentors.\n“It’s not as much about football, but it’s about life and getting these kids to understand how to embrace life every day, how to get the most out of each day and really learning how to overcome adversity and overcome storms,” he said.",
