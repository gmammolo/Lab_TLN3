  "text": "Last season, [Los Angeles Rams](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/los-angeles-rams) wide receiver Puka Nacua came in and took the [NFL](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl) world by storm. The young receiver was able to have one of the top receiving seasons in the league last year, and arguably the best season we’ve ever seen from a rookie wide receiver. Nacua was a machine for the Rams offense in the absence of Cooper Kupp for large portions of the season, setting rookie records for receptions and yards, and scoring six touchdowns. It’s the kind of rookie season that won’t be replicated for a long time… Or is it? Could Nacua’s rookie records for receptions and yards fall just one season after they were set? That’s what one NFL analyst is predicting for this season. Tyler Sullivan, NFL analyst for CBS Sports, released his [five bold predictions](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/2024-nfl-season-bold-predictions-aaron-rodgers-vs-packers-super-bowl-marvin-harrison-jr-bests-puka-nacua/) ahead of Thursday’s regular season kickoff, and he has [Arizona Cardinals](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/arizona-cardinals) rookie Marvin Harrison, Jr. setting the new top marks for a rookie wide receiver. Harrison should have the opportunity, as even as a rookie, he comes in as the clear top option for the Cardinals passing attack. He’ll also benefit from a healthy Kyler Murray getting him the ball. Murray hasn’t had a receiving option of Harrison’s caliber since 2020 when the Cardinals paired him with former [Houston Texans](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/houston-texans) wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins. That season, Murray found Hopkins 115 times for 1,407 yards. That pace would put Harrison well ahead of Nacua’s reception record of 105, and just 79 yards shy of tying the yardage mark. The Cardinals are going to need to pass the ball early and often if they want to keep pace in the NFC West with the likes of the [San Francisco 49ers](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/san-francisco-49ers) and their trio of wide receivers in [Deebo Samuel](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/news/49ers-restructure-receivers-deal-create-cap-space-says-insider/3907149b4cd59a4b1c32564c), [Brandon Aiyuk](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/news/49ers-all-pro-signs-massive-contract-extension-ends-holdout-nfl-insider/2b14680cf68186582b384e61), and Jauan Jennings. Those expectations may be lofty for a rookie, but if anyone is going to approach Nacua’s record, choosing the fourth-overall pick and the son of a Hall of Fame wide receiver is a pretty good choice. Harrison and the Cardinals offense get their first crack at setting the pace for the season on Sunday against Josh Allen and the [Buffalo Bills](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/buffalo-bills).",
