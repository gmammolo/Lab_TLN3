  "text": "[Denver’s Washington Park](https://www.denver.org/listing/washington-park/6828/) will be the linchpin of the Colorado School of Mines cross country teams’ 2024 season. The Orediggers kick off [their fall running schedule](https://minesathletics.com/sports/cross-country/schedule) Sept. 21 at the annual Roadrunners Invitational. Coach Chris Siemers and two senior runners expected it to be a good way to “get the rust off” after a long summer, and they hoped Mines fans would pack the sidelines. “That first race is always special,” graduate student Logan Bocovich said. “Just to see individually where you’re at and see how the team’s been putting in the work.” However, Siemers said the Orediggers’ second meet there [in November](https://minesathletics.com/sports/cross-country/schedule) will be much more important. The NCAA Division II South Central Regional Championships will be [at Washington Park Nov. 9](https://minesathletics.com/sports/cross-country/schedule). Siemers said it gives his runners a noticeable advantage, as they won’t have to travel two weeks before the national meet. “Any time you travel, especially to another time zone, you’re compromising your sleep,” Siemers continued. “That’s the most important thing for a college student-athlete, especially at Mines.” He hoped the Oredigger faithful would make the 16-mile trek to Washington Park and cheer on the Mines teams [Nov. 9](https://minesathletics.com/sports/cross-country/schedule) as they try to qualify for nationals. The NCAA Division II National Championship meet will be [Nov. 23](https://minesathletics.com/sports/cross-country/schedule) in Sacramento, and Siemers said the Orediggers did well the last time the teams competed there. He described the course as “honest,” and was confident the Mines men’s and women’s teams would build on [last year’s second- and third-place national finishes](https://coloradocommunitymedia.com/2023/11/20/runners-up-mines-xc-places-2nd-3rd-at-ncaa-championships/), respectively. “I think both teams set their bar high in terms of mileage and quality over the summer,” Siemers said. “They were hungry, and they made sure to get the work in. That’s going to allow us to reach our full potential this season.” While both teams lost four of their top seven runners from last year, Siemers believed the Mines men’s team has the best one-two-three punch in the country in [returning runners](https://minesathletics.com/sports/cross-country/roster) Bocovich, Logan Scomparin and Paul Knight. On the women’s side, he said redshirt senior Jenna Ramsey-Rutledge will contend for an individual national title, and three or four others will likely earn All-American honors. Even though both sets of Orediggers lost very strong runners and leaders, Siemers and redshirt junior Grace Strongman said the underclassmen are eager to learn and hungry to build on Mines’ legacy. Strongman said she’s been helping mentor [the younger runners](https://minesathletics.com/sports/cross-country/roster), and in doing so, she’s learned just as much as they have, adding, “It makes me a better runner to have people around me who are trying to be better runners too.” Siemers was confident in Strongman and other Orediggers who are taking more responsibilities and leadership duties within the teams, saying they’re eager “to represent the school and show that we’re going to be contenders once again.” He added: “(They) know it’s their turn to step up … and help the program stay strong.” Making the uphill battles easier Because this is his last year of eligibility, Bocovich said he plans to leave everything out on the course. The graduate transfer joined Mines last season and placed 16th at nationals. While it was a “fantastic result,” he hopes to do even better this season. He wasn’t on the Mines men’s team when it won the 2022 national championship, but wanted to help replicate that success this fall. “I’ve been going all-out (training) this summer,” he said. “ … The competition is as good as it’s ever been. So, we’re focusing on what we can do to better ourselves every day.” To that end, the Mines teams have been making good use of [their new training course](https://coloradocommunitymedia.com/2023/06/12/mines-athletics-receives-65-million-donation-for-scholarships-facilities/) south of the Mines Park area, [adjacent to U.S. Highway 6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B7fmb8Dn7pZoKzh87). The course has a 1K loop and a 2K loop, and Strongman said one is perfect “for some faster reps” while the other “has a monster hill.” Although most of this year’s race courses are flat, Strongman said the training course’s hill is the perfect practice for Chicago’s Lewis Crossover Invitational, which “opens on a pretty big hill.” Overall, she and Siemers said, the new training course has made the Orediggers stronger. “I know we’re all set up to have some break-out seasons,” Strongman said of her teammates. Both Strongman and Bocovich are graduating this spring with their respective degrees, although Strongman said she’ll return next year for her final season and work on a master’s degree. Bocovich, meanwhile, said he plans to continue running after graduation. The exercise helps with work-life balance, he described, adding that he’d like to run competitively for a few more years. If he finds a job in the Denver area, as he hopes, he was confident he’d find teammates — both old and new — to run with regularly. “I’m excited for that journey,” Bocovich said.",
