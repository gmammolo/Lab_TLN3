  "text": "Gideon “ESPN” Lampron has always wanted to put on a show on the gridiron.\nLampron did it at Keystone. Two years later, he found his fit at Dayton, where he stars at linebacker.\n“This is something that I have been wanting for so long,” he said. “I’ve always wanted the responsibility of starting, especially at the college level. This is something that I have been dreaming of since I was in eighth grade. It’s been surreal, but I have been expecting it.”\nDayton defeated St. Francis, 18-10, in its season opener. He was such a force in his first start, Lampron was awarded the FCS National Defensive Player of the Week.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Dayton Flyers Football (@daytonflyersfb)\nHe had six solo tackles (11 total), a pair of forced fumbles, a fumble recovery, one sack and three tackles for loss.\n“I feel like he’s been handling the expectations well,” Dayton Coach Trevor Andrews said. “He was the national defensive player of the week, so I’d say I feel exceptional about it right now. No pressure, but all he has got to do is repeat the same performance every week and I’ll be very happy with him.”\nWhen looking at Lampron’s social media pages, the name ESPN could appear as a nickname for the former Wildcat. However, it is actually his middle name, given by his father Marty, an avid sports fan.\n“I want to make my dad proud, because him making my middle name ‘ESPN,’ it has set some expectations. I am just trying to deliver,” he said. “(Marty Lampron) loves watching me play sports more than anything in his life.”\nGideon’s original middle name was set to be Xavior. Marty Lampron vetoed it and had it set to ESPN, all caps and pronounced by the letters for the Entertainment Sports Programming Network.\n“I wouldn’t have it any other way,” Lampron said. “Some of my friends would laugh. I never really hid it, I just never talked about it ever. Now, this is something that my friends are finding out. I have it on my Instagram and (X). I love (my middle name).”\nLampron was the Keystone leader at linebacker and running back. So much so, he was named as one of nine finalists for Ohio Mr. Football in 2021.\nThat is one of many accolades he acquired in LaGrange, as he was also awarded the Matt Wilhelm Award his junior year and Lorain County Golden Helmet award in his senior season.\nKeystone running back Gideon Lampron takes advantage of the opening the offense created for him and moves the ball upfield. (Jennifer Forbus – for The Morning Journal) He had a fresh start at Dayton, as his teammates were just as talented. He stuck to it and kept working his way through his first two seasons, and he contributed on special teams.\nDuring his time, Dayton went through a coaching change to Andrews, a UD alum, in 2023, which was after Lampron’s freshman year.\n“Right after I got the job here in January of 2023 is when I first found out. I thought the guys were messing with me,” Andrews said. “But Jake Speller, our operations director was with the previous staff, told me (ESPN) really was his middle name. I thought his dad was either really awesome or out of his mind.”\nThere were also changes to the linebacker coaches. Once it was set to Coach Paul Amakihe, Lampron’s career began to take off.\n“I gotta give a lot of the success that I have had to Coach A (Amakihe),” he said. “It’s been him. I have learned so much from him. Spending so much time with him, we have such a great relationship. He coaches me hard, but I wouldn’t want it any other way.”\nIn the linebacking group, two leaders are assigned to become the spark plugs, brains and the brawn of the defense.\n“As a teammate, Gideon (Lampron) is very well-liked,” Andrews said. “He plays with great effort and energy. He has very quick reaction skills so he makes a lot of impact plays. That potential has always been there, but he wasn’t always going in the right direction. Now that he has more experience, confidence under his belt and a year in our scheme, he has become more confident and that’s translating to the production that you’re seeing now.”\nDayton is 1-0. The Flyers have a bye-week in Week 2, and their next game will be against Indiana State, which played Purdue in Week 1. The Boilermarkers have Lampron’s former Keystone teammate Ryne Shackelford on their roster.\n“One thing (I’ve noticed), especially after watching the game on film is that I could have played so much better,” he said. “Now I just have to keep the same energy. I can’t keep reading my own headlines. We still have a lot more football to be played. I am not satisfied.”\nDayton’s next game is scheduled for Sept. 14, which will be broadcast on ESPN+.",
