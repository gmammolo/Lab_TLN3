  "text": "By Chelsea Leite ,\n2 hours ago The Seattle Storm already had a strong roster, but the midseason addition of Gabby Williams brings them to a higher level.\nWilliams is a world-class veteran and fits a needed role in Seattle that will help give the Storm an edge in the playoffs. The Storm already have clinched a playoff berth and are fighting for a top-four seed and home court in the first round. Every contending WNBA team boasts several stars, and Williams helps the Storm get level to the teams they’re chasing.\nWilliams was crucial to the Storm’s win against the second-place Connecticut Sun on Tuesday, with 11 points, six rebounds, five assists and a steal to go with 5-for-8 shooting from the field. The Sun are a team the Storm may end up seeing in the playoffs, so getting the win factors in as a huge confidence boost. As Williams acclimates back to WNBA basketball after the Olympics, her impact will continue to grow on Seattle’s roster.\nWilliams was drafted fourth overall out of UConn in 2018 by the Chicago Sky and spent her first three WNBA seasons with that franchise. Now, she’s in her third season with the Storm. She also has a lengthy résumé in the Euroleague and plays for the French national team.\nSeattle Storm forward Gabby Williams dribbles the ball against the New York Liberty at Climate Pledge Arena on May 29, 2022. Stephen Brashear-Imagn Images\nFans were stunned by Williams and the French when they nearly beat Team USA in the gold medal game at the Paris Olympics, ultimately falling 67-66. She averaged 14.8 points, 4.2 rebounds, 5.4 assists and 2.8 steals per game for the silver medalists.\nSeattle made some huge moves in free agency by attracting Skylar Diggins-Smith and Nneka Ogwumike. They join Jewell Loyd to lead this Storm roster, and Ezi Magbegor has blossomed into an excellent center as well. Ultimately, Williams’ veteran presence bonds well alongside Seattle’s other stars. Teams need veteran experience to succeed in the playoffs, as they usually know how to keep calm and meet the moment. Williams may not have snatched the gold medal, but she played phenomenally under pressure in Paris.\nWilliams is the kind of player who affects a game in myriad ways. She doesn’t always rack up points, but she is an elite defender and passer. On a roster where you have shooters like Loyd and Diggins-Smith in the backcourt and Ogwumike and Magbegor in the frontcourt, a passer like Williams is like glue. She’s strong enough to drive to the basket when needed and has the size to crash the glass. On the defensive side, her strength and wingspan make her a scary matchup.\nHaving a versatile player like Williams on a playoff team serves a variety of purposes — for one, a player who’s willing to do the dirty work on the court is essential. Plus, she knows the staff and team atmosphere from her previous seasons with the Storm. Seattle could not have done any better in terms of a midseason acquisition.\nWilliams might have extra motivation this postseason. Virtually every team the Storm could face in the postseason will have a member of the Team USA squad that edged out France for gold just a month ago. Maybe Williams will be playing for a WNBA championship with a little bit of redemption on the side.
