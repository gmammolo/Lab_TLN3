  "text": "The Lady Cardinals have won three matches in a row and ended Bauxite’s season opening winning streak.\nHarmony Grove Head Coach Bailey Korte says they were able to win the match in four sets. “We beat them 3-1, winning the first two sets and then dropping the third and coming back to win it in the fourth,” she said. “The girls played great. I am so proud of how they worked as a team and did things that I’ve known they were capable of, they just haven’t really showcased it yet.”\nBauxite Head Coach Dave Carter says he felt the Lady Miners let their mentality get the best of them. \"We did not do what we needed to do in order to beat a quality Cardinal team that continues to improve,” he said. “They were ready, and they did what they needed to. I feel like we went away from our plan too much, and again made unnecessary errors, especially at the wrong times, and in some ways couldn’t get out of our own way. Add that to some very nice play from their middles, and we couldn’t overcome.”\n“We didn’t have our minds where we have to in order to compete at higher levels. We have to learn and correct errors, improve our mindsets, and grow forward. We have some really tough matches coming up, so it’s now we have to step up.”\nAlthough the Lady Miners totaled 41 kills, it would not be enough to overcome the Lady Cardinals.\nCarter says the team will have to improve their serving in order to be successful. “Our serving game was okay, but Harmony Grove successfully broke our serve well, which neutralized our service attack much more than I am happy with,” he said. “We have to serve better, but also serve effectively. After last week’s poor serving, we improved with fewer errors. I am happy about that, but our focus is both in and tough. We were in more on serves, but not tough enough. “\nKorte says the key to their win was focusing on what they know. “They wanted to win and it was obvious,” said Korte. “We stuck with what we knew and made good adjustments each set.”\nCarter says the team will have to improve their serving in order to be successful. “Our serving game was okay, but Harmony Grove successfully broke our serve well, which neutralized our service attack much more than I am happy with,” he said. “We have to serve better, but also serve effectively.
