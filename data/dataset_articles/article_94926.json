  "text": "One of the greatest treats baseball can provide you is the list of players needed to get through a season. Some of you probably remember Tyler Cyr, Damon Jones, or Hyun Soo Kim.\nYou’ll find many of these castoffs on rebuilding teams, specifically in the first year. The new front office hasn’t been able to establish a young core and need players to get through a season. For example, the 32-109\nChicago White Sox have used 61 players this season.\nThis Marlins team is no exception. After an 84-win season that made the playoffs last year, new President of Baseball Operations Peter Bendix is in a rebuilding mindset, trying to turn the Marlins into a completely different type of fish from Florida.\nYou will see some players who could be here for the long haul but this is mostly a cast of vagabond players who are getting opportunities other clubs might’ve never offered.\nThe Core\nThe club does feature a handful of promising young infielders for the future. Xavier Edwards was acquired in November of 2022 from the\nTampa Bay Rays because of rule-five restrictions and has now become the primary leadoff option for Skip Schumaker.\nHis power was always a question coming up and he possesses a .085 ISO but carries a short stroke and elite plate discipline. His .840 OPS and 22 stolen bases make him a solid offensive threat.\nJake Burger has had a Nick Castellanos-like offensive season. His first three months were a disaster with a .601 OPS as a bat-first third baseman who should probably DH. He’s since turned a major corner with a .952 OPS since the start of July.\nMike Elias needs to stop acquiring washed-up NL East pitchers because Craig Kimbrel will almost certainly cost Baltimore a playoff game, Gregory Soto has an ERA over 6, and Trevor Rogers got demoted to AAA.\nBendix took advantage of Elias’s soft heart and stole Connor Norby, who’s smashing a .984 OPS in his first 14 games with the Fish.\nKyle Stowers was another member of Bendix’s heist in Maryland but started on the wrong foot with his new club. In his first 20 games, Stowers struck out 26 times in 70 plate appearances with just a .341 OPS.\nHe’s found new life over his last ten games, hitting .314 with a .968 OPS.\nStay Loose and Sexy Reunion\nAfter Dave Dombrowski broke up the best band in Philadelphia history by trading Cristian Pache to Baltimore, they reunited in Philadelphia on August 13. Pache went 0 for 3 with three strikeouts.\nWith Ranger Suárez going on Thursday, it’s easy to assume we get a reunion with Pache in the lineup. He’s struggled with the Marlins with a .522 OPS but has played sharp defense in center field.\nTime Flies By\nRemember Jeff Conine? Pick 22 in the 1992 expansion draft by the then Florida Marlins who went on to win a\nWorld Series a few years later? His son is now a member of the Marlins and making an impact.\nGriffin Conine has been one of the few feel-good stories for the club this year and he’s come through with some instant offense. Through his first 26 plate appearances, he has a 117 OPS+, and this blast back in San Francisco.\nGRIFFIN CONINE'S FIRST MAJOR LEAGUE HOMER— Miami Marlins (@Marlins)\n[#MarlinsBeisbol] [pic.twitter.com/a6vly98zcA] [September 1, 2024]\nRemember the Giancarlo Stanton trade?\nAfter winning the 2017 National League MVP, the Marlins made the completely rational decision to move on from one of the best players in franchise history because he was making more than the league minimum.\nThe trade netted Starlin Castro, pitcher Jorge Guzmán, and infielder José Devers. Castro played two full seasons with a 97 OPS+, Guzmán pitched less than three total innings for the Marlins, and Devers had a 69 OPS+ in 2021 in 46 plate appearances.\nAfter spending nearly three full seasons in the Marlins minor league system, Devers is back with the club in September. He’s one for four with a single.\nThe Schlock\nDerek Hill is on his third team of the season, starting with the\nTexas Rangers, then getting claimed by the San Francisco Giants, and now landing here. He started strong but has struggled since being acquired by the Marlins with an 88 OPS+ overall.\nDavid Hensley was a part of the 2022\nHouston Astros World Series team, getting two singles in seven at-bats that series against the Phillies. Connor Brogdon struck him out on a changeup.\nConnor Brogdon, Wicked Changeups.— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja)\n5Ks in 2 ip.\n[pic.twitter.com/D9BrhqOxI6] [November 4, 2022]\nAdam Oller pitched for the\nOakland Athletics the prior two seasons with a 7.09 ERA in 28 games. His delivery has a little bit of funk and he’s developed a nasty slurve. Opponents have a 39.1% whiff rate on it in his three solid starts as a Marlin. He’s scheduled to start on Thursday.\nNew career-high 8 strikeouts for Adam Oller tonight (and he's still cruising)— Fish On First (@FishOnFirst)\n[pic.twitter.com/4xGaenxb0r] [August 31, 2024]\nNot to be confused with the FanGraphs writer Michael Baumann, Mike Baumann is a right-handed reliever for the Marlins who throws 97 miles per hour but doesn’t know where it’s going. It’s an ongoing Twitter joke.\nJonah Bride spent the last two seasons with Oller in Oakland and hit just .192 in 293 plate appearances. He’s given the Marlins league-average production at first base and took Tyler Phillips deep back in Philadelphia.\nXzavion Curry pitched in 52 games and started 15 for the\nCleveland Guardians over the last three years with a 4.45 ERA. He’s a right-handed option out of the Marlins bullpen.\nAustin Kitchen is a left-handed reliever who has spent most of his professional career in the\nColorado Rockies organization before making his big league debut this year with the Marlins. He has a funny name.\nCan a real organization hire Skip Schumaker this off-season?\nIn early April,\nthe Marlins voided Skip Schumaker’s club option for 2025. He will be a free agent after the season and I hope a team with serious hopes for winning gives him a shot.\nHis first year with the Marlins was an overwhelming success. They made the playoffs despite injuries to Sandy Alcántara and Eury Pérez, leading to Schumaker taking home the Manager of the Year award for 2023.\nHis roster had just five hitters with an OPS+ above 100 and they won 84 games despite a -57 run differential.\nHe passed the eye test whenever I saw him manage. He knew when to pull his starting pitcher for the most part and when to use a hitter off the bench. He did a solid job of taking advantage of matchups with his bullpen. It was a very sound job which is all you want from the position.\nHe’s not a perfect manager and I would prefer Rob Thomson on the Phillies but they won’t be looking for a new one. If you’re looking for a new manager and want to be a serious team next season, call Schumaker so he doesn’t land with the White Sox.\nTheir 2010 uniforms were underrated.\nTheir late 90s uniforms are classics and will be worn Friday night of this series but their uniforms from the mid-2010s were also great.\n[September 5, 2024]\nI liked the vibe these jerseys gave off. The white ones looked clean, the greys weren’t terrible, the black ones brought out the orange well, and even the orange jerseys were ok. They’re certainly an upgrade over what the club has worn since.",
