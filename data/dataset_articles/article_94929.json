  "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nPop superstar Taylor Swift is reportedly expected to attend the NFL Kickoff Game at Arrowhead Stadium in support of her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce , Thursday (September 5) night, \"a source briefed on the security arrangements\" at the stadium confirmed to the Athletic .\nSwift attended several of Kelce's games last season and during the playoffs, which included flying from Tokyo after the completion of her 'Eras Tour' concert to Las Vegas for the Chiefs' Super Bowl LVIII victory against the San Francisco 49ers. Kelce and Swift, both 34, initially went public with their relationship when she attended his game against the Chicago Bears at Arrowhead Stadium last September . The three-time Super Bowl champion famously revealed that he attempted to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number when he attended her concert at Arrowhead Stadium prior to their relationship last summer.\nSwift later said that Kelce \"very adorably put me on blast\" when he acknowledged the situation on his New Heights podcast , which she said \"was metal as hell\" while being featured as Time Magazine 's 'Person of the Year' in December 2023. The Chiefs enter the upcoming 2024 NFL season coming off their back-to-back Super Bowl victories and their third in five seasons.\nKelce signed an extension that will pay him an average annual salary of $17.125 million during the next two seasons , having previously been set to make $12 million in 2024 and $16.25 during the 2025 season. The 34-year-old currently ranks fourth among NFL tight ends in both career receptions (907) and receiving yards (11,328), as well as sixth in receiving touchdowns (74) entering his 12th NFL season.\nThe Chiefs will host the Baltimore Ravens in the NFL Kickoff Game at Arrowhead Stadium Thursday night as they look to three-peat as Super Bowl champions.",
