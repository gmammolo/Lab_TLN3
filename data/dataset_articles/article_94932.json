  "text": "Angola netted a late strike to secure a shock 1-0 win against Black Stars of Ghana in their first game in Group F of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in Kumasi on Thursday.\nThe defeat was a big blow to Ghana’s long-standing dominance at the Baba Yara Stadium, ending the Black Stars’ 24-year unbeaten home record there.\nFelicio Milson emerged as the hero for Angola, scoring a dramatic 93rd-minute goal that not only secured the win but also shocked the home crowd.\nDespite Ghana controlling much of the game, Milson’s late strike from close range after Ghanaian defender Abdul Mumin cleared the ball into his path sealed the upset.\nThe other two teams that make up Group F alongside Ghana and Angola are Niger Republic and Sudan.\nIn their own opening fixture, Sudan also secured a 1-0 home win against Niger Republic.\nCoach Otto Addo and his players would hope to bounce back from the disappointing home loss when they will be guests to Niger on Monday, September 9th.",
