Valerio-Bodon, who competed for the Lakers in the Summer League, impressed the team enough to earn a contract.\nThe Hungarian-born shooting guard, who previously played for the Boston Celtics in the Summer League last year, had a brief stint with the Lakers’ main squad in October before being reassigned to the South Bay Lakers, the team’s G-League affiliate.\nAccording to Forbes.hu , before Valerio-Bodon, only one other Hungarian player, Kornél Dávid, had played in the association. Dávid was active between 1999 and 2001 with the Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, Toronto Raptors, and Detroit Pistons.\nThe National Basketball Association preseason for the 2024-25 season starts on 4 October, with the Lakers facing the Minnesota Timberwolves. The regular season will run from 22 October 2024 to 13 April 2025.\nThe Lakers, who last claimed the NBA title in 2020, made the playoffs in the past two seasons but were stopped both times by the Denver Nuggets.\nRead also:\nSensational: Hungarian Luca Ekler clinches gold at Paris Paralympics!
