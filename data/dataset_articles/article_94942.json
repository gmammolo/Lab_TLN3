  "text": "Tom Banton smashed 75 off just 43 balls to set up a Somerset victory over Northamptonshire and send the reigning champions into Vitality Blast Finals Day. Banton hit five sixes and six fours as Somerset racked up an intimidating 215 for three at a sold-out Wantage Road. Banton was the dominant partner in a stand of 125 in 11.3 overs with Tom Kohler-Cadmore, who hit 63 off 43 balls with two fours and five sixes. Steelbacks captain David Willey led a spirited run chase, contributing 57 off 39 deliveries but with Somerset skipper Lewis Gregory taking three for 35 the target ultimately proved beyond their reach as they closed 17 runs short. Earlier, Willey struck in the second over to have Will Smeed (six) caught behind. Banton was aggressive from the outset as Somerset ended the powerplay on 49 for one. Banton punished a loose Freddie Heldreich over with consecutive sixes over deep midwicket, reaching his half-century off 31 balls. Banton's departure came as Justin Broad held onto the ball on the boundary before tossing it to George Bartlett to complete the catch as he stepped over the rope. Kohler-Cadmore went on to reach his half-century off 38 balls and it took a spectacular diving catch from Saif Zaib at deep midwicket to finally remove the Somerset man. Sean Dickson (33) and Lewis Gregory (20) shared a stand of 44 in the last 3.4 overs. Northamptonshire lost George Bartlett in Craig Overton's opening over with a chip to midwicket. Northamptonshire made a strong start in their reply as they finished the powerplay on 52 for one. Ricardo Vasconcelos (30) was caught at fine leg off Gregory, but after a slow start, Broad (29) hit his straps, scooping Ben Green for six and four off consecutive balls and pulling the next delivery for another boundary. The Steelbacks reached 92 for two after 10 overs ahead of Somerset, but still behind the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern equation. Broad reverse swept Roelof van der Merwe for four and six to keep the scoreboard ticking but fell in tame fashion giving Gregory a straightforward return catch. Zaib (32) picked up the baton, sending a Green delivery over fine leg and dissecting the field with great precision, while Willey brought up his half-century off 35 balls. Northamptonshire started the last five overs needing 79 to win and Zaib swung Gregory high over fine leg for six before becoming Gregory's third wicket when he skied a catch to mid-on. Willey continued to press, hitting Ball down the ground before he was caught on the cover boundary. Agar (28*) smashed a four and consecutive sixes off the final over but it was in vain as Northamptonshire fell short by 17 runs. Somerset will face Surrey in the semi-finals, hoping for a repeat of last year where they beat them before winning the final",
