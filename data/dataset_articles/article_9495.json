  "text": "KATHMANDU: In the wake of devastation caused by the flashflood in Rasuwa district, bordering the northern neighbour, Minister for Energy, Water Resource and Irrigation, Dipak Khadka, has insisted on establishing an effective coordination with Chinese government to minimize damages from disasters.\n“As many rivers flow from northern neighbour China to Nepali territory, coordination and collaboration with China is essential to minimize the impact of river floods and landslides in Nepal,” Khadka said during a ministry level discussion on Thursday. The discussion dwelt on preparedness and management of monsoon related disaster.\nMinister Khadka reminded, “There was no rainfall neither the breach of lake. But why was there a flash flood in the Bhotekoshi in Rasuwa district? If the siren was\ninstalled by the Weather Forecasting Division, information on the disaster could be received on time so as to reduce damages,” he stressed. The Minister argued although proper system for data and information was repeatedly raised in the ministry, it was not put into practice, creating such problems.\nAccording to Nepal government has given priority to the conservation of glacial lake. If the glacial lakes in China burst, it poses serious threats to Nepal. So, coordination with Chinese side is necessary, he underlined.\nThe Minister, however, said, “The government is facing resources crunch. We need early warning system in place. If such facility is ensured in the projects like hydropower to canals, it would help minimize damages.”\nHe directed the subordinates and concerned officials to move ahead by forming a committee to make smooth the preparedness.\nSimilarly, he informed that he would hold a discussion with Finance Ministry to allow discount on import of materials used for reconstruction of infrastructures damaged by the landslides and floods. He urged the employees to work in a way to ensures results that satisfies service seekers.\nMinistry Secretary Sarita Dawadi said time has come to add stations in mountainous and hilly regions for early warning system. The activities relating to disaster in the ministry need an integrated approach to address the problems, she reminded.\nOn the occasion, Executive Director at NEA, Hitendra Dev Shakya, said the floods in Bhotekoshi caused a huge damage in hydropower- Rasuwagadhi, Chilime, Trishuli-III (B).\nOther speakers in the discussion underlined the need of reinforcing coordination at all three tiers of government.",
