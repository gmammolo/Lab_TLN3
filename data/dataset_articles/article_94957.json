  "text": "American tennis star Frances Tiafoe is back in the semifinals of the US Open. The 20rh seeded Tiafoe advanced to the semifinals with a victory over Grigor Dimitrov, who had to stop playing due to injury in the fourth set of their quarterfinal match. Tiafoe led two sets to one and was up 4-1 in the fourth set at the time of the stoppage. It is the second time in three years that Tiafoe has advanced to the semifinal of the US Open. He advanced to the Final Four in 2022 when he was defeated by eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz of Spain. Tiafoe’s opponent in the semifinals will be fellow American Taylor Fritz, who is the No. 12 seed. Fritz defeated No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in four sets to advance to his first major semifinal. The Tiafoe-Fritz semifinal match will take place on Friday at 2 p.m. at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows, N.Y. For the first time in 18 years, an American will be guaranteed a spot in the championship of the tournament. Andy Roddick was the last American to play in the semifinals of the US Open in 2006. Tiafoe and Fritz have met seven times in the professional ranks with Fritz holding a 6-1 lead. *Young and Townsend advanced to mixed doubles finals Americans Donald Young and Taylor Townsend have advanced to the championship match of the mixed doubles competition. The Americans will face the Italian team of Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori today at Arthur Ashe Stadium, beginning at 2 p.m. (St. Louis time). Young and Townsend defeated Aldila and Rohan Bopanna in straight sets in the quarterfinals on Tuesday. The US Open is a swan song for Young, 35, who has already announced his retirement from professional tennis. Thursday’s championship match will be his final one as a pro. Young and Townsend were extended a wild card entry into the tournament and they have made the most of it with their run to the championship match. Townsend, 28, is seeking her second Grand Slam championship of the year. In July, she and Daterina Siniakova won the women’s doubles championship at Wimbledon. She has competed in a Grand Slam doubles final in each of the past three years with one title and two runner-up finishes.",
