  "text": "LeBron TR1 Transcends Disciplines in Versatile Training Silhouette\nWEBWIRE– Thursday, September 5, 2024\nWhat to know\n- LeBron James’ new silhouette, the LeBron TR1 (Trainer 1), is engineered to be the training shoe for the next generation of athletes, blending best-in-class performance with premier comfort and a youthful emphasis on street sensibility.\n- Redefining the meaning of training shoe stability, the TR1 features an ergonomic and lightweight design that emphasizes forefoot flexibility.\n- The silhouette reflects LeBron’s holistic approach to training and represents new spaces in his partnership with Nike.\n- The TR1 will be available globally at\nnike.comand select retailers September 19.\nAs one of the most multi-dimensional athletes of our time, LeBron James approaches his training the same way he attacks the rim: with an unrivaled tenacity and deep-seeded drive that puts him a cut above the rest, in a class of his own.\nLeBron has channeled that intensity into his first training shoe, the LeBron TR1 — a silhouette that transcends disciplines with an innovative blend of performance and style that helps athletes break barriers and shatter expectations.\nRedefining the meaning of training shoe stability, the TR1 features an ergonomic and lightweight design that emphasizes forefoot flexibility and delivers best-in-class performance.\nDesigners removed the strobel, or the lowermost portion of the shoe’s upper, allowing the athlete to be closer to the foam cushioning that gives the TR1 its hallmark responsiveness. An inverted waffle outsole created specifically for the TR1 leverages insights from the Nike Sport Research Lab to provide traction where athletes need it most and a sleeker design where they don’t, driving indoor performance and outdoor versatility.\nA wide last and glove-like bootie construction provide room for athletes’ feet to swell during training, and a daring midsole wrap drives stability, containment and comfort in a striking design meant to be worn outside of the gym.\nLeBron emphasized style and all-day wearability throughout the design process, appealing to multisport athletes seeking a versatile shoe that delivers both top-tier performance and bold street sensibility. The silhouette reflects LeBron’s holistic approach to training and represents new spaces in his partnership with Nike.\nThe LeBron TR1 will be available globally at\nnike.com and select retailers September 19.\n( Press Release Image:\nhttps://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/8/326459/326459-1.png )\nWebWireID326459\nThis news content was configured by WebWire editorial staff.
