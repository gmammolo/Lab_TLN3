  "text": "Super Eagles winger Moses Simon says the team is condemned to beat Benin in Saturday’s 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.\nRecall that Nigeria will be going for revenge after losing 2-1 to Benin in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier.\nSpeaking with NFFTV, the Nantes star stated that the Super Eagles will be desperate to overcome the Cheetah at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, Uyo, in a bid to put a smile on the faces of Nigerians.\n“I missed my Super Eagles teammates, and I am happy to be back to my roots. The mood was a little bit up because coach Eguavoen knows a lot of the players and the role they have to play.\nRead Also: AFCON 2025Q: Super Eagles Determined To Make Great Start — Eguavoen\n“He gave confidence to the players. He’s the coach, and we don’t know his tactics or how they will work. You can find the best players sitting on the bench. So I believe the coach knows better than we do. He has not been out of the team despite the fact that he’s not the coach. But he’s within the team because he’s working for the federation.\n“This is our job, and we know what is at stake. Of course, we lost against Benin 2-1, and I believe we don’t want another loss or a draw against them again. I know we always beat them, and this one won’t be an exemption. The guys know what they have to do to win. We are not going there for a draw or fighting a war.\n“We will approach the game with the sole aim of winning and put a smile on the faces of Nigerians. As a Nigerian, we always feel sad each time the team doesn’t win. Even though the players gave their best, their best may not be enough.”",
