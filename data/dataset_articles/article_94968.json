ASHWAUBENON – Live music and a Q&A with former [Green Bay Packers](https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/football/nfl/teams/green-bay-packers/335) star receivers James Jones and Greg Jennings will be part of the team's watch party Friday at Titletown. The watch party is for the Packers- [Philadelphia Eagles](https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/football/nfl/teams/philadelphia-eagles/354) game at 7:15 p.m. Friday in São Paulo, Brazil. The event is free, but requires registration, which can be completed at [titletown.com/events/titletown-watch-party.](https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/55YRCERXz9S0Rz59RSPQZ7o?domain=u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net) The event begins at 5 p.m. at Ariens Hill in Titletown, when the band [Road Trip](https://www.roadtripband.com/) will play. A Q&A period and meet-and-greet with Jones and Jennings will follow. Attendees can reserve spots on the hill by placing blankets and lawn chairs on the hill starting at 4 p.m. Seating is first-come, first-served. A large-screen will be at the base of the hill.
