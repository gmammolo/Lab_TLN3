  "text": "For a third consecutive year, a UWM player has been chosen in the Major League Baseball draft.\nOwen Rice, a pitcher,\nwas chosen in the 20th round on Tuesday by the St. Louis Cardinals, becoming the 26th UWM player selected by a major league organization in program history.\n“Today is an exciting day for Owen as he gets to realize his dream of being drafted into professional baseball by the St. Louis Cardinals,” UWM head coach Shaun Wegner said. “We all knew from the first bullpen session he threw in the fall of 2022 that he possessed the physical traits and physique to be a pro.”\nUWM player Riley Frey was in picked in 2023 by the Atlanta Braves, and AJ Blubaugh was chosen 2022 by the Houston Astros.\nBlubaugh has risen rapidly through the minor leagues and stands at the cusp of the majors. Astros general manager Dana Brown said last week that Blubaugh\ncould be promoted to the big league club very soon.\nIf that happens, he would join Daulton Varsho as the only UWM players in the major leagues. Varsho was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2017, and now plays outfield for the Toronto Blue Jays.",
