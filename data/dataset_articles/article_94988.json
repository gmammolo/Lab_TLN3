  "text": "In their 52-0 Week One win over Colorado State, the Texas Longhorns impressed across many across the country. That includes four-star safety Isaiah Williams who has not committed to a school yet. The Fort Bend Marshall product was originally schedule to visit Texas A&M but decided to visit Austin with teammate Caleb Chester and liked what he saw.\n“It was good. It was domination, what I expected,” Williams told Orangebloods Writer/ Editor Jason Suchomel . “It was a good game, good atmosphere. I had a good time all around.”\nWhile Williams has yet to finalize his list of schools, Texas has a strong chance to make his final list. Other programs that have made an offer include Baylor, Arizona State, Florida, and Ohio State. Rivals ranks him as the 23rd-best safety in the 2026 class.\nDuring the recruiting process, Texas has been hard at work building a relationship with Williams, which was on display during his surprise stop in Austin.\n“I talked to coach (Blake) Gideon, Sark, coach Terry Joseph after the game and before the game,” Williams told Suchomel. “They were just telling me that they want me, once again, I’m a top priority. They’re just waiting on me now. We’re still trying to build that relationship to the next level. It’s all coming together now.”\nThe Longhorns’ focus now is on ensuring that Williams decides to spend his college career in Austin.\nFollow all of your favorite Texas teams at Longhorns Wire , Cowboys Wire , Texans Wire , Rockets Wire , Aggies Wire and the Austin American-Statesman !",
