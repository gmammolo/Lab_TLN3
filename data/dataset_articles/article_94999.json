  "text": "By Jake Faigus ,\n2 hours ago\nJim Harbaugh is back in the NFL, and he’s ready to make an impact as the new head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers .\nAfter wrapping up his first training camp, he welcomed his parents to watch him lead the team during their preseason finale against the Dallas Cowboys.\nHarbaugh, who played for the Chargers in the late 1990s, is no stranger to the NFL. His coaching career has taken him from the University of San Diego to Stanford, the San Francisco 49ers, and most recently, the University of Michigan, where he achieved significant success. Now, he’s focused on building a winning culture in Los Angeles.\nSince his hiring in January, Harbaugh has emphasized hard work and dedication. He thrives in the football environment, constantly seeking challenges and opportunities to improve.\nHis enthusiasm is palpable, and it’s clear he’s excited to be back in the league.\n\"I love to work. I love working and having something to work on,\" Harbaugh said . \"I sit at my desk and hope somebody brings me something to work on.\n\"To get to do it in this kind of environment with these spectacular people, it's inspiring. It really is,\" Harbaugh continued . \"So much to do, so much to learn. I feel like I'm on my feet all day. I've got stuff to do.\nHe later added : \"Dare I say it, I'm having fun.\"\nThe Chargers organization is buzzing with energy, and the excitement is evident among fans and players alike. Team owner Dean Spanos has noted a renewed sense of optimism surrounding the franchise, attributing it to Harbaugh’s presence.\n\"This would be an understatement, but I haven't been this excited in a long time,\" Spanos said . \"I see it in the community, I see it in the organization from our staff to our players and our coaches. It's electrifying.\n\"I think Jim being here has brought a sense of awareness about our team … and I think the fans are so excited about that,\" Spanos added . \"You see it everywhere you go.\"\nAs the Chargers prepare for the 2024 season, Harbaugh brings a strong track record, boasting a winning percentage that ranks among the best in the NFL. He’s hungry for another shot at a championship after previously leading the 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance.\nWhile he recently celebrated a national title with Michigan, Harbaugh is eager to chase another championship in the NFL.\n\"I only have so many sands left in the hourglass and I want another shot,\" Harbaugh said . \"I want another shot to be simply known as World Champions. The Lombardi Trophy, that's my mission.\"\nHis competitive spirit drives him, and he’s determined to unite the team in pursuit of their goals.\nHarbaugh’s coaching staff includes familiar faces who have witnessed his leadership style firsthand. They recognize his commitment to team building and his relentless drive to succeed.\nMinter, who was with Harbaugh at Michigan, described him as \"one of the most elite leaders in all of sports.\"\n\"Some people have hobbies and different things to get their mind off things. Football is his job and his hobby,\" Minter said . \"Team building is his job and his hobby. He pours everything he has into that.\"\nRoman was asked if he thought Harbaugh would flip some sort of switch as the regular season draws near.\n\"Jim flipped the switch many years ago,\" said Roman , who was Harbaugh's offensive coordinator in San Francisco. \"And it stayed flipped. It stuck.\n\"He's going all the time. It's one of the reasons he's been so great over the years,\" Roman added . \"I don't really notice much difference, he's on all the time. That's Jim. One of the reasons we love him.\"\nAs the regular season approaches, Harbaugh’s focus remains clear. He’s not just content to be back in the NFL; he’s here to win.\nThe Chargers are gearing up for their opener against the Raiders, and Harbaugh’s passion for the game will undoubtedly motivate the team.\nWith his return, the Chargers are poised for an exciting season. Harbaugh’s dedication and experience could be the catalyst for a successful campaign in Los Angeles.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
