  "text": "Crews successfully rescued 31 people who were trapped after a tunnel collapsed in L.A.’s Wilmington neighborhood Wednesday night. The Los Angeles Fire Department responded to the industrial tunnel on the 1700 block of South Figueroa Street shortly before 8 p.m. The tunnel was filled with workers at the time, who were located 300-400 feet beneath the surface and around six miles away from the tunnel’s only access point. More than 100 LAFD responders arrived at the scene, including Urban Search and Rescue team members who were specially trained and equipped to handle confined space tunnel rescues. Some workers who were separated inside the tunnel had to climb over a 12-to 15-foot pile of loose soil to escape and join their colleagues on the other side. Sky5 footage captured the rescue efforts as they were hoisted to the surface from the tunnel, which had an 18-foot diameter. The workers stepped inside a metal compartment that was lifted by a crane to the surface. Around 9:20 p.m., all 31 workers were safely extricated and accounted for. Many were seen hugging each other. No injuries were reported as paramedics evaluated each person at the scene. The wastewater tunnel site is part of the L.A. County Sanitation District’s Clearwater Project, which spans seven miles and is being “constructed to protect local waterways by addressing aging infrastructure,” according to the project’s website. L.A. Mayor Karen Bass also arrived at the scene and released a statement on X, saying, “I just spoke with many of the workers who were trapped. Thank you to all of our brave first responders who acted immediately. You are L.A.’s true heroes.” Details are limited. The circumstances that caused the tunnel to collapse remain under investigation. This developing story will be updated. For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to KTLA.",
