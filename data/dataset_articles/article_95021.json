  "text": "Class of 2025 recruit Jasper Johnson was one of the top that UNC basketball had targeted in the class. Not only was he a top target, Johnson also had UNC in his sights as well naming them to his final five schools.\nHowever, as his decision day approached, the crystal ball started aiming in a way opposite the Tar Heels’ direction. Today, Johnson made the decision official in a verbal announcement with his family and in front of his school to commit to play at the University of Kentucky.\nHe will join his friend, Malachi Moreno, and head to his home state of Kentucky .\n🚨NEWS🚨\nJasper Johnson, the No. 12 overall recruit in the country, is going back home and has committed to the Kentucky Wildcats,per sources. pic.twitter.com/GVYXEJahUq\n— The Field of 68 (@TheFieldOf68) September 5, 2024\nThis continues to add to the recruiting woes that UNC is experiencing in this 2025 class. However, there is still hope with a chance at the No. 1 overall recruit of the class in AJ Dybantsa.\nUNC will now shift its recruiting focus to those players where they are still in the running. The Heels have yet to get a verbal commitment from anyone in the Class of 2025, and fans are still wondering who that first one will be.\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.",
