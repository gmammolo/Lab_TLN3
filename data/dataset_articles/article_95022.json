  "text": "A new Maryland state record has been established for the Yellowedge Grouper, caught by Jian Feng Li off Ocean City. On August 27, Li pulled in a remarkable 38-pound, 43-inch fish from Poorman's Canyon while fishing with fellow anglers. This catch marks the first time a Yellowedge Grouper has been recognized as a state record in Maryland's Atlantic Division and is just 10 pounds shy of the world record. The fish was officially weighed at Sunset Marina and confirmed by a Maryland Department of Natural Resources biologist.By the Numbers - Li's Yellowedge Grouper weighed 38 pounds and measured 43 inches. - Only 10 pounds lighter than the International Game Fish Association world record for Yellowedge Grouper. The catch highlights the growing interest in sport fishing in Maryland, but it also raises questions about the sustainability of bottom fishing practices and their impact on marine ecosystems.State of Play - The Maryland Department of Natural Resources oversees state records across four divisions. - Anglers looking to set records must apply and ensure their catch is handled properly for verification. As this record sets a precedent, other anglers may be motivated to pursue record catches in light of Li's success, potentially leading to increased participation in sport fishing.Bottom Line This historic catch not only showcases individual angling success but also emphasizes the need for responsible fishing practices to ensure marine resource sustainability for future records.
