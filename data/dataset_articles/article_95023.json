  "text": "Detroit Lions coordinators talk up Jameson Williams, Terrion Arnold: 'Iron sharpens iron' Dave Birkett Detroit Free Press Show Caption\nHide Caption\nLions rookie Terrion Arnold knows Matthew Stafford likely to target him Detroit Lions rookie cornerback Terrion Arnold on Thursday, Sept. 5 prepares for his first test vs. Matthew Stafford and Rams in NFL opener. Count Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson among those expecting a breakout season from wide receiver Jameson Williams this fall.\nWilliams finished sixth on the Lions with 24 catches for 354 yards last season, but is slated to play as the No. 2 receiver behind Amon-Ra St. Brown this year.\nJohnson said Thursday his confidence level in Williams is \"as high as it’s ever been and continuing to climb,\" and joined the chorus of coaches who said they've seen Williams take major steps forward on and off the field entering his third NFL season.\nBOLD WORDS: Aaron Glenn expects Lions 'to be a damn good defense' with Aidan Hutchinson starring\n\"As a player, as a route runner, as a receiver, and then off the field just his preparation, how he’s talking care of his body, his demeanor with his teammates and interactions with them,\" Johnson said. \"He’s come a very long way and so he’s just going to continue to grow and the more reps he gets he’s going to make mistakes and he’s going to learn from them and that’s the best thing, most encouraging thing we’ve seen is, since he’s been out on the field, he rarely makes the same mistake twice.”\nJohnson and fellow Lions coordinators Aaron Glenn and Dave Fipp held their weekly media sessions Thursday. Here are more highlights.\nRole reversal Glenn had good things to say about Williams, too, as well as the looks the young receiver has given his new defensive backs to help them get ready for the season.\n“Listen, iron sharpens iron in this business so the guys that we have as corners going against Jamo, I think it made both guys better,\" Glenn said. \"I expect Jamo to do what Jamo do, and that’s run past people and make plays in the deep part of the field. So, listen, I’m a huge fan of that player. Me and him have a really good relationship, and I try to push him just as much as I push anybody else because he has the talent to be able to do it. So I look forward to watching him operate this whole season.\"\nJohnson, similarly, offered praise for rookie cornerback Terrion Arnold, calling him \"sticky.\"\n\"He’s sticky as all get out, so he’s given us some issues there during training camp, one-on-ones, and we’ve tried to pick on him a little bit and it hasn’t been super successful,\" Johnson said. \"So I’m encouraged to see where he’s at. He certainly lets you know he’s out there, in more ways than one. It’s good.”\nPatience pays NFL teams have a long history of playing things safe at the kicker position. It's easier to stick with a trusted veteran than it is to develop a raw rookie, even if the young player has considerably more upside.\nThe Cincinnati Bengals did that in 2017, when they picked Randy Bullock over fifth-round pick Jake Elliott as their kicker, and Fipp was with the Philadelphia Eagles when that team signed Elliott off the Bengals' practice squad early that year. Elliott made his first Pro Bowl a few years later and was a second-team All-Pro selection last year.\nMore: Detroit Lions season preview: Depth chart, what to expect from newcomers on defense\nFipp reiterated that he and the Lions plan to have patience with young kicker Jake Bates this fall. He stressed that Bates has to \"do his part\" to keep the job, but said Bates has unique leg talent and the Lions are willing to weather some ups and downs.\n\"I’m really excited about him,\" Fipp said. \"He’s one of the most talented players I’ve been around at that position. I think all the guys on the other teams in the preseason watch him warm up and are like, ‘Oh my gosh, this guy’s incredible.’ So he has a tremendous upside, which if you’re going to invest in a player and take a chance, you definitely want to do it with a guy who can turn out to be a really good player for you. I think we have to be patient with him.\"\nBranch bouncing around Brian Branch may start at safety for the Lions this fall after playing primarily as a slot cornerback last year, but that doesn't mean he'll be anchored to only the safety position.\n\"That doesn’t mean that he’s not going to play nickel, so I want to get that out of everybody’s head right now,\" Glenn said. \"He’s going to play safety, he’s going to play nickel, he’s going to play dime, so he’s going to be all over the place and the reason why we’re doing that is because he’s a damn good player so we’re going to put him in position to make plays.\"\nBranch was one of the Lions' most productive defenders last season with 74 tackles, three interceptions and one sack. He showed advanced instincts as a rookie, and Glenn said he's been more vocal in his new role.\n\"You’re talking about a man that’s upped his communications, that upped his leadership skills as far as influencing guys,\" Glenn said. \"He’s done that and he’s done it at a high rate, in my opinion.”\nOffensive ingenuity The Lions' new-look secondary will get its first major test Sunday against a Los Angeles Rams passing game led by quarterback Matthew Stafford, with two productive receivers in Puka Nacua (105 catches, 1,486 yards, 6 TDs in 2023) and Cooper Kupp (59-737-5).\nGlenn called the Nacua-Kupp duo \"damn good\" and said their effectiveness is enhanced by the rest of the Rams' offense.\n\"I think their running back’s a hell of a player,\" Glenn said of Kyren Williams. \"Obviously we know the one that was drafted from Michigan (in Blake Corum), he’s going to be a good player, but the way that they challenge you with all the pre-snap movements and then they get to a simple play, I think he’s the epitome of, ‘Man, listen, make everything look complex, but we’re just doing simple plays.’ And I think that’s great for an offense, and (Rams coach Sean McVay) does that. So the thing that we’ve got to be good with is, ‘Don’t get caught up in all the eye candy, understand exactly who they are and how they run their plays and go make those plays.’\"\nInjury report Ifeatu Melifonwu took part in individual drills during the open portion of practice Wednesday, while D.J. Reader worked out with a sled on the side while his teammates went through position drills. Undrafted rookie Loren Strickland remains out with a thumb injury.\nDave Birkett is the author of the new book, \" Detroit Lions : An Illustrated Timeline.\" Preorder it now from Reedy Press .\nContact him at dbirkett@freepress.com .
