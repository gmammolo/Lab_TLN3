  "text": "Trevor Penning made his first career start against the Carolina Panthers as a rookie. That was at left tackle in the 2022 season. The New Orleans Saints made the decision to move Penning over to right tackle instead of Taliese Fuaga this spring, and they're sticking with it as we move towards the fall. As the Saints prepare to make their season debut with Carolina, Trevor Penning is preparing for the first start of his career at right tackle. It's a full-on 180 as this start comes in the first game opposed to the last game of the season like in 2022. Klint Kubiak made the announcement Thursday afternoon , declaring that Penning has \"earned the right to go out there and play really well on Sunday.\" Penning took the majority of the reps as the starting right tackle this summer. Olisaemeka Udoh made a late push, but it was clearly Penning's job to lose, and the coaches didn't see enough to warrant taking it from him. There have been a lot of eyes on Penning's development through the offseason. That won't stop because he was declared the starter. Kubiak made sure to emphasize the offensive line is a unit. It's the ultimate unit in football and is \"about five guys, not one.\" A microscope is on that entire retooled unit, but Penning is likely under a microscope under another microscope going into Week 1. He needs to play well and justify the trust he's been given. More 2024 season! NFL power rankings roundup: Where do Saints stand entering Week 1?
