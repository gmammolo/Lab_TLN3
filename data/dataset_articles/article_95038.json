  "text": "The Kansas City Chiefs will kick off their quest for a three-peat with the opening game of the 2024 regular season, an AFC Championship rematch against the Baltimore Ravens this evening. Every game counts moving forward, as Arrowhead Stadium will be loud and ready to celebrate last year's accomplishment and look forward to more success starting tonight. Though Kansas City will have an edge playing at home, Baltimore added some serious firepower to its offense during the offseason by signing star running back Derrick Henry, who could wreck the Chiefs' gameplan in Week 1. Check out our predictions for Kansas City's matchup against Baltimore: Ed Easton Jr.'s Prediction The Kansas City Chiefs’ regular season is officially underway with the much-anticipated matchup with the Baltimore Ravens. On banner night, a celebratory Arrowhead Stadium crowd will rock for the defending champions. Patrick Mahomes and the offense will look to get off to a fast start by showcasing the team’s new weapons. Isiah Pacheco’s consistency will be essential in the running game, as the Chiefs want to maintain a healthy balance without relying too much on Mahomes or Travis Kelce. The Ravens’ defense is talented, so the offense must avoid turnovers and poor field position. On defense, Chris Jones on the defensive line will play their first game together since Super Bowl LVIII after the All-Pro missed preseason play. The cornerback position will be the group to watch as everyone after Trent McDuffie is a question mark heading into Thursday. Special teams with the new look kickoff are also important, but the Chiefs have a former Pro Bowler in Mecole Hardman and third-year receiver Skyy Moore as viable options. The Chiefs should be solid enough to pull off the victory to start the new season and win the game. Final Score: Chiefs 28, Ravens 17 Jon Ediger's Prediction The 2024 regular season is officially here, as the Baltimore Ravens head to Kansas City to face the Chiefs in a much-anticipated Thursday night matchup. For the Ravens, banner night means revenge, after the Chiefs bested Baltimore in the AFC Championship Game earlier this year en route to their second-straight Super Bowl victory. The loss of wide receiver Marquise 'Hollywood' Brown in tonight's game could prove to be a major factor in the outcome, but given Kansas City's newfound depth at the wide receiver position, it seems likely that the former Sooner's teammates will be able to up the slack. Reigning MVP Lamar Jackson is a force to be reckoned with, and should be expected to have a big game tonight, but defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo's defense has trained all offseason for this game and will have an answer. Final Score: Chiefs 34, Ravens 23. Andrew Garcia's prediction Both of these teams got better during the offseason, and perhaps if this game was being played at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore the Ravens would have a better chance at getting revenge on Kansas City in this matchup. Given that the Chiefs will be celebrating their Super Bowl LVIII victory in front of a home crowd, it seems unlikely that the defending champions will come out flat against such a high-profile opponent, especially after their Week 1 collapse last season. Baltimore's roster is outstanding, and the Ravens have all the talent they need to pull off an upset to spoil Kansas City's party, but the Chiefs seem like the logical choice tonight. Final Score: Chiefs 13, Ravens 10 John Dillon's prediction The outcome of this matchup will come down to Kansas City's ability to contain Baltimore's new-look ground game that has All-World running back Derrick Henry paired with Lamar Jackson, who is a dynamo in his own right. Though the Chiefs have been able to contain Henry and Jackson individually in the past, this new dynamic in the Ravens' offense could prove to be too much for Kansas City to handle, and lead to disastrous results for the home team if they let Baltimore get out to an early lead. To me, this game is a toss-up, and could truly go either way. For now, though, I'll call it in the Chiefs' favor and predict a 1-0 start to Kansas City's season. Final Score: Chiefs 32, Ravens 28 More Chiefs content Check out everything you need to know to watch the Chiefs' matchup against the Ravens on Thursday night.",
