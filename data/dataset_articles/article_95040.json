  "text": "The 2024 season is about to get underway for the Los Angeles Rams , a team with Super Bowl aspirations after making it to the playoffs last year. They'll start the season with the team that ended their 2023 campaign, the Detroit Lions of the NFC North. With Matthew Stafford leading the way once again and a receiving corps as good as any in the NFL, the Rams are well-equipped to make a run this season. The defense, even without Aaron Donald, has a ton of potential thanks to the young talent up front and in the secondary. Before the season kicks off, we have eight bold predictions for the Rams in 2024. 1. Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp will each have 1,100 yards Robert Woods and Brandin Cooks each had at least 1,200 yards in 2018. The following year, Kupp and Woods each had 1,100-plus yards. Since then, however, the Rams haven't had two receivers with even 1,000 yards in the same season. Kupp and Nacua should each clear 1,000 yards receiving fairly easily this year, as long as both of them stay healthy. That's the biggest question with this receiving tandem, though. Health. With Kupp fully healthy and Nacua in excellent shape after a workout-filled offseason, I'm betting both of them will go over 1,100 yards this season. 2. Colby Parkinson will score 6 touchdowns In his career, Parkinson has four total touchdowns. He's only caught 57 passes in four years, seeing a very limited role during his time with the Seahawks. This is the season he breaks out, though. He's the biggest target Stafford has, standing 6-foot-7. He towers over the Rams' other receivers and will easily catch the eye of Stafford when the Rams are in the red zone. Yes, he's competing for targets with Nacua and Kupp, but he should get a bunch of opportunities to score this season as a red zone weapon. 3. Three players will have at least 7 sacks For the past decade, it's been the Aaron Donald show up front for the Rams. Only twice since 2017 have the Rams finished a season with three players who recorded at least seven sacks: 2019 and 2023. It's not easy to get such production out of three different players, but even without Donald, the Rams will find success rushing the passer. It'll just come from several different sources instead of primarily one player. Byron Young and Kobie Turner are both good bets to finish with at least seven sacks after posting eight and nine, respectively, in 2023. The Rams would then need just one of Jared Verse or Braden Fiske to also post seven sacks. My money is on Verse, who will have ample pass-rushing opportunities opposite Young. It wouldn't be a surprise if all four players finish with at least five or six sacks. 4. Blake Corum will lead all rookies in rushing yards It's no guarantee that Kyren Williams will miss time at some point this season, but there's probably a good chance he'll be sidelined for at least a game or two when you consider his injury history and the physical nature of the position. Even if Williams doesn't get hurt, Corum has a decent chance to finish atop the rookie rushing chart. The Rams clearly want to get him involved and if he has the hot hand early in the year, Sean McVay may not be able to resist rising the rookie over Williams. 5. Matthew Stafford will finish top 5 in MVP voting For the first time last season, Stafford received MVP votes. He finished eighth in the race to win the coveted award, but he'll improve on that this year. I'm just not willing to go out on a limb and say he'll win MVP. That would require him to put up gaudy numbers and likely the Rams to finish first in the NFC. Even a top-five finish in polling for MVP would be an accomplishment for Stafford. It would show he's still one of the five best quarterbacks in the NFL, even at the age of 36. 6. Rams will win the NFC West The 49ers are once again heavy favorites to win the division, which is understandable given the talent they have across the roster. But the Rams are built to take them on this season, more so than they have been in recent years. This is a physical offensive line with a ton of power, leading the way for two smaller backs who could get lost behind the wall of blockers in front of them. Defensively, their line is loaded with young talent and players who don't take a play off. The 49ers are still top of the class, but there are questions about their depth. If they suffer injuries at running back, wide receiver or tight end, they could be in serious trouble. 7. Jared Verse is named Defensive Rookie of the Year Turner almost won Defensive Rookie of the Year last season with his nine sacks. Young was even in the running after he had eight sacks. This year, it's Verse's turn to avenge that loss by Turner and win the award himself. He was a first-round pick who was drafted into a perfect situation with the Rams. Sure, he'd be better set up for success if he had Donald drawing double-teams on the interior, but Verse should still approach 10 sacks, if not eclipse that number. 8. At least six Rams will make the Pro Bowl While there are no locks for the Pro Bowl on the Rams' roster this year, there are a lot of strong candidates. At wide receiver, Nacua and Kupp are both very good picks. Steve Avila at guard is another one after he played every snap last season. Stafford should make the Pro Bowl again if he plays the way he did in 2023. Defensively, Turner, Quentin Lake, Tre'Davious White and Kamren Curl could all earn consideration for the Pro Bowl.",
