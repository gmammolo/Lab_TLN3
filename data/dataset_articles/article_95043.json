  "text": "ITYT: Deep Dive - How the Texas Longhorns beat the Michigan Wolverines\nIan Boyd and Paul Wadlington explain how the No. 3 Texas Longhorns march into the Big House in Ann Arbor, Mich. and take down the No. 10 Michigan Wolverines in the latest episode of the Deep Dive.\n[[Use promo code HOOKEM and get 50 PERCENT off annual memberships!]]https://www.on3.com/teams/texas-longhorns/join/\nTexas plans to dominate Michigan by aggressively passing the ball early and often. The goal is to apply pressure through a fast tempo, causing Michigan to abandon their slow, methodical offense.\nMichigan’s defense, known for heavy blitzing, aims to pressure Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers. Texas will counter this by using quick RPO (Run-Pass Option) plays to neutralize the blitz.\nTexas aims to exploit Michigan’s relatively weaker secondary by spreading out their receivers and using mismatches to find openings, especially against non-Will Johnson defenders.\nMichigan will likely anticipate Texas’ tactics and counter with trick plays and misdirection early in the game. The Longhorns must be cautious and adapt after Michigan’s scripted opening plays.\nMichigan’s tight end Colston Loveland poses a major threat due to his size, speed, and ability to find space. Texas will need to focus on containing him, especially in critical moments like third downs and the red zone.\nThis video is brought to you by Gabe Winslow.
