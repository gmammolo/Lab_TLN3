  "text": "The historic arts campus sustained over $1 million in damage, but its team is already working to restore theater spaces and community programs.\nCBS News reports that The Hill Country Arts Foundation in Ingram, Texas, is facing a massive rebuilding effort following deadly flooding that struck the region over the July 4 holiday weekend.\nFounded 66 years ago along the banks of the Guadalupe River, the foundation is home to a theater, art fair, and replica of Stonehenge. For Executive Director Sarah Tacey - who has worked at the site for 25 years - it’s more than a performance venue. “It means something to so many people,” she told CBS News. “People who were out here in their cribs are now directing plays and starring in plays.”\nSeveral facilities on the campus were inundated by floodwaters, including the black box theater, the lobby, and a ceramics studio that had only recently been completed. The outdoor theater’s stage survived thanks to a built-in safeguard: walls intentionally designed to break away in the event of a major flood, preventing the entire structure from being washed downstream.\nDespite the extensive damage - estimated to cost over $1 million to repair - teams are already working to clear debris and restore the site.\n“Everyone at the foundation lost loved ones or knows someone who did,” Tacey said. “The community needs some joy and music and we’ll do it in some fashion and invite the community to come here.”\nThe theater was set to be currently presenting Jimmy Buffett's Escape to Margaritaville through July 26th, 2025. Other summer productions expected to be impacted include Shipwrecked!, Hot Shakespeare, an Evening of One Acts, and Dial M For Murder.\nThe theater was also expected to present A Christmas Carol during the holiday season.\nTo learn more about how you can help and donate, click here.\nVideos",
