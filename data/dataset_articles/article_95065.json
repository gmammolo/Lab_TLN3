  "text": "By Nazario Pangallo ,\n2 hours ago\nLast weekend , Nate Oats and his Alabama basketball coaching staff began their fall wave of recruiting visits as multiple 2025 recruits came to Tuscaloosa.\nThe Crimson Tide is gaining momentum in all of those prospects' recruitment but none of their decisions are set to come anytime soon.\nOne player wrapped up his recruitment Thursday afternoon when he chose his college destination.\nFive-star guard Jasper Johnson announced his commitment to the University of Kentucky, becoming brand new head coach Mark Pope's second commit in the 2025 recruiting class.\n`\nJohnson was being pursued by Louisville, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Alabama and took visits to Lexington, Chapel Hill, and Tuscaloosa.\nThe No. 10 player in the country according to The 247Sports Composite grew up right outside of Lexington and has ties to Pope but Oats made a late push to make the Wildcats sweat a little bit.\nJohnson, the No. 2 overall shooting guard in his class plays for Overtime Elite in Atlanta, Ga.\nThe six-foot-four, 170-pound lefty can get his in any circumstance and is elite with the ball in his hands. Whether it's the three-point shot, mid-range, or being crafty around the basket, Johnson owns the ability to put the offense on his back.\nJohnson becomes just the second top-15 recruit in his class to decide along with five-star guard Darius Acuff Jr., who chose former Kentucky coach John Calipari's Arkansas Razorbacks.\nAlong with four-star center Malachi Moreno, Johnson is a part of a 2025 recruiting class that ranks in the top 10 for Kentucky.\nOats and the Crimson Tide are still looking for their first pledge in the 2025 cycle.\nRelated: Alabama To Host Three Top 100 Recruits\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
