  "text": "September 5, 2024 – Portugal beat Croatia 2-1 in the Nations League opener in Lisbon on Thursday.\nThe Croatia national team played the first match of this Nations League season against Portugal at the Benfica stadium in Lisbon. Last season in the Nations League, Croatia reached the final, where they lost to Spain on penalties.\nCroatia is in a delicate situation heading into this campaign – weakened by injuries, coming off a poor tournament in Germany, new retirements, and a generational change. Coach Zlatko Dalić did not have much time to work with his new starting 11, and Croatia kicked off a new era in a competition in which every point matters.\nLineups\nCroatia: Livaković – Šutalo, Pongracić, Gvardiol – Jakić, Modrić, Kovačić, Sosa – Baturina – Pašalić, Kramarić\nPortugal: Diogo Costa – Dalot, Rúben Dias, Inácio, Nuno Mendes – Vitinha, Bruno Fernandes, Pedro Neto – Bernardo Silva, Rafael Leão, Ronaldo\nMatch report\nIt was a shaky start for Croatia with Bruno Fernandes getting a shot already in the 6th minute, which Livakovic saved. A minute later, Dalot found the back of the net for Portugal as Croatia’s defense struggled to work with the new formation. It was 1-0 for Portugal.\nCroatia had their first corner in the 11th minute which Portugal knocked out for a quick counter. Livakovic came out from the penalty area to defend.\nModric hit the side netting in the 14th minute and Croatia started with their attacking game. Kramaric shot wide and had another chance which went out for a corner.\nIn the 34th minute, Portugal made it 2-0 with a goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, the 900th of his career.\nBut not all hope was lost, and just seven minutes later, Sosa’s shot was deflected by Dalot and went into the goal for 2-1!\nPortugal hit the crossbar with a minute to go in the first half, which ended 2-1.\nDalic started the second half with Caleta-Car in for Pograncic.\nPasalic forced Croatia’s first corner of the second half in the 49th minute, which was saved by Costa.\nThere were some scary moments for Croatia in the first 15 minutes of the second half, with Livakovic having to dish out a few stellar saves. Dalic subbed off Baturina for Matanovic in the 61st minute and Pasalic came off for Luka Sucic in the 68th.\nDalic subbed off Modric for Petar Sucic and Jakic for Perisic in the 76th minute.\nWith Matanovic in the game, Croatia had a new target. He shot just wide after a perfect Sucic cross into the box, and had another chance with his head off Perisic’s ball in.\nSucic launched the ball to the far post in the 89th minute, but Kramaric hit the side of the goal. Four minutes of injury time were added – and Croatia was pressing.\nCroatia was not able to equalize, though they had many chances to finish the game. The match ended 2-1 for Portugal.\nCroatia and Poland meet next on Sunday in Osijek!",
