  "text": "Luke Joseph September 5, 2024 The outside of Breslin Center on Jan. 23, 2023. — Photo by Audrey Richardson | The State News A bustling agenda at Breslin Center this fall will feature an NBA exhibition game for the third time since 2000.\nThe Detroit Pistons and Phoenix Suns will square off in the epicenter of Michigan State basketball in a preseason game Tuesday, Oct. 8 at 7 p.m., the teams announced Wednesday.\nActuarial science junior Tycen Frohriep is a proponent of the matchup on MSU's campus.\n“I honestly think it's an amazing idea,\" Frohriep said. \"Having two NBA teams come onto campus is great for the basketball culture that already exists at MSU.”\nThe preseason slate will be a homecoming of sorts for Mat Ishbia, former MSU basketball walk-on and owner of the Suns. Ishbia played at MSU under Tom Izzo from 1999-2002, a member of the 2000 team that won a national championship.\nIshbia would later join the Michigan-based mortgage lender United Wholesale Mortgage, now UWM Holdings, founded by his father, Jeff, in 1986. Ishbia became CEO in 2013 and has an current estimated net worth of 13 billion dollars, according to Forbes.\nIn 2023, Ishbia bought the Suns and the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury for four billion dollars.\n“I think it's cool to see (the announcement). Obviously, the Suns are now owned by Mat Ishbia, so it's exciting to see how the alumni come here and connect and continue to do stuff at the university,\" journalism senior Evan Katz said.\nIshbia isn't the only member of the Suns coming home in early October, as all-star guard and Grand Rapids native Devin Booker will make the trip to East Lansing. Booker, who played at Grandville High School, has talked about idolizing Izzo and MSU basketball as a kid. In fact, he nearly committed to play for the Spartans before choosing Kentucky.\nJournalism senior Garrett Hearl said he thinks Oct. 8 will draw positive attention to the university.\n“I think it's a cool opportunity, a lot of people might come to the Breslin for a unique experience,” Hearl said.\nBasketball fans will have the opportunity to experience the sport at its highest level at a premier destination in college hoops.\nREAD MORE FOOTBALL Preview: MSU football faces early season Big Ten test against Maryland Kaspar Haehnle",
