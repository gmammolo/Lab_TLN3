His father, Dennis Johnson, played football at Kentucky under Hal Mumme and his grandfather is the late Alvis Johnson, a legendary football coach at Harrodsburg High School and later served as an athletics administrator at Kentucky.\nJohnson is considered the No. 12 overall recruit in the nation and has been playing for Overtime Elite, based in Atlanta. Johnson will join Great Crossing standout Malachi Moreno, who committed to the Wildcats last month. Moreno is considered the top center in the Class of 2025.\nJasper's Johnson's parents, Dennis and Alethea Johnson, were excited that their son chose Kentucky. (Kentucky Today/Keith Taylor)\n“It's been a really good experience,” Johnson said. “It's been a long journey. I spent a lot of hours, you know, as a young kid, dreaming and hoping I get this opportunity Being able to be here in this moment right now is a blessing.”\nJohnson said he has always wanted to play for Kentucky “from a young age” and added staying close to home is the best decision\n\"I feel like it was the best decision for me to grow and develop as a student-athlete,” he said. “My parents went there. Being able to have this opportunity being from the city and being able to represent my city and state. I feel like this was the best decision for me.\"\nJay Bordas, an assistant coach at Bryan Station, began coaching Johnson in second grade through AAU and knew Johnson was an elite talent from the beginning.\n“I told everybody in third grade he would play a professional sport, and they thought I was crazy,” Bordas said. “He’s bred to be a professional — his dad (Dennis) and the Johnsons. I’m just really happy for him. I think he's going to have a great college and, professional career. He's a great kid from a great family.”\nBordas added that Johnson “does everything extremely well on the court” and his work ethic is unmatched.\nJasper Johnson hugs his father, Dennis, after choosing Kentucky.\n“He can shoot it, shoots extremely well, plays a high level and he's athletic, more athletic than people know,” Bordas said. “He's got a great work ethic, I mean, back, even back when he was a little, little guy, he'd get 20 points for me in AAU and Dennis was never satisfied.\n“They'd be back in the gym that night — early mornings, late nights, he stays in the gym. He’s just a great guy and his work ethic is unbelievable.”\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Keith Taylor Sports Editor\nAuthor email Follow Keith Taylor Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!
