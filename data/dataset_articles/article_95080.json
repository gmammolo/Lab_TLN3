  "text": "Generals hire NHL alumnus Brad Malone as Player Development Coach\nOshawa, Ont. – The Oshawa Generals are excited to announce Brad Malone as our new Player Development Coach.\nMalone brings a wealth of professional hockey experience to the role. Drafted by the Colorado Avalanche in 2007, Malone went on to play with the Carolina Hurricanes and the Edmonton Oilers before retiring at the end of the last season, wrapping up his final years with the Bakersfield Condors following the 2024 Calder Cup playoffs.\n“I’m thrilled to join the Oshawa Generals and become part of such a storied franchise. I look forward to contributing to the team’s success and working alongside a talented group of players and coaches,” says Malone.\nBorn in Chatham, New Brunswick, Malone began his hockey career at the age of 15 at Cushing Academy where he then advanced to the USHL, playing for the Sioux Falls Stampede, leading to his draft year with the Avalanche and the rest of his pro career.\n“It’s great to add Brad to our staff. Brad brings a lot of playing experience in the NHL and AHL combined with strong leadership qualities. Looking for him to pass that down through our ranks and ultimately make our players better,” says Generals’ GM and Vice President, Roger Hunt.\nWe are thrilled to welcome him to our team and look forward to the impact he will have on our players’ development.\nWelcome to GensNation, Brad!",
