  "text": "For the first time ever, the NFL heads to Brazil.\nAnd this historic international event features two of the NFL’s top young quarterbacks, who will square off in São Paulo on Friday night in Week 1 action.\nThat’s right, Jordan Love will lead the Green Bay Packers into Neo Quimica Arena against Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles on Friday night, with the Eagles being a 2.5-point favorite.\nIt’s TGIF, NFL style, as FrontPageBets takes a look at its top player props for the Packers vs. Eagles in Brazil.\nBest NFL Betting Sites For Week 1 Friday Night Player Props READ: Best NFL Betting Sites for Eagles vs. Packers People are also reading… Nebraska volleyball loses to unranked team for first time in over 6 years Sexyy Red delivers disappointingly short, but entertaining Lincoln show Malachi Coleman headed for redshirt season, Nebraska coach Matt Rhule says Nebraska high school football rankings, Sept. 2 One Lincoln winner is holding a $280,000 Nebraska Pick 5 ticket Man killed in UTV accident north of Lincoln Tank's Country bar brings love for Huskers, country music to Lincoln Railyard Man who died after falling out of UTV in Lancaster County identified One injured in shooting in downtown Lincoln late Thursday Recalled school board member called unqualified to serve on state library board 5-stars, flips and key 2026 targets: Nebraska football set for major recruiting weekend Colorado taking throwback approach to Nebraska rivalry; Deion Sanders weighs in on Dylan Raiola That photo of people wearing 'Nebraska Walz's for Trump' shirts? They're distant cousins Nebraska to revive balloon touchdown tradition for Colorado game 'This isn't going to shake our faith': Da'Nelle and Kurt Earl fight cancer battle with love, hope Best Packers vs. Eagles Player Props for Week 1: Jalen Hurts, Jordan Love props & more The Eagles enter the 2024 season still smarting from the way they finished last year. After starting 10-1, Philadelphia lost six of its last seven, including a Wild Card playoff loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Not the way the 2022 NFC champs wanted to go out.\nThe Packers, led by Love in his first season as the starter, beat the Dallas Cowboys in the Wild Card round last year only to fall to the NFC champion San Francisco 49ers in the Divisional round.\nHowever, it was a glimpse of things to come for the young Packers as they are favored just behind the Lions to win the NFC North this year.\nJalen Hurts props: Under 280.5 passing + rushing yards on Friday Night Football (-115 or better) Since bursting onto the scene in 2020, Hurts has led the Eagles with both his arm and his legs, racking up, including playoffs, 72 passing touchdowns and 46 rushing scores.\nThe dual-thread quarterback has been Philly’s go-to in short-yardage and goal-line situations, coining and perfecting the “Tush Push.”\nBut Hurts hurts defenses more in the short field than he does in wide-open spaces.\nHe averaged 262.1 combined yards per game in 2023, including the playoffs; and for his career, Hurts has a 232-yard-per-game passing + rushing average.\nEagles vs. Packers props: Jordan Love Under 253.5 passing yards (-115 or better) Love finished last season ranked seventh in the NFL in passing, racking up 4,159 regular-season passing yards.\nIncluding the playoffs, the Packers quarterback averaged just over 243 passing yards per game.\nHe only threw for 250 or more yards in eight of his 19 games last season, including only two games with 300 or more yards through the air.\nIn Week 1 last year, Love threw for 245 yards in a win over the Chicago Bears. But three of his passes went for touchdowns.\nPackers vs. Eagles anytime TD picks: Saquon Barkley (-105 or better) When healthy, Saquon Barkley is one of the best all-purpose backs in the NFL.\nAnd now that he’s got a new team, heading to the Eagles in the offseason from the NFC East rival New York Giants, Barkley has his health and a new offense to showcase his talents – one of which is finding the end zone.\nIn 76 career NFL games, including playoffs, Barkley has scored 49 times – 37 rushing and 12 receiving. His best season was his rookie year in 2018, when he rushed for 11 and caught four TDs.\nBarkley will take a lot of the rushing load off Hurts and provide the Eagles with another red-zone option, as well as a home run threat.\nLook for Barkley to find paydirt a lot this season, including Friday night in São Paulo.\nBest Packers vs. Eagles player props for Friday Night Football Week 1 Jalen Hurts props: Under 280.5 passing + rushing yards (-115 or better) Jordan Love props: Under 253.5 passing yards (-115 or better) Packers vs. Eagles anytime TD picks in Brazil: Saquon Barkley (-105 or better)",
