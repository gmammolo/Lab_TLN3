  "text": "ROSEMENT, Illinois — The Cleburne Railroaders opened up the 2024 postseason with a win on the road as they handled the Chicago Dogs in game one of the divisional series 6-3 on Wednesday night at Impact Field.\nEight of the nine runs scored came in the third inning as the Railroaders got on the board after a throwing error from second baseman Brantley Bell to the plate scored two runs. Right fielder Korey Holland followed with two more after a double, one of two on the night, and third baseman Bret Boswell capped off the five-run frame with an RBI-single.\nThe Dogs responded soon after when Bell made up for his mistake with a two-run blast to left field. Shortstop Derek Maiben drove in one later in the inning with a single to cut the deficit to two.\nThe only other run scored came in the top of the ninth when shortstop Shed Long hit a solo home run off Chicago closer, left-handed pitcher Joey Marciano, leaving Impact Field with not much hope left.\nOutside of that third inning, starting right-handed pitcher Johnathon Tripp was excellent for Cleburne. In five innings of work, Tripp allowed those three runs off six hits and struck out two. The bullpen continued the great work for Cleburne as right-handed pitchers Kristian Scott and Chris Muller each went one inning and only gave up two hits combined.\nRight-handed pitcher Dylan Bice finished the job with a two-inning save, his sixth of the season, striking out four out of the six batters he faced. A key matchup going into the series was Cleburne’s pitching against the American Association’s Player of the Year, first baseman Jacob Teter. In game one, Teter went 0-for-5 and struck out twice.\nThe Railroaders will try to close out the best-of-3 series on Friday night as they return to La Moderna Field for game two against the Dogs. Gates open at six with first pitch set for 7:06 p.m. Visit\nRailroaderbaseball.com for more information and tickets.",
