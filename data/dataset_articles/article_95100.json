Laura Wolvaardt and Marco Jansen walked away as the SA Women's and Men's Players of the Year at the Cricket South Africa (CSA) Awards held in Johannesburg on Thursday evening. Proteas women skipper Wolvaardt collected five awards on the night as she was crowned Women's T20 International Player of the Year, One-Day International Player of the Year, Players' Player of the Year and Fans' Player of the Year. Jansen was recognised for his all-round efforts in a season that saw the 24-year-old go from strength to strength as a key member of the ICC Men's World Cup 2023 squad and notable contributions in the Test arena. Elsewhere in the men's international categories, Western Province batter David Bedingham scooped the International Men's Newcomer of the Year and Test Player of the Year awards. Reeza Hendricks was named the Men's T20 International Player of the Year, Quinton de Kock received the Men's One-Day International Player of the Year award in his final 50-over season with the Proteas and Keshav Maharaj was voted by his peers as the Men's Players' Player of the Year. Eliz-Mari Marx earned herself the International Women's Newcomer of the Year. The Best Delivery Fuelled by KFC was courtesy of a wonderfully pitched-up in-swinger from Marizanne Kapp that forced Australia's Beth Mooney to play down the wrong line, with the ball expertly disturbing her stumps. The Makhaya Ntini Power of Cricket Award seeks to demonstrate the ability of this game to change lives and communities. Proteas Women's seamer Masabata Klaas is a person who has lived a changed life through cricket. The 33-year-old has played the bulk of her storied international career as a mother to Rethabile, with the power of womanhood allowing her to work and return to cricket. Klaas missed at least three years of cricket but returned to become not just a revered member of the Proteas Women's team but a mentor to younger players. Lions spinner Nqaba Peter was named both the Men's Domestic Newcomer Player of the Season and T20 Challenge Player of the Season. His Lions team-mate and all-rounder Wiaan Mulder was awarded the 4-Day Domestic Player of the Season, and Western Province all-rounder Mihlali Mpongwana was the One-Day Cup Player of the Season. The following players were honoured in the inaugural women's Division 1 categories: Garden Route Badgers batters Tabitha La Grange (Women's Domestic Newcomer of the Season) and Tazmin Brits (Women's T20 Player of the Season), along with Dolphins spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba (Women's One-Day Player of the Season). Lions spinner Bjorn Fortuin and Free State all-rounder Yolandi Potgieter were the evening's double winners after receiving the Men's and Women's SACA Most Valuable Player (MVP) and Domestic Players' Player of the Year in their respective categories. Russell Domingo of the Lions was named the Men's Division 1 Coach of the Year, and JP Triegaardt of the Knights the Men's Division 2 Coach of the Year, while the Women's Division 1 Coach of the Year award went to Western Province's Claire Terblanche. In the operational category, Allahudien Palekar was recognised as the CSA Umpire of the Year and the CSA Umpires' Umpire of the Year. \"I would like to congratulate every single one of our winners for the excellence they displayed over the past 12 months,\" CSA CEO Pholetsi Moseki said at the awards. \"It has been a promising year all round for South African cricket, and proof of that is in results as well as the growth of the game. \"Laura and Marco are the winners of our premier awards and they have worked hard to achieve this recognition. We saw Laura elevated to captain of the Proteas Women, a responsibility she has thrived on. \"Marco too has enjoyed a phenomenal season, which culminated with his role as the Proteas Men enjoyed a strong campaign at the 50-over World Cup in India. \"On the domestic front, we are continuing to see talent blossom and congratulations to all the winners in that category as well. Let us not forget to acknowledge our umpires, grounds staff and scorers, too,\" he added.",
