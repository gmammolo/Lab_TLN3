  "text": "Ronaldo becomes 1st man to score 900 career goals Cristiano Ronaldo isn't showing any signs of slowing down. The 39-year-old recorded the 900th goal of his professional career Thursday, scoring against Croatia in Portugal's opening game of the 2024-25 Nations League. Ronaldo reached the milestone by scoring from close range in the first half of Portugal's eventual 2-1 win. Ronaldo appeared emotional after scoring, briefly celebrating and then putting his hands over his face and falling to the ground before being surrounded by teammates. The goal comes days after Ronaldo's inclusion in Portugal's squad raised eyebrows following his poor performance at Euro 2024. Asked about possibly retiring from the national team, Ronaldo [said](https://thescore.com/news/3066346) the thought \"never\" crossed his mind after the summer tournament. He now has 131 goals in 213 appearances for Portugal. His 769 club goals are split between Real Madrid (450), Manchester United (145), Juventus (101), current team Al-Nassr (68), and Sporting CP (5).
