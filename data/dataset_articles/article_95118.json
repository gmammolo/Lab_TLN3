  "text": "2025 5-star guard Jasper Johnson commits to Kentucky Top-15 recruit Jasper Johnson committed to attend Kentucky and play for Mark Pope next season, he announced Thursday. Jasper is the No. 13 prospect and fourth-highest-ranked point guard on the [2025 ESPN 100](https://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/playerrankings). A native of Lexington, Johnson chose the Wildcats over Arkansas, Alabama, Louisville, and North Carolina. Johnson's father, Dennis, was an all-SEC defensive end at Kentucky before playing three seasons in the NFL. \"Being from Lexington, Kentucky, I feel like that was an easy decision right there,\" Johnson said to a crowd after committing, according to [Sam Lance of Zagsblog.com.](https://www.zagsblog.com/2024/09/05/five-star-guard-jasper-johnson-stays-home-commits-to-mark-pope-and-kentucky/) \"I feel like I'm KY 'til I die. \"There's a lot of pride on the line with the name on the front of the jersey,\" Johnson added. \"I'm really excited about my decision, and I'm ready to get started and represent Kentucky.\" The 6-foot-4 point guard, who will spend his senior year of high school playing at Overtime Elite, joins big man Malachi Moreno as the second high-end prospect from the 2025 class to commit to Kentucky in the past few weeks.",
