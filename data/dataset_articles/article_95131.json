  "text": "The UFC 306 broadcast team is set for the historic event at the Sphere in Las Vegas with plans to celebrate Mexican Independence Day throughout the night.\nAfter missing out on UFC 305 in Australia because he doesn’t travel to international cards, Joe Rogan returns to serve as color commentator alongside UFC Hall of Famer Daniel Cormier . Like usual, Jon Anik handles play-by-play duties for the event.\nIn the arena, Megan Olivi handles reporting with Din Thomas serving as the sideline coach throughout the broadcast on ESPN’s networks including the ESPN+ pay-per-view.\nUFC officials confirmed the broadcast plans to MMA Fighting on Thursday.\nWhile the broadcast team is largely the same for every major pay-per-view event, this card isn’t the typical UFC show with elaborate plans for production built around the card as the Sphere.\nWith massive LED screens surrounding the circular arena, the UFC production team in coordination with ESPN plans to roll out a much different look for the pay-per-view that kicks off next Saturday night from Las Vegas.\nThe fights on the card will also feature different backgrounds throughout the show with the LED screens being utilized even when the action is taking place inside the octagon.\nUFC CEO Dana White revealed recently that the promotion has invested more than $20 million for the event, which is an unprecedented investment for a single pay-per-view. It’s likely this is the first and only card that the UFC will produce at the Sphere with the company still maintaining a relationship with MGM, who owns and operates the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\nUFC 306 is headlined by a pair of title fights as Sean O’Malley defends his bantamweight championship against Merab Dvalishvili while Alexa Grasso faces off with Valentina Shevchenko with the flyweight title on the line in the co-main event.\n🥷🥊🥋 😍 USE the BET9JA Promotion Code YOHAIG for a ₦100,000 Bonus!",
