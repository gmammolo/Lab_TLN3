  "text": "HONOLULU (Island News) -- Hawaii is paying the Los Angeles Clippers $750,000 as part of a partnership that would bring the basketball team to the Islands for training camp and a preseason game in Honolulu against the Golden State Warriors in October. Public records show that the Hawaii Tourism Authority (HTA) will receive several marketing opportunities both during the Clippers time in Hawaii, as well as in Los Angeles, most notably being given the designation of Official Partner of the L.A. Clippers. The contract also says the Clippers are scheduled to do several community events in Hawaii during their training camp, which includes youth basketball clinics, school computer lab renovations and VIP meet and greets with players or staff. HTA says it has a pre-existing relationship with the Clippers dating back to the 2019 training camp. Due to NBA geographic market restrictions, only the Clippers and L.A. Lakers could host training camps in Hawaii. The Lakers said they were not available to play preseason games in Hawaii this year. The Clippers are scheduled to hold training camp in Honolulu from Oct. 1-5, with a game scheduled against the Warriors, who are also scheduled to be practicing the same week but at BYU-Hawaii on Oahu’s North Shore.",
