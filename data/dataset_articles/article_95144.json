  "text": "Curtis McGrath begins his gold medal defence as Australia’s top athletes compete in Para Canoe, Para Swimming, and more on Day 9 of Paris 2024.\nDay 9 Highlights: Paris 2024 Paralympic Games\nAustralia’s Paralympic team co-captain, Curtis McGrath, is set to kick off his campaign to defend his double gold medals on Day 9 of the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, which will be broadcast live and free on the 9Network and 9Now. McGrath will compete in the heats of the Para Canoe event, marking the beginning of his quest for victory.\nThe aquatic centre will also be busy, with Rachael Watson aiming for her third consecutive 50m freestyle gold, while Tom Gallagher seeks his second gold medal of the Games. They’ll be joined by ten other Australians in the Para Swimming competition.\nIn Para Athletics, freshly crowned 400m T36 gold medallist James Turner will now switch his focus to the 100m event.\nMeanwhile, Australia’s Para Cycling team will take to the road once again after securing four medals in the time trials. The Road Race event will be broadcast live from 5.30pm AEST on 9GemHD, with Meg Lemon, Alana Forster, and Alistair Donohue eager to improve on their silver-medal performances in the Time Trial.\nThe Paris 2024 Paralympic Games will continue to be broadcast live on Channel 9HD and 9GemHD, with every moment streamed on 9Now. Audiences can also catch Daily Highlights, Top 10 Moments, and tailored coverage focusing on Team Australia, Para Swimming, and Para Athletics.\nAthlete in Focus: Telaya Blacksmith – Women’s Long Jump T20 Final\nTelaya Blacksmith has her sights set on achieving big things in Paris 2024. A Walpiri woman originally from Lajamanu, Northern Territory, she now resides in Sydney, where she is honing her skills as a runner and footballer. Blacksmith is also a promising talent in the Sydney Swans AFL Academy.\nSelected for her first Paralympics, Blacksmith holds Australian age records in the 100m, 200m, and long jump events, though she primarily competes in the 400m at the international level. Inspired by legendary Australian sprinter Cathy Freeman, Blacksmith is ready to leave her mark in the Long Jump T20 Final.\nBlacksmith’s intellectual disability qualifies her for Paralympic competition under criteria for significant limitations in adaptive behaviour. Describing herself, she says: “A fast, friendly girl from the NT ready to show the world what I’ve got. I represent my family every time I race and know that I am an inspiration for other young Aboriginal kids.”\nDAY 9 SCHEDULE HIGHLIGHTS\nFriday, September 6\nAll times in AEST\n5.30 PM – PARA CYCLING ROAD RACE\nCompetitors: Emily Petricola, Meg Lemon, Alana Forster (Women’s C4-5)\nAlistair Donohue, Korey Boddington (Men’s C4-5)\n5.30 PM – PARA SWIMMING (HEATS)\nTom Gallagher (Men’s 100m Backstroke S10)\nJasmine Greenwood (Women’s 100m Backstroke S10)\nBrenden Hall, Tim Hodge, Lewis Bishop (Men’s 100m Butterfly S9)\nBen Hance, Ricky Betar (Men’s 100m Backstroke S14)\nMaddie McTernan (Women’s 100m Backstroke S14)\nAhmed Kelly (Men’s 50m Freestyle S4)\nRachael Watson (Women’s 50m Freestyle S4)\nCallum Simpson (Men’s 100m Freestyle S8)\n6.00 PM – PARA ATHLETICS\nAnnabelle Colman (Women’s 1500m T20)\nSam McIntosh (Men’s 100m T52 Final)\nGuy Henly (Men’s Discus Throw F37 Final)\nRheed McCracken (Men’s 800m T34 Final)\nFrom 6.00 PM – PARA CANOE HEATS\nCurtis McGrath (Kayak Single 200m KL2 and VL3)\nSusan Seipel (Va-a Single 200m VL2, Kayak 200m KL2)\nDylan Littlehales (Kayak Single 200m KL3)\nSaturday, September 7\n1.30 AM – PARA SWIMMING (FINALS)\n3.00 AM – PARA ATHLETICS\nTelaya Blacksmith (Women’s Long Jump T20 Final)\nSamantha Schmidt, Ella Hose (Women’s Discus Throw F38)\nJames Turner (Men’s 100m T36)\nRhiannon Clarke (Women’s 400m T38)\nSchedules subject to change.",
