  "text": "USC Football News: Caleb Williams Ready for NFL Debut with Bears: 'It's All About the Win'\nCaleb Williams is set to make his highly anticipated NFL debut as the Chicago Bears face off against the Tennessee Titans on September 8.\nThe former USC quarterback enters the 2024 season with significant expectations after being selected as the No. 1 overall pick in this year's\nNFL Draft.\nWilliams is focused on team success rather than individual statistics. He understands that winning is the priority, regardless of personal performance metrics.\n“As long as we get a win,” Williams said. “Because last time I remembered, the wins are the most important thing. And so as long as we get that win, at the end of the day, 100 yards, 400, it all becomes the same.\"\nAs the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner, Williams has the chance to become the first No. 1 overall pick to win a Week 1 start since David Carr did so with the\nHouston Texans in 2002.\nHistorically, rookie quarterbacks have struggled in their first games, with no wins in the last five seasons. The last rookie to secure a victory in a Week 1 start was Sam Darnold, another USC product, in 2018.\nThe Bears have named Williams a team captain, a role he takes seriously. \"I'm extremely grateful,” Williams said. “I can't really think of how many rookies are captains, especially with a team so talented like this.\n\"We're a pretty young team but we obviously have a good amount of vets on this team, so to be named a captain by my peers and colleagues, my teammates and my friends and brothers I'm extremely grateful, extremely happy and something I told them as soon as I got to be able to break it down or talk to them and things like that, so. You know, ready to go. Fired up. Extremely grateful and we're excited.\"\nHis teammates have expressed strong confidence in his abilities as they prepare for the season opener.\n\"The expectation is what it always is: winning,\" said receiver\nKeenan Allen. \"No matter who the quarterback is, you want to win. I wouldn’t rather be with another guy right now than Caleb. He’s gotten better ever since we started. The confidence is through the roof.\"\n“He went out there and proved himself, took command of the offense,” said Bears receiver DJ Moore. “He started opening up. People saw that and we’re rocking with him.”\nWilliams showcased his talent during the preseason, drawing attention through his performances, which were featured in the HBO series “Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Chicago Bears.”\nHe is currently favored to win the Offensive Rookie of the Year award, a title last claimed by a USC player in 1982.\nThe Bears have long sought a standout quarterback, and Williams has the potential to break franchise records, including the elusive 4,000-yard passing season. With a talented offensive roster around him, expectations are high as he steps into this pivotal role.\nAs the season kicks off, Williams' teammates are eager to see him lead the team to victory.\n“I just want him to go out there and play football for real,” Moore said. “Do what he’s been doing. He’s a winner, so lead us to a win.\"",
