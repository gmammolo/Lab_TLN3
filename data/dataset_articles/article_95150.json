  "text": "TAMPA — Are the Bucs ready for some football? Head Coach Todd Bowles is.\nWhat You Need To Know Sunday marks the beginning of a quest for a fourth straight NFC South Division title for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\nFor the most part, Tampa Bay is keeping the band together from last year’s playoff team\nThe Bucs open at home against the Washington Commanders\nKickoff Sunday is at 4:25 p.m. \"It's exciting!\" the normally stoic Bowles shouted Wednesday at his weekly news conference ahead of Sunday's opener against the Washington Commanders.\nA seemingly drama-free and productive preseason indicates this team is ready as Tampa Bay kicks off the season with all the expectations that come with it.\n\"You always have the butterflies when you go out there,\" Bowles said. \"I mean, it’s opening day in the NFL.\"\nSunday marks the beginning of a quest for a fourth consecutive NFC South Division title.\n\"You prep all year, all offseason, it just feels like the waiting game forever,\" said quarterback Baker Mayfield. \"And you finally get to the game prep and game planning and all that stuff, it is exciting.\"\nFor the most part, Tampa Bay is keeping the band together from last year’s playoff team. Mayfield will once again lead the offense with his usual weapons, Mike Evans and Chris Godwin.\nBut there are some significant additions that could lead Tampa Bay to bigger things than just a division title. An amped up offensive line and an emphasis on the running game, coupled with a physical and fast defense and injection of youth, could make for a long playoff run.\n\"Expectations are to get wins,\" Bowles said of his quarterback. \"Whether it’s running the ball or throwing the ball, if he can take care of the football and understand the offense and get it where it needs to be, those are my expectations.\"\nFor the first time in franchise history, the Bucs can punch their ticket to a fifth straight postseason. Once a team that spent more than a decade watching the postseason from afar, they are now in a position to be a perennial playoff team and a legit contender.\n\"This is the closest group I’ve ever been a part of,\" Mayfield said. \"And that goes back to college days, too. That’s pretty special and extremely rare, to be honest with you. We have the group that’s not going to take it for granted.\n\"You can’t just expect everyone to go out there and roll over on people. You’ve got to be able to go out and execute, and we’ve got the group that’s that focused.\nKickoff Sunday is at 4:25 p.m. at Raymond James Stadium.",
