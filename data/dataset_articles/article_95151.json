  "text": "MANILA, Philippines – The victory couldn’t be any more pulsating for San Miguel Beer.\nJust when Rain or Shine looked poised to keep its unbeaten run going, June Mar Fajardo came to the Beermen’s rescue with a buzzer-beating game-winner for a 113-112 escape in the PBA Governors’ Cup on Thursday, September 5, at the Ninoy Aquino Stadium.\nThe Beermen — with no timeouts left and still down one with just 3 seconds remaining — capped a wild endgame where Fajardo caught a long inbound pass from CJ Perez before launching a jumper from the elbow that saw the ball bounce on the front rim before going in as time expired\n“I had to shoot it. It was the dying seconds already, we needed to get the win,” the soft-spoken Cebuano center said in Filipino after the game.\nBefore the thrilling Fajardo winner, San Miguel’s defensive stalwart Chris Ross had a costly foul on Rain or Shine rookie Felix Lemetti, who was attempting a four-point shot.\nLemetti, who has already shown his clutch gene through his first five PBA games, nailed all four to give Rain or Shine a 112-111 edge with 3 seconds left.\nFajardo finished the game with 27 points, 23 coming in the second half, and grabbed 21 rebounds on a historic night where he surpassed 1980 PBA MVP Philip Cezar (5,835) for the seventh spot in the all-time career rebounding list.\nThe eight-time PBA Most Valuable Player also tied former San Miguel great Danny Siegle in the 10th spot for most free throws made in a career with 2,396, going 5-of-8 in the charity stripe.\nFTW!
