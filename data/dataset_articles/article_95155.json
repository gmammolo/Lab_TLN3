  "text": "Sep. 4—Brandon Lyons, a handcyclist from Mechanicsburg, made his Paralympic debut Wednesday, finishing 10th in the men's H3 individual time trials in the Paris suburbs. Lyons covered the two laps of the 14.1-kilometer course in 49 minutes, 34.02 seconds, a little more than six minutes off the pace set by France's Mathieu Bosredon, who won gold at 43:33.22. France's Johan Quaile took second place (45:33.41) while Martino Pini of Italy claimed bronze (46:13.69). Lyons, who graduated from Cumberland Valley High School and Penn State University, suffered a spinal injury in May 2014 and took up handcycling to remain active after his injury. In 2017, he participated in a full-time residency program at the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and developed sepsis just before the Team USA qualifying event for the Tokyo Games in 2021. Lyons' maiden voyage through the Paralympics is set to continue with the men's H3 road race scheduled for Thursday morning. Tim Gross is the sports editor at The Sentinel and cumberlink.com .
