  "text": "Yes, we get it. Shedeur Sanders has all the eyes on him right now. And honestly, that guy deserves it. He managed to lock in around 4 touchdowns and 1 interception. Not only that, he ran for 445 yards. That is a major thing. This was the same dude who was marked as the “most sacked QB” last season and also as “overrated” by many analysts or media outlets. This time around, after the amazing season opener win against the Bisons, Shedeur has managed to make this season the year of redemption for Deion Sanders and the Buffs. However, don’t y’all think we are missing someone here? We have said it before and we will say it again. Coach Prime’s ex-wife Pilar Sanders deserves the “Mother of the Year” award. Cause when no one was talking about how good Shilo Sanders performed, she made sure on September 6th that people knew how the younger brother managed to do against NDSU. Pilar took to her Instagram to share stats of Shilo during the NDSU game. The dude has managed to pull in 9 solid tackles throughout the game. Not only that, he achieved a defensive grade of 71.8. “CONGRATULATIONS SON!!!! 🗣️ Go #shilosanders,” Pilar wrote on her Instagram. Back in July [https://www.essentiallysports.com/nfl-ncaa-news-who-wrote-that-shilo-sanders-shuts-down-shoulder-injury-rumors-setting-the-record-straight-ahead-of-twenty-twenty-four-season/], when Shilo said, “We definitely have a better chance of winning this year than last year.” He was not joking around. The season opener gave us a really good idea of how the Buffs would go about with this year’s run. Yes, we will admit that the offense could’ve been better, but you’d be lying to yourself if you said Shilo, Shedeur, Travis Hunter, and Jimmy Horn Jr. are not in their best shape this season. While Pilar couldn’t have been happier with what Shilo had managed to achieve. His older brother, Deion Sanders Jr, was not cool with the way Shilo had played during the season opener. Not only that, the fans were also not happy with what Shilo had showcased during the game. However, what could’ve led to this flood of hate directed toward the young CU Buffs’ safety? SHILO SANDERS PLAYED IT “DIRTY” Not once, not twice, but 3 times Shilo’s plays on the field were found questionable. There were 2 instances when he pushed a Bison player into the stadium wall after going out of bounds. Shilo also, for some wild reason, decided to land a late hit on a receiver who had zero defenses around him. This resulted in a penalty for the Bisons and also a set of downs. This also gave Bisons QB Cam Miller the opportunity and score a TD during that drive. Fans called out Shilo as “the dirtiest player in college football”. Deion Jr. was quick to point out that Shilo’s game almost risked the Buffs the season opener win. “Stupid a– penalties, Shilo was playing like a crash dummy at times,” Deion Jr. had noted during a conversation on the Zero 2 Sixty podcast. Bucky aka Deion Jr. and his anger was pretty much justified. Last year as well, we saw the same thing from Shilo causing useless penalties during the third down. While the dude has a lot of potential, he has to work on his overall game ethic. Regardless, let’s hope during the game against the Cornhuskers, he puts on his good-boy pants.",
