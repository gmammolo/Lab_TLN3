  "title": "Custom motorcycle design shows some love for the Detroit Lions",
  "text": "Detroit Lions fans often show off their pride with hats or t-shirts with the team logo, but there’s one motorcycle that’s taking things to another level. It’s a custom motorcycle with a design that celebrates the Lions. The motorcycle came to life during season four of “Call Sam Chopper Shop,” which was created by the Sam Bernstein Law Firm and is co-hosted by former Detroit Red Wing and four-time Stanley Cup champion Darren McCarty. The custom work on the motorcycle was carried out at Bag Pig Customs. The bike is customized with a football-themed seat, Lions foot pegs, and when you step on the brakes, there’s even a Lion on the back that lights up, McCarty explained. “This is not only just for the motorcycle enthusiast,” McCarty said. “This is for the sports collector, the Lions fan, somebody like this.” The custom bike is being raffled off to a lucky winner, and raffle ticket sales will go toward supporting veterans. The raffle drawing will happen on Oct. 27, which is when it will be narrowed down to three finalists. Those finalists will then be invited to the Lions game on Nov. 17, where one lucky winner will be selected. [Click here to learn more about the raffle](https://callsam.com/chopper-shop/) and to enter for a chance to win the one-of-a-kind motorcycle. You can watch the video above to get a glimpse of the motorcycle and to see some of the work that went into creating the custom bike.",
