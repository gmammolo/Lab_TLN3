ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Alex Morgan’s club career is an equally iconic one. Alex has played with several NWSL teams including the San Diego Wave, Portland Thorns, and Orlando Pride, and in Europe with Lyon and Tottenham. With over 90 goals in 212 appearances and six trophies to her name, her impact on the field is ineffable. As Alex herself reflects, “I learned so much about myself in that time and so much of that is a credit to my teammates and our fans. I feel immense pride in where this team is headed, and I will forever be a fan of the USWNT.” Alex also went on to add, “My desire for success may have always driven me, but what I got in return was more than I could have ever asked and hoped for.” The world is saying goodbye to more than a player; they’re saying farewell to an icon, a trailblazer, and a beloved figure who changed the game forever. As she steps away from the limelight, her name will echo across generations to come.",
