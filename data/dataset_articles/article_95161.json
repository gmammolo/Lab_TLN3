  "text": "[ Sports ](https://www.stripes.com/sports/) Army’s Marks collects fourth Paralympic silver medal in 4x50 medley relay Stars and Stripes September 5, 2024 NANTERRE, France — Army Sgt. 1st Class Elizabeth Marks barely has time to catch her breath these days. The 34-year-old member of the Army’s World Class Athlete Program has swum 12 races in six events over the first eight days of the 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris. The latest came Thursday evening at La Defense Arena with the mixed 4x50-meter medley relay, where she and teammates Morgan Ray, Abbas Karimi and Leanne Smith picked up the silver medal. Instead of being exhausted, however, Marks finds the hectic schedule comforting. “I think it’s good to stay busy, especially in this environment, where you have a lot of events spread out over 10 days,” Marks said. “You can’t control where they fall, so staying in the water, racing helps me a lot.” Not only is Marks racing, but she’s also picking up a massive medal haul. The Prescott Valley, Ariz., native collected her fourth silver of the Games on Thursday. The previous three came in the women’s 50 freestyle S2, women’s 200 individual medley SM6 and mixed 4x50 freestyle relay. The U.S. quartet set a new Americas mark with their time of 2 minutes, 31.01 seconds. They were bested only by a world-record performance from China at 2:24.83. “I think hitting the podium, no matter what it is, is an honor,” Marks said of the second-place finishes. Being happy is something the team stresses, and Marks couldn’t have been happier swimming first. She mentioned how being on a relay gives her anxiety because she doesn’t want to let her teammates down. After swimming the anchor leg in the 4x50 freestyle relay, she got to hit the pool first because her best stroke, the backstroke, was the opening leg. Marks completed her 50-meter swim in 38.52 seconds, which had the Americans in fifth. A strong breaststroke from Ray put the Americans in front for the better part of two legs, before China’s Guo Jincheng erased what was a nearly three-second deficit and turned it into a nearly seven-second victory. Marks had raced with Karimi and Smith before, but not with Ray. She praised his performance and said overall it was a great time. “I really enjoy the process,” Marks said. “That’s a very fun crew, and our motto is to have fun. “Being the leadoff leg was a lot of fun. It was a lot more fun starting it off than being the anchor.” Marks’ full schedule isn’t over. Up next for the nine-time Paralympic medalist is her best event: the women’s 100 backstroke S6. Marks is the world recordholder and [defending Paralympic champion](https://www.stripes.com/sports/2024-08-27/elizabeth-marks-paralympics-swimming-preview-14989349.html). That event is Saturday. Another athlete with military ties who’s had a busy timetable is Taylor Winnett. The wife of Army Spc. Jeric Winnett advanced to her second final in as many tries Thursday in the women’s 400 freestyle S10. The Hersey, Pa., native wasn’t pleased with her time of 4:55.29, which placed her eighth in the final. She faded down the stretch after sitting in seventh through the first 300 meters. Instead of harping on the negatives, she said it continues her growth during her Paralympics debut. “I usually try to come back really hard, but my body was tired,” Winnett said. “I tried to go out a little more aggressive than I usually do, and I think I paid for it. “But you learn more every race you do.” She has two more finals to go — the women’s 100 backstroke S10 on Friday, and the women’s 100 individual medley SM10 on Saturday. Elsewhere during the Paris Paralympics: • Marine veteran Jataya Taylor and the U.S. women’s foil team lost their quarterfinal matchup in wheelchair fencing with eventual bronze-medalist Italy 45-16. The 38-year-old gave the early advantage with a four-point victory over Ionela Andreea Mogos, and she followed that up with a 7-5 win over Loredana Trigilia. Taylor dropped her last match to Beatrice Maria Vio Grandis 5-0. • A pair of Army sharpshooters, Sgt. 1st Class John Joss III and Staff Sgt. Kevin Nguyen, finished right next to each other in the mixed 10-meter air rifle prone SH1 event. During qualification, Joss III totaled 619.2 points to finish 14th. Nguyen, meanwhile, amassed 618.6 points to place 15th. Only the top eight qualified for the final. • Marine veteran Jorge Salazar and the U.S. men’s wheelchair basketball team defeated Canada 80-43 in the semifinals on Thursday night at Bercy Arena.",
