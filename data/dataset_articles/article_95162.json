  "text": "Montana State quarterback Tommy Mellott stood at the Bobcats’ 32-yard line on third-and-10 trailing New Mexico 31-28 with 1 minute, 29 seconds to play.\nTo Mellott’s left was wide receiver Lonyatta Alexander Jr., who slipped past Lobos defenders on a corner route. UNM cornerback Noah Avinger kept his eyes on Mellott, while fellow CB Ishmael Az-Zahir fell down as Alexander ran by. The busted coverage gave Alexander space just past the UNM 45 for the 37-yard completion.\nAlexander made another 5-yard catch near the sideline a few plays later, finishing his first game as a Bobcat with five catches for 58 yards.\n“God, he has his timing for everybody, and I felt like he put me in that time for a reason,” Alexander said Monday. “I had to show up and show out not just for me, but for my family and my teammates as well.”\nTaking advantage of every opportunity — and prioritizing winning over personal accolades — is the mantra for the MSU wide receivers room, position coach Justin Udy said.\n“That was what I was most proud of and saw (in the UNM game) was, hey, we needed Junior to make a couple of plays down the stretch and he was able to do that,” Udy added.\nFellow receiver Ty McCullouch was proud to see his teammate finally back on the field. Alexander — a two-time transfer — missed all of last season after being denied a waiver by the NCAA.\n“It’s great to see him out there, because with his whole eligibility thing, it made me smile to see him make plays out there,” McCullouch said on Aug. 26.\nPlaying a down for the Bobcats seemed like it would never come to fruition for Alexander. That’s what made that final drive even sweeter, and it’s why Alexander feels blessed to finally make plays for the Bobcats on Saturdays.\n“(The UNM game) felt like I was back to my old self playing on a consistent basis, making plays in the air, blocking for my running backs, for my quarterback and just having fun out there,” Alexander said.\nBozeman is Alexander’s third stop on his college football journey. The Auburn, Washington, native started out at Arizona State in 2021 before transferring to Washington in 2022. He transferred again ahead of the 2023 season, picking MSU because he meshed well with the team and wanted to help the Bobcats win a national title, Alexander told 406mtsports.com in January 2023 .\nAlexander, who still had three years of eligibility remaining, brought that excitement into his first fall camp in 2023. He loved how Udy kept the receivers level-headed and enjoyed working with Mellott and Sean Chambers as quarterbacks.\nEntering the 2023 season, Alexander was listed atop the MSU two-deep at the H/slot position. But he didn’t play in the Gold Rush game against Utah Tech as the Bobcats waited to hear back from the NCAA regarding his eligibility. MSU finally got confirmation ahead of the Weber State game in Week 4 that Alexander would have to sit out the entire season.\nVigen said on Sept. 18, 2023, that both sides knew this was a possibility going in and noted how challenging it was for Alexander to keep seeing a potential return date pushed back.\n“I think the good thing for Junior is he is in a place where he’s thriving,” Vigen said. “He’s thriving on the football field, but he’s also thriving in school and I think he feels like he’s in a really good place as far as having people surrounding him that are looking out for him and caring for him.”\nGoing into that season, Alexander felt he was playing a significant role in the offense. That made the ensuing weeks of waiting even more stressful. The finality of not being able to play in 2023 was devastating, he said.\n“But I tried to stay positive even on the days that I didn’t want to come here,” Alexander added. “There were days where it was very hard and days where I woke up and I just was like, ‘Do I really want to continue to do this?’”\nAt times, he wanted to quit football, drop out of school and find a 9 to 5 job. His parents helped him through his lowest moments, Alexander said, with his father reminding him of his aspirations.\n“My dream is to play in the NFL, and he kept bringing it up. I was just like, ‘You’re right, Pops,” Alexander said. “So just having him in my corner and going to bat for me every single day, whether I’m home or I’m away for college, it’s awesome.”\nIn Bozeman, Udy would regularly pull Alexander in his office for weekly check-ins to see where Alexander’s head was at with school and his new role as a practice-only player. Alexander also visited with counselor John Shirkey, who works with other MSU coaches and players. That included former Bobcat Devin Davis , who missed the entire 2022 season due to injury.\nUdy said he reminded Alexander there was plenty of time left in his MSU career and to see “the bigger picture.”\n“Being able to focus on his education, continue to develop himself as a football player, develop relationships with teammates and still create lasting memories through his time here, I think, is kind of what helped push him through,” Udy said. “And then the carrot at the end is the opportunity to come back and play and have a really good team around him and a great quarterback to throw to him.”\nAlexander looked forward to helping out the Bobcats on the scout team alongside younger WRs like Garret Walchli, Tom Carter and Javonte King. He enjoyed preparing the defense each week, especially for bigger games like the Week 2 matchup at South Dakota State.\nHe was also roommates with Mellott, WR Aidan Garrigan and then-defensive lineman Sebastian Valdez last year. He “loved every bit” of living with them that year and still considers Garrigan and Mellott role models. Alexander also found mentors in veteran WRs Clevan Thomas Jr. and McCullouch.\n“It was really the coaches and my teammates that really kept me going and kept me positive throughout that process,” Alexander said. “And what do you know, I’m still here in 2024 playing with the same guys, and now we’re smooth like butter.”\nAlexander changed his number from 7 to 2 — a number he’d mostly worn since the second grade — and felt the momentum building for 2024. He faced a slight setback with a low ankle sprain during spring ball, but he was proud to fight through that adversity.\nHe even provided one of the highlights of the 2024 Sonny Holland Classic with a contested 26-yard catch over defensive back Andrew Powdrell. Alexander said MSU’s DBs — such as Jon Johnson, Simeon Woodard and Powdrell — make him better every day. Johnson shared that sentiment during fall camp, adding that the WRs help him be more aggressive in press coverage.\n“We go at it. It gets physical. We talk crap to each other,” Alexander said. “But at the end of the day, it’s all love.\n“And Powdrell is one of those guys where he’s pretty physical, and I think I was just able to get the upper hand on him and make a play on the ball and get that first down.”\nUdy added that the offseason training program devised by strength and conditioning coach Sean Herrin was pivotal in Alexander’s “transition to becoming an elite receiver.” Alexander was noticeably stronger and more explosive, Udy said.\nThrough two games in 2024, Alexander ranks third on the team with six catches for 62 yards. Vigen said Monday that he expects Alexander to be called upon to be a playmaker in every game this season.\n“I’m really excited for him after missing out the previous year,” Vigen added. “He’s in year four now, and he’s had a rocky road to this point with time spent at three programs. I think he’s found a home, and I think he really appreciates being part of our program and wants to make an impact.”\nAlexander echoed that sentiment, and is excited for his first run out at Bobcat Stadium during Gold Rush this weekend. He said it hurt not being able to participate last year, but was awed by the sea of gold around him.\n“It’s awesome to see our community, our state, come together and watch the hometown kids and the kids that are coming from out of state, and play our hearts out for them,” Alexander said.\nOver the past year, Udy said he’s seen Alexander mature on and off the field, becoming a “glass half full guy.”\n“I’ve had people come up to me and say that they’ve met Junior, and he’s just one of those personalities that will always put a smile on your face,” Udy added.\nFor Alexander, he’s become even more grateful for his relationships, especially with family. He has relied on regular phone calls with his parents and his siblings, including his brother, Xe’ree Alexander, a former Idaho linebacker now at Central Florida.\nHe’s also grateful, after waiting a year longer than expected, to finally be playing the game he loves with a team he trusts deeply.\n“One thing I’ve learned is to enjoy being in the moment now,” Alexander said. “Instead of worrying about things in the past or what’s going to happen in the future, enjoy the moment now and have fun.”\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters Braden Shaw can be reached at or 406-582-2690.
