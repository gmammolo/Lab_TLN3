  "text": "Former Thunder Andre Roberson to continue his basketball career\nSources said former\nNBA swingman Andre Roberson will resume his professional basketball career with Cholet Basket of LNB Pro A on Thursday.\nRoberson, 32, was drafted No. 26 overall in the 2013 NBA Draft by the\nMinnesota Timberwolves before a trade sent him to the Oklahoma City Thunder. The wing played seven seasons with OKC and the Brooklyn Nets.\nRoberson is ready to go again\nWith the regular season set to tip off on September 27, the French club brings on the 32-year-old to replace the recently injured Aaron Wheeler. The team struck a .500 season in 2023 and finished seventh in the LNB Pro A standings. Now onboarding the former NBA defensive star, Cholet looks to make a push after the ongoing exhibition games.\n\"To replace Aaron, during his unavailability, we have bet on Andre Roberson, who will bring us his experience at the very highest level, his leadership, and his defensive qualities,\" says Cholet head coach Fabrice Lefrancois. \"Andre is also a facilitator in the game. A few weeks ago, he participated in the TBT tournament (a $1 million tournament) against several players playing or having played in Pro A, such as Rob Gray, Tashawn Thomas, etc. Consequently, he is physically ready to play.\" (h/t\nEuroHoops.net)\nIn the NBA, Roberson was once viewed as a promising 3-and-D wing. He was an important rotational piece to the Oklahoma City teams of\nRussell Westbrook and Kevin Durant. He once sank three 3-pointers and 7-of-12 shots in Game 4 of the 2016 Western Conference semifinals, pushing OKC to a 3-1 lead over the Golden State Warriors.\nThe following season, Andre earned an All-Defensive nod and a spot among basketball's top perimeter defensive stars. However, in 2018, he ruptured his left patellar tendon, which forced him to miss the remainder of the season and the following 2018-19 season.\nAfter a hiatus from basketball, the guard returned to action two years later, joining the NBA in 2020. His final stint came with the Brooklyn Nets in 2021, though he appeared in just five games.\nIt has been a grueling few years for the once-promising Roberson. But he has the opportunity to find a role in France with Cholet this season.",
