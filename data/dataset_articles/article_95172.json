  "text": "IRONMAN Wisconsin will return to the Verona area on Sunday, Sept. 8.\nAccording to a press release, athletes from around the world will converge on Madison to tackle this grueling triathlon, which features a world-renowned bike course that runs right through Verona. Known for its challenging hills and enthusiastic crowds, the Verona loop is a fan-favorite and a true test of endurance.\nLast year, IRONMAN Wisconsin was voted the #1 IRONMAN in North America for athlete experience, thanks in large part to the incredible fan support in Verona.\nThis year, IRONMAN Wisconsin hopes to see even more excitement at the annual Loop Festival on the grounds of St. Christopher’s Church, 301 N. Main St. Highlights include a brand new Fan Zone across Main Street – outside of New Century/Verona Area International School – along with a variety of food, drinks and activities:\nCoffee & Donut stand by the Knights of Columbus\nBrat & Steak Stand by the Knights of Columbus\nCustard, Sundaes & Drinks by the Verona Area High School Cross Country Club\nBaked Goods by the Verona Area High School Dance Team\nPopcorn, Beverages and Treats by the Verona Area High School Theatre Department\nPunt-Pass-Kick, Free-Throw and Soccer Contests by the Knights of Columbus\nFan Zone at New Century Charter School with an Obstacle Course, Sign-Making, Bike Loop Bingo and Scavenger Hunt. Courtesy of the Verona Area School District Community Education Program\nMotorists should note traffic delays and road closures to accommodate the event between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. According to a Facebook post from the Verona Police Department, officers will staff major intersections.\nCones will differentiate between vehicle travel and bike lanes in some areas.\n“Please be patient and plan to use alternate routes to avoid bike traffic,” the post states. “There will be an increase in traffic due to race observers and other unrelated events occurring at various locations throughout Verona that day.”\nPhoto provided by the Verona Police Department",
