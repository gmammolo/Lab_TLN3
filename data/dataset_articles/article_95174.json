  "text": "Basketball legends and fans gathered in Zagreb to honor the late Drazen Petrovic, with Team Drazen securing a 110-107 victory over the Croatian national team in a special exhibition game. Basketball stars paid tribute to the legendary Drazen Petrovic in a special Legacy Game held in Zagreb, Croatia, marking what would have been his 60th birthday. More than 15,000 fans gathered to honor Petrovic's memory. The exhibition game featured a matchup between the Croatian national team and 'Team Drazen,' coached by Zeljko Obradovic and Neven Spahija. In a thrilling finish, 'Team Drazen' secured a narrow 110-107 victory, with Dzanan Musa delivering a decisive dunk in the final 20 seconds. Mario Hezonja attempted to tie the game with a three-pointer, but his long-range shot missed the mark. [Mario Hezonja](/players/9225-mario-hezonja.html) |Team:|| | Real Madrid forward finished the match with 36 points, also winning the three-point contest during halftime.
