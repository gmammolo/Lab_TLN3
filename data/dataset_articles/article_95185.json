  "text": "A masterpiece by Max Lanza in the Czech Republic, with a victory and a second place, puts him at the top of the Challenger Trophy at the end of the EuroNASCAR regular season. The Roman driver enters the Playoffs of the American-derived series with a solid 18-point lead, a useful margin to manage the last four double-points races effectively.\nOn the challenging track in the Czech Republic, the Roman driver secured a top position in the Challenger Trophy right from the first practice sessions, coming close to breaking into the overall Top 10 among the PRO multiple times. While qualifying resulted in a second-place finish in the category, it was during the race that the #88 Camaro truly shone. “ It was a phenomenal weekend and anything but ordinary! In Race 1, I felt great; we made a strong comeback and avoided any kind of trouble. My #88 was really fast, and the results proved it: overall Top 10 and victory in the Challenger Trophy!” commented Max Lanza, which had a long thrill in Race 2. “ …which I nearly didn’t finish! When we started the engine and were moving out for the formation lap after the autograph session, a rear driveshaft completely gave out, I managed to reach the end of the pit wall and parked, convinced that my race was over right there. However, the CAAL Racing guys made the most of the extra time provided by the red flag and I was able again to restart in the second start. Simply awesome! We came away with a second place and the lead in the standings in a race that we shouldn’t even have been able to participate in! “\n“Now it’s time to focus and think about the Semifinals in Oschersleben. Two races, double points, and no room for mistakes. If we’re smart and lucky, we might even be able to manage the points at the Finals in Zolder. For now, though, fingers crossed and full throttle. Today starts a new championship!”\nThe NASCAR Whelen Euro Series now moves to Germany, where the Semifinals will take place on the weekend of September 21 and 22.\nMax Lanza PR",
