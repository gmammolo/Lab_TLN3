  "text": "E ven at 56 years old, to hear Deion Sanders tell it, the future is so bright that he needs to wear shades.\nThe head coach of the Colorado Buffaloes has retained undying confidence in his team as his second season at the helm began with a win -- albeit unconvincing -- over the North Dakota State Bison . Coach Prime 's swagger -- not to mention his ability to entice recruits out of the transfer portal -- has only grown since he moved to Boulder , even though the Buffs have mustered only a 5-8 record since the start of last season. The stock remains high, and at least one of Sanders ' former teams in the NFL has been paying attention.\nCould Sanders replace Mike McCarthy in 2025? In a recent interview, Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones spoke about Sanders and reiterated his admiration for someone he shelled out more than $30 million to sign at the height of playing career in the 1990s.\n\"First of all, you are familiar with our ... ' love affair ' that we have. I have always admired him, both on and off the field,\" Jones told ESPN's Stephen A. Smith . \"Some of the best stories that I have to tell about my time in sports have been Deion-type stories with Deion and Michael (Irvin) and those guys .\"\nJones and Sanders have a strong relationship and a close bond that goes back decades. Monday will mark the 29-year anniversary of Sanders' decision to sign with the Cowboys on a seven-year, $35 million deal complete with a $12.999 million signing bonus . Over his five seasons in Dallas , Prime Time reasserted himself as one of the top cornerbacks of his era, winning a Super Bowl in 1995 and meriting three first-team All-Pro selections before joining the Washington Commanders in 2000.\nIt remains to be seen whether Jones' longstanding admiration for Sanders becomes something more concrete -- such as an offer to coach the Cowboys once Mike McCarthy 's contract expires following the 2024 season. Dallas is not expected to extend McCarthy's contract in 2025 , especially if he can't guide the Cowboys to their first Super Bowl win since... 1995 , Sanders' first year in Dallas' defensive backfield.\nHowever, Coach Prime has been clear that he wants to build a legacy in Colorado -- even after star players Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders depart for the NFL in 2025 . While the admiration from the pro ranks may remain, Deion is the only one who can decide where his coaching future lies after 2024.",
