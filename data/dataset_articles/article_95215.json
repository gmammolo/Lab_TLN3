  "text": "Rob Gronkowski, former teammate of Tom Brady, recently made a surprising statement about the legendary quarterback&apos;s current physique. Despite retiring from the NFL in early 2023, Brady appears to be in better shape now than during his playing days, according to Gronkowski. &quot;Every time I see him, he looks better and better. It&apos;s just unbelievable how he pulls it off!&quot; Gronkowski told PEOPLE magazine. Brady has refused to rule out a return to the NFL Speculation about Brady&apos;s return to football began after his comments on the DeepCut podcast in April. The ex-Patriots and Buccaneers star mentioned that he was &quot;not opposed&quot; to coming back if the right opportunity presented itself. Although Brady is set to start his new role as an NFL analyst with Fox Sports, the possibility of seeing him on the field again isn&apos;t entirely off the table. Tom Brady&apos;s dedication to his fitness has kept him in top form. Last week, he was spotted leaving the gym, looking in remarkable shape even after nearly two years away from professional sports. His approach to fitness, which he detailed in a 2019 Men&apos;s Health interview, emphasizes muscle pliability, focusing on flexibility and ease of movement rather than raw strength. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Tom Brady (@tombrady) Adding fuel to the speculation, Brady was seen practicing with receivers during a commercial shoot for the athletic company Nobull. A video shared on his YouTube channel shows him throwing passes on the field in Miami, keeping his skills sharp despite his retirement. While Brady has shown no signs of actively returning to the NFL, he shared a recent dream about the Super Bowl on his YouTube channel. Interestingly, his dream involved him broadcasting the game, not playing in it. As Brady prepares for his high-profile $375 million deal with Fox Sports, his focus appears to be on excelling in the broadcast booth. Gronkowski believes that Brady will thrive in his new role as an NFL analyst. &quot;If anyone can pull it off, it&apos;s definitely him,&quot; Gronkowski stated. He praised Brady&apos;s public speaking skills and football knowledge, emphasizing that his understanding of the game will make him just as successful in the booth as he was on the field. &quot;He knows just every little thing about the game of football, and that&apos;s what made him so good.&quot;",
