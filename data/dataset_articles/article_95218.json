He signed a three-year contract worth $82.6 million with a signing bonus of $25.7 million and $48 million in guaranteed money. Williams is coming off a phenomenal year wherein he had a 95.8% pass-block win rate. The move was commended by fans of the 49ers.\nTom Brady, former NFL quarterback and now an analyst for Fox Sports, praised the\nSan Francisco 49ers for not letting Trent Williams walk. In his most recent appearance on The Herd with Colin Cowherd, Brady revealed that if he were in Brock Purdy’s position, he would have gone out of his way to ensure the left tackle returned.\nI would be driving him to work every day if I was the quarterback. I'd be making sure Trent was with me every single place I went. There's no better protector in the NFL than Trent over the years.Tom Brady said\nWilliams has played a key role in ensuring Brock Purdy’s exposed blind side is protected at all times. Brady gave props to the talent on the 49ers’ offensive roster but believes that without\nTrent Williams, the team’s run game would not be as good.\nObviously, San Francisco's run game is incredible, the way they scheme their run game up, but having Trent in there it's an entirely different offense because of his athleticism, his rare combination of size, of quickness, of power. When he gets out there on the field, he's a matchup advantage for the 49ers every time he takes a snap.Tom Brady added\nThe seven-time Super Bowl champion understands the importance of having a tackle who is athletic, strong, and possesses quick reflexes.\nTrent Williams held out from the 49ers minicamp and preseason until he signed his extension\nDue to Williams’ ability to do his job at the highest level, the 49ers are in a position to make the most out of their run game and give Brock Purdy enough time to read the defense and make the right throw. Brady iterated that when 71 is out there on the field, the quarterback and the running back can be sure that they will be protected.\nWhen they have him out there, they all feel confident, a lot of those plays are going to go to the left side of the line of scrimmage right behind him. They know that when he's in pass protection he's going to hold up as well as anybody, it doesn't matter who he's going up against. He's a tremendous player.Tom Brady said\nTom Brady broke down the importance of having a player of Trent Williams’ caliber in one’s corner. His consistency has shown that there is no reason for his teammates to question his abilities no matter who he goes up against.\nTom Brady on how important it was to get Trent Williams back on the field:— Coach Yac 🗣 (@Coach_Yac)\n“I would be driving him to work every day if I was the quarterback. I’d be making sure Trent was with me every single place I went. There’s no better protector in the NFL than Trent over the years.…\n[pic.twitter.com/ohZYlc15Lg] [September 4, 2024]\nSince joining the 49ers in 2020, Trent Williams has been atop\nPro Football Focus‘ grades for tackles with the exception of 2023 wherein he ranked 2nd. Williams has posted exceptional run-blocking grades with a 97.7 grade in 2021, the highest by any offensive lineman in PFF history. If the 49ers had failed to retain Williams, their offense would have undoubtedly struggled.\nIt has been a stressful free agency for Kyle Shanahan and John Lynch who have\nworked overtime to ensure they retain Brandon Aiyuk and Trent Williams but it is safe to say that the 49ers have just as good a shot this season to return to the Super Bowl.\nIn case you missed it:",
