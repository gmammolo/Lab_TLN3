  "text": "Stephen Kenny's young wonder Mason Melia proved the match winner as he came off the bench to earn just a second away win of the season for St Patrick’s Athletic against Dundalk at Oriel Park after his own teenage talent had threatened an upset.\nIt had briefly looked like the former Republic of Ireland manager’s son Eoin was going to spoil his father's first managerial return to Oriel Park since departing the Lilywhites for the international setup almost six years ago.\nThe 18-year-old had put Jon Daly’s side ahead inside the opening two minutes only for the Inchicore man to fight their way back in the second half to win away from Richmond Park for the first time since the opening day victory against Galway United in Eamonn Deacy Park back in February.\nTom Grivosti equalised 10 minutes into the second half with an acrobatic effort before 16-year-old Melia, who could have been away with the Republic of Ireland Under-19s, came off the bench to bundle home the winner 13 minutes later to further boost his side’s hopes of getting back into the race for Europe.\nWhile the defeat ensured Dundalk remained at the foot of the table, the Louth side have bigger concerns on the horizon amid reports that owner Brian Ainscough is lookingt to offload the club.\nTo their credit, the players didn’t let that impact them and they got off to a dream start when they hit the front after just 79 seconds.\nDan Pike’s long throw was helped on by Hayden Cann with Eoin Kenny pouncing with a stooping header from close range to nod past Joseph Anang.\nEoin Kenny scored the first league goal of his career While Daryl Horgan fired just over monents later, it was St Pat's who had the bulk of the chances to level in the period afterwards with Felix Goddard flirting with disaster on a number of occasions.\nThe on loan Blackburn Rovers keeper was caught in no man’s land on four minutes after coming out of his box but was let off the hook when Brandon Kavanagh’s effort beat him only to clip the post.\nHe then had another near calamity 10 minutes later when he duffed a clearance under little pressure with Aidan Keena almost lobbing him only for the 20-year-old to get back in the nick of time to just about keep his effort out.\nAfter Ryan O’Kane had shot pushed away by Joseph Anang on 17 minutes, Goddard was again left breathing a sigh of relief on 38 minutes when he misjudged Jake Mulraney’s cross from the left only to be let off the hook when it bounced up and off his face for a corner which proved fruitless.\nIn between Cann had got on the end of a Horgan corner at the other end but his downward header was straight at Anang.\nBefore the break Jamie Lennon also had an effort from range which was kept out by Goddard with the aid of a deflection.\nPat’s were level within 10 minutes of the restart, however, as a free kick was headed down by Joe Redmond for his centre back partner Grivosti to hook the ball to the net past a statuesque Goddard.\nDundalk did go close to an instantly reply but efforts from Jad Hakiki and Horgan were blocked before the visitors hit the front on 68 minutes when Mulraney’s cross from the right was bundled over the line by Melia.\nThe Louth men then had a big chance to level two mintues later when Horgan’s free fell to Andy Boyle at the back post.\nHis strike beat Anang but was hacked off the line by Lennon.Brandon Kavanagh then had a chance to seal the game for St Pat’s three minutes later but he couldn’t beat Goddard from close range.\nDundalk felt they should have had a penalty in stoppage time but their appeals fell on deaf ears after Dara Keane took a tumble in the box.\nDundalk: Felix Goddard; Dan Pike, Andy Boyle, Hayden Cann, John Mountney; Aodh Dervin (Dara Keane 87), Robbie Benson (Jamie Gullan 69); Daryl Horgan, Jad Hakiki (Scott McGill 69), Ryan O’Kane (Norman Garbett 75); Eoin Kenny (Robbie Mahon 75).\nSt Patrick’s Athletic: Joseph Anang; Axel Sjoberg, Joe Redmond, Tom Grivosti, Anto Breslin; Jamie Lennon, Chris Forrester; Zach Elbouzedi, Brandon Kavanagh (Aaron Bolger 83), Jake Mulraney (Jason McClelland 72) Aidan Keena (Mason Melia 62).Referee: Damien MacGraith (Mayo).",
