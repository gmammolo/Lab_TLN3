  "text": "Hug No. 1 from the No. 1 hugger is in the books.\n“I had one yesterday, so, finally,” Joonas Korpisalo said of his first interaction with fellow Bruins goalie Jeremy Swayman following Thursday’s captain’s practice at Warrior Arena.\nKorpisalo was acquired in June from the Senators along with forward Mark Kastelic and a 2024 first-round draft pick ( Dean Letourneau ) for Linus Ullmark , Swayman’s former hugging partner.\n“It came as a surprise, but as days went by, I was really happy,” said Korpisalo. “I am excited to get back here and just get to work with the boys.\n“Things happen for a reason. I’m here right now and super excited.”\nA nine-year veteran, Korpisalo is slated to be Swayman’s primary backup, though he could be thrust into a bigger role in the unlikely event that Swayman, currently a restricted free agent, can’t come to terms on a new contract.\nAdvertisement\n“I don’t know, we’ll see,” Korpisalo said. “We both do our best and I think the coaches know more. We just do our stuff, so we’ll see.”\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Enter Email Sign Up Korpisalo (115-107-29, 3.06 goals against average) is particularly interested in working with goalie coach Bob Essensa , who has helped guide three Bruins netminders ( Tim Thomas , Tuukka Rask , and Ullmark) to Vezina Trophies.\n“Seeing how the Boston goalies play here, I’m really excited to see Bob and get to work with him and see what’s on his mind to make my game better,” said Korpisalo. “We’ve been talking a lot. He’s not here yet but we’ve been catching up with each other throughout the summer.”\nIdeally, the Bruins would love to see Korpisalo regain the form he flashed during a late-season run with the Kings in 2023 after he was traded by the Blue Jackets.\nBased largely on that performance, Korpisalo landed a five-year, $20 million deal with Ottawa. The Senators are paying 25 percent of that contract, which runs through 2027-28.\n“That was a good stretch,” said Korpisalo. “It was a good team. I got there pretty late, 10-15 games before the playoffs. But there’s something to learn from the playoffs. We didn’t go through. But I’ve had good stretches before, too. It’s just being myself. That’s pretty much it.”\nAdvertisement\nHe isn’t very worried about fitting into the Bruins’ systems.\n“We get only one job, it’s to stop the puck, so that’s the same in every team,” said Korpisalo. “Obviously how the defensemen play and what the play calls for when playing the puck. I think that’s the biggest thing for a goalie and special teams.”\nKorpisalo, who spent part of the summer in his native Finland, wore a vintage Bruce Springsteen “Born in the USA” concert t-shirt in the locker room.\n“I was in Helsinki a month ago, that’s where I bought this,” said Korpisalo, who listed “Born in the USA,” as his favorite Boss song. “Oh yeah, he came to Helsinki. He hasn’t been there many times. [I saw him] the first time in 2012 and again this summer.”\nKeeping busy Thursday’s session was broken into two parts, featuring a lot of on three-on-three work, leading to plenty of work for Swayman, Korpisalo, and Brandon Bussi ... Assistant coach John McLean ran the troops through some conditioning sprints (think Herb Brooks in Norway: “Again.”) just before the break ... The Bruins may have stumbled upon a new secret shootout weapon, as defenseman Drew Bavaro showed some nifty moves in beating Swayman on three consecutive attempts before Swayman thwarted the rook on back-to-back efforts ... Similar to Tuesday, captain Brad Marchand skated before the practice as he continues to ramp up his conditioning following three summer surgeries (elbow, groin, sports hernia) ... New Bruin Elias Lindholm was once a linemate of Johnny Gaudreau with the Flames. The deaths of Johnny and his brother Matthew Gaudreau last week were painful for Lindholm. “It’s been tough,” he said. “I’ve only talked to my wife about it. It gives me chills right now talking about it. It’s kind of emotional. He was a good friend. Yeah, it’s tough.” … Kristian Kostadinski , whom the Bruins drafted in the seventh round in 2023, has committed to Boston College for the 2025-26 academic year. The 6-foot-6-inch Swedish defenseman is set to play for Dubuque in the USHL this season. “I am extremely grateful and honored to announce my commitment to play Division 1 hockey at Boston College,” he wrote on Instagram.\nAdvertisement",
