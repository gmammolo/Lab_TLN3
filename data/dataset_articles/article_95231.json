  "text": "Craig Bellamy racked up his 400th NRL victory as a head coach on Thursday evening. His minor premiership-winning Storm side demolished the Broncos 50-12 in Brisbane, as attention now turns to the finals. Led on the field this season by potential Dally M Medal winner Jahrome Hughes, Melbourne have confidently navigated injuries to stars including Ryan Papenhuyzen and Cameron Munster. This has seen plenty of young and relatively inexperienced talent incorporated into the Storm's first-grade side throughout 2024. NRL LATEST NEWS: NRL live ladder | Every NRL club's updated injury list | Every NRL fixture and result for each club When asked what the difference between last year's side and the current squad is, the Storm coach highlighted three versatile, up-and-coming players. \"We've had injury setbacks ... but the guys that have come in have done such a good job,\" Bellamy said post-match on Thursday. \"Guys like [Tyran] Wishart, Grant Anderson and Jack Howarth. \"There's been a lot of players that have come into the team for different reasons ... but they've just really performed and kicked on. \"I think that's the reason [behind our 2024 improvement] to be quite honest. \"You put a player in there and he's probably not quite ready for first grade because he hasn't played much ... but these guys have seemed to really grab that opportunity and run with it and make a success of it.\" MORE: When did Melbourne Storm last win the NRL? In particular, Wishart's value this season has been undeniable. The 24-year-old has now racked up 50 NRL career appearances and finishes the 2024 regular season with 12 tries to his name – the equal-second-most of any player at the Storm. With the exciting Sualauvi Fa'alogo suffering an apparent hamstring issue against the Broncos, Wishart is essentially locked in for a bench utility role in their qualifying final next week. Howarth also looks set to keep his spot in the centres, having impressed since claiming the starting gig in Round 17. Anderson, however, appears to have lost his spot on the wing. He was dropped for Xavier Coates in Round 27, with the Origin star returning from a 10-week injury layoff.",
