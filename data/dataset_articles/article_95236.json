  "text": "The city of Beaver Dam held a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Aug. 28 for the new JM Kastenmeier Pickleball Courts, a premier 9-court pickleball complex at Athletic Field Park. The project is a collaborative effort between the city of Beaver Dam, local volunteers, and the Beaver Dam Area Community Foundation to transform the existing courts.\nCity officials including Mayor Mike Wissell, alder Bobbi Marck, city administrator Nathan Thiel, donors, the volunteer pickleball committee, the BDACF, and contractors gathered to commemorate this milestone.\n“These new courts provide a fantastic venue for residents to stay active, socialize, and enjoy the outdoors,” said Mayor Wissell. “This project stands as a testament to what can be achieved when we come together with a shared vision for enhancing our city's recreational facilities.”\nThe celebration offered a tour of the new facility and a pickleball clinic. The facility is open to the public from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily.\nPeople are also reading… 5 WiscNews-area high school football stars for Week 2 Columbus upends 3-time state champion La Crosse Aquinas, avenging its playoff loss 5 high school boys soccer stars of the week: Sept. 5 edition Here are the Week 2 WiscNews-area high school football scores and Week 3 schedule 5 high school girls golf stars of the week: Aug. 29 edition Beaver Dam Middle and Washington Elementary schools to be open for tours on Saturday morning Man, 23, faces homicide charge after police find UW-Whitewater student dead with gunshot wounds Reedsburg Just-A-Game opening Tuesday Prairie Hill Village development coming to West Baraboo Vote for the Week 3 high school football game we should cover 7 of the oddest lost and found items from the 2024 Sturgis Motorcycle Rally Polzin: Wisconsin's football lack of playmakers glaring in ugly opening win 3 employees injured in kitchen fire at Portage restaurant Wisconsin Dells Middle School counselor charged with sexual assault of student Dells Middle School counselor arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a student For more information, contact Nathan Thiel at nthiel@ci.beaverdam.wi.gov or 920-356-2549 or to connect with other players, visit cityofbeaverdam.com/pickleball .",
