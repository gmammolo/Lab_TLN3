  "text": "Faisal Halum, one of Texas’ top-producing brokers, has moved to Compass from Briggs Freeman Sotheby’s International Real Estate. Faisal Halum Group, his four-agent team, ranked second in Texas by volume with $188 million last year, according to [RealTrends Verified](https://www.realtrends.com/ranking/best-real-estate-agents-texas/teams-small-volume/). Halum’s move comes as fundamental changes to the brokerage business spread across the industry, spurred by [NAR’s landmark commissions settlement](/national/2024/03/15/heres-what-nars-landmark-commissions-settlement-means/) and continued high mortgage rates. Beyond agent compensation, subtler changes are also happening in the Dallas market. Halum’s background in architecture, along with a degree in building construction, has helped him specialize in selling architecturally significant homes, estates and high-rise condominiums to high-profile athletes, celebrities and socialites. In particular, Faisal says Dallas condos are undervalued. “Dallas has really never been known as a condo market — especially to locals it hasn’t — but that’s changing,” he says. While Dallas buyers don’t normally spring for condos as often as single-family homes compared to other major cities, condos were sold for less per square foot on average than single-family homes in July, $240 and $248, respectively, compared to $261 per square foot on average for condos and $187 for single-family homes in Texas as a whole, according to [flyhomes](https://flyhomes.com/en/housing-market-analysis/dallas--tx). Halum has been active in the high-end condo market, but he has a solid footing in single-family home and estate sales; he recently facilitated the sale of a 9,000 square foot ultra-modern estate near Preston Hollow in May, last listed for $7.85 million, and another home last listed at $750,000 near Munger Place, according to Zillow. His sales volume this year, so far, is well over $100 million, he estimates.
