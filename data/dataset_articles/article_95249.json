Listen, Hutch has had a tremendous offseason. He had a tremendous training camp,” Glenn said. “And now he’s at that point where he needs to set his sights at being, if not the best defensive player in this league then one of the best, which he is. But now it’s time for him to (make) himself the best player.”\nALIM MCNEILL GROWING AT A RAPID PACE Part of the reason for the growing excitement about Detroit’s defensive line is the growth of defensive tackle Alim McNeill.\nEntering 2024, many are projecting McNeill will have a breakout season, especially with the addition of veteran DJ Reader to the roster.\n“When it comes to Mac, man listen, he was growing at a rapid pace last year until he got the injury when he was out for like four games or what not,” Glenn said. “And then he came back and played in the Minnesota game for a couple reps and then he played in the playoffs. You saw those flashes of him being a dominant player. I look at him the same way I look at Hutch. I expect him to be a dominant player in this league.”\nThis article was produced by the staff at Detroit Lions On SI. For more, visit si.com/nfl/lions",
