  "text": "USC to retire Caleb Williams’ jersey, add Reggie Bush Heisman banner back to Coliseum\nUSC is set to honor Heisman Trophy winners\nCaleb Williams and Reggie Bush by retiring Williams' No. 13 jersey and reintroducing Bush's Heisman banner back to the L.A. Coliseum. Williams, who won the Heisman Trophy in 2022 and was the first overall pick in the NFL Draft, will have his number retired in line with USC tradition for Heisman winners. Bush's banner celebration comes following the reinstatement of his 2005 Heisman Trophy, which had been stripped from him years ago. Both will be celebrated during the Trojans' home opener against Utah State.\n- Caleb Williams is the eighth Heisman winner in USC history to have his jersey retired.\n- USC is hosting six home games this season, including matchups against top-ranked teams like Wisconsin and Notre Dame.\nWhile Williams' recognition is significant, it raises questions about whether he'll be able to participate in any celebrations due to conflicting NFL commitments. There is also the ongoing discussion surrounding Reggie Bush's controversial past with the NCAA.State of Play\n- Caleb Williams' NFL debut is imminent, raising uncertainties about his return to USC for formal acknowledgment.\n- Reggie Bush is anticipated to make a comeback to the Trojan program, though a specific date is not yet set.\nFans can expect to see Williams' jersey retirement and Bush's return in the upcoming home game. The athletic department may look to leverage these honors to boost attendance and enthusiasm for the season.Bottom Line\nUSC's decision to retire Caleb Williams' jersey and reinstate Reggie Bush's banner is more than a tribute; it represents a reclaiming of the school's storied history. As excitement builds, the spotlight is on how these honors will invigorate the community and define the current season.\nRead more at\n Saturday Tradition\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
