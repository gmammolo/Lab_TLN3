  "text": "Fox Sports college football analyst Joel Klatt is on the [Texas Longhorns](https://www.burntorangenation.com) train. During a talking-head conversation earlier this week, Klatt gushed over Texas’ offense. In particular, Texas’ speed a wide receiver. Altogether, Klatt implies Texas is the real deal this season. “Texas looks like Alabama has looked and Georgia has looked,” Klatt explained, per [On3](https://www.on3.com/news/joel-klatt-believes-texas-longhorns-speed-will-cause-michigan-wolverines-problems/). “That’s what Sark is building. He left Alabama and he left the Nick Saban tree. That’s what he’s building from a roster. What I like about Sark has done is that he didn’t go try to copy Nick Saban from a personality standpoint or philosophy but he did look at that roster at Alabama and say, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s how you win. That’s how you win’. This looks like an early-2000s USC team. It looks like the Alabama teams and the Georgia teams.” WHAT THEY’RE SAYING ABOUT THE LONGHORNS [Austin American-Statesman](https://subscribe.statesman.com/restricted?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statesman.com%2Fstory%2Fsports%2Fcolumns%2F2024%2F09%2F05%2Fgolden-longhorn-dusty-mangums-rose-bowl-kick-lives-on-20-years-later%2F75043194007%2F&gps-source=CPROADBLOCKDH&gca-cat=p&gca-uir=true&gca-epti=z119977p119977c119977u115150e002908v004150&sltsgmt=1001_B_20&gnt-eid=control): Golden: Longhorn ex Mangum revisits [Rose Bowl](http://www.sbnation.com/rose-bowl) kick that beat Michigan [Dallas Morning News](https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/texas-longhorns/2024/09/05/college-football-week-2-predictions-picks-for-20-games-including-texas-michigan-byu-smu/): College football Week 2 predictions: Picks for 20 games, including Texas-Michigan, [BYU](https://www.vanquishthefoe.com)-SMU [Dallas Morning News](https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/texas-longhorns/2024/09/04/qa-with-fs1s-emmanuel-acho-texas-michigan-12-team-cfp-and-why-sports-need-less-debate/): Q&A with FS1′s Emmanuel Acho: Texas-Michigan, 12-team CFP and why sports need less debate [247Sports](https://247sports.com/college/texas/longformarticle/the-insider-texas-longhorns-football-nuggets-galore-ahead-of-michigan-game-235684093/): The Insider: Nuggets galore ahead of Texas hitting the road to take on Michigan [247Sports](https://247sports.com/college/texas/longformarticle/horns247-staff-predictions-no-3-texas-longhorns-no-10-michigan-wolverines-235688110/): Horns247 Staff Predictions: No. 3 Texas vs. No. 10 Michigan [247Sports](https://247sports.com/college/texas/article/former-texas-great-jermichael-finley-says-rose-bowl-between-texas-michigan-influenced-college-decision--235687894/): Former Texas great Jermichael Finley says Rose Bowl between Texas, Michigan influenced college decision [247Sports](https://247sports.com/college/texas/article/expanded-texas-wr-rotation-a-really-comforting-thing-for-steve-sarkisian-longhorns-after-productive-opener-235676187/): Expanded Texas WR rotation ‘a really comforting thing’ for Steve Sarkisian, Longhorns after productive opener [247Sports](https://247sports.com/college/texas/article/grading-the-longhorns-can-the-texas-defenses-shutout-performance-carry-over-to-the-michigan-game-235675136/): Grading the Longhorns: Can the Texas defense’s shutout performance carry over to the Michigan game?
