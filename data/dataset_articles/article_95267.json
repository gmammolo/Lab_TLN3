  "text": "Ty France spoiled a pitchers' duel with a go-ahead solo shot in the bottom of the seventh inning, lifting the host Cincinnati Reds to a 1-0 win over the Houston Astros on Thursday afternoon. France sent Houston reliever Bryan Abreu's second pitch of the inning over the wall in left-center to help Cincinnati (68-73) complete a three-game series sweep. Tony Santillan (2-2), who got the final two outs of the seventh, logged a scoreless eighth for the Reds. Alexis Diaz notched his 25th save of the season with a 1-2-3 ninth. Abreu (2-3) took the loss. Both starters had to settle for no-decisions despite recording quality starts. Making his second career big-league start, Cincinnati right-hander Rhett Lowder gave up four hits across 6 1/3 scoreless innings. He walked four and struck out three. Astros righty Hunter Brown went six shutout innings, allowing four hits while walking one and fanning six. France and Jake Fraley each finished with two hits for the Reds. Jeremy Pena went 2-for-4 for Houston (75-65). It looked like the Astros were going to break the seal in the top of the seventh, as Ben Gamel walked with one out and advanced to third on Chas McCormick's single. However, Santillan took over on the mound and got Victor Caratini to ground into an inning-ending double play. Tempers flared after a pitch seemingly grazed Houston third baseman Alex Bregman's elbow in the fourth inning. Umpires apparently thought Bregman hit a foul ball off the handle of his bat, prompting Astros manager Joe Espada to challenge a call that stood upon video review. Bregman went on to strike out looking. Bregman had some words for plate umpire Brian O'Nora as he was walking back to the dugout. Espada chimed in, too, and O'Nora tossed the Houston skipper from the game. Cincinnati proceeded to load the bases with two outs in the home half of the fourth, but Santiago Espinal grounded into a forceout to end the frame. --Field Level Media\n[]",
