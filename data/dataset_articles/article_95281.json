  "text": "Celebrity Celebrity Family Celebrity Family Dynamics Lamar Jackson's 3 Siblings: All About His Brother Jamar and 2 Sisters Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is the oldest of three siblings, including his brother Jamar and two younger sisters By Rebecca Aizin Rebecca Aizin Rebecca Aizin is an Editorial Assistant at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2023. Her work has previously appeared on Elle, HGTV and Backstage. People Editorial Guidelines Published on September 5, 2024 04:46PM EDT Close Lamar Jackson after a play against the Los Angeles Chargers during the fourth quarter in the AFC Wild Card Playoff game at M&T Bank Stadium on January 06, 2019. Photo: Patrick Smith/Getty Lamar Jackson is a loving older brother to three younger siblings, including his brother Jamar. The Baltimore Ravens quarterback was born to Felicia Jones and Lamar Jackson Sr. in 1997. Lamar became a brother three times with the birth of Jamar and his two sisters, whose names are not known. When he was 8 years old, his father died, leaving his mother to raise four children alone. “If she can do that, I can do anything,” he once said at a press conference. \"This woman’s a superhero to me.” All About Lamar Jackson’s Mom, Felicia Jones Though his sisters are more private, Lamar's siblings have continued to support his career since he was drafted in 2018. From how they grew up to the tattoo Lamar has in their honor, here's everything to know about Lamar Jackson's siblings. They grew up in Florida Lamar Jackson stands with mom Felicia James after winning the Heisman award in 2016. John Angelillo/UPI/Alamy Lamar and his siblings were raised in Pompano Beach, Fla. When Lamar was 8 years old, his father died of a heart attack. That same day, his grandmother also died. Lamar has since given back to the Pompano Beach community, opening Play Action Soulfood, a restaurant serving some of his favorite home-cooked meals. \"My mother raised the four of us — my younger brother and my two younger sisters,\" Lamar told Shoutout Miami in July 2023. \"I remember coming into the kitchen to the smell of her cooking. Even until this day, she won’t let her recipes go. But she and my grandmother taught me everything I know in the kitchen.\" Jamar shared a sweet message to Lamar ahead of his NFL draft Ahead of Lamar's draft day in 2018, he received a touching message from his brother and mother expressing their pride in him as he began his NFL journey. “From the time we were younger, I always knew you were special, I just didn’t know how important it was from when we were outside playing to you jumping over my head in the backyard,” Jamar said in the video. “From ever since we was younger to high school playing with each other, I always loved you. You make my life special. I wouldn’t know what to do without you.” He continued that whenever Lamar was away, he always wanted to talk to him and call him, reminiscing on how the two played together when they were young. Jamar added that after their father's death in 2005, their life changed, and Lamar helped him through it. Now, he added, he is especially proud of Lamar's career and believes in his potential. \"You gonna be one of the best players ever, I could see you being a hall of famer one day,\" he said. After the video, Lamar got emotional and said he loves his brother \"to death\" and that his message \"touched [his] soul.\" Lamar has a tattoo dedicated to Jamar Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens poses for a portrait after winning MVP at the 13th Annual NFL Honors on February 8, 2024. Todd Rosenberg/Getty Lamar made his love for his siblings permanent with a tattoo on his arm dedicated to his younger brother. The art reads \"My Brother's Keeper,\" referencing the protection he feels over Jamar. In 2020, Lamar also got a new tattoo across his chest that included his mom's name, the word \"FAMILY\" written in large letters and a football in the center of it all, further cementing his adoration for his loved ones. They have a niece The two-time NFL MVP became a father on Jan. 4, 2021, with the birth of his daughter Milan, making Jamar an uncle and Lamar's two sisters aunts. Though Lamar has kept most details about his daughter private — including the identity of her mother — he has shared rare photos of him celebrating events from Halloween to her birthday on his social media. In January 2022, Lamar shared a snap of himself celebrating Milan's, who he affectionately calls Lani, 1st birthday on his Instagram Stories. The toddler giggled as she had food all over her face. “🤣🤣Happy 1st Girl day Mami,” Jackson wrote over the photo.",
