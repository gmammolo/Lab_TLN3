  "text": "Razorbacks Open 2024-25 Season at the Folds of Honor Collegiate FAYETTEVILLE – For the second consecutive year, the Arkansas men’s golf program will open its season by playing in the Folds of Honor Collegiate, played Sept. 9-11 in Grand Haven, Mich., at American Dunes Golf Club. GOLF Channel will broadcast men’s action live each day – Monday: 3:30-6:30 pm (CT), Tuesday: 8:30-11:30 am and Wednesday: 3:30-6:30 pm (CT). The Razorbacks, which placed third at last year’s Folds of Honor Collegiate, is ranked #17 in the preseason coaches poll and will take a fresh lineup to this year’s tournament. Thomas Curry and Matthis Lefevre return from last year’s squad, but the pair did not participate in last year’s event. However, they finished 2023-24 strong. Curry was named to the SEC All-Freshman team and posted the fourth-best season scoring average by a Razorback rookie. Lefevre had a 71.785 scoring average in his six events with four top-20 finishes, including a T-17 result with two match play wins at the 2024 SEC Championship. The other three Razorbacks that qualified for this year’s Folds of Honor Collegiate include freshmen Gerardo Gomez and Erich Fortlage – two players that helped make up the fourth-best recruiting class in the nation – and transfer Mark Stockdale, who was named the ASUN Freshman of the Year last season at UCA.
