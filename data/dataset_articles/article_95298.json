  "text": "Matt Healy is hoping he will have two reasons to celebrate on Friday night.\nWhile the midfielder is focussing on helping the Republic of Ireland take another huge step towards qualifying for the U21 Euros when they take on Turkey on Friday, he is also hoping his former side Cork City get the win they need away to UCD to secure the First Division title, and a swift return to the Premier Division, later that evening.\n“I’ve been watching them in the league, I’ve a couple of friends still there as well so fair play to them, they’d a job to do and they’re getting it done.\n\"Hopefully they do it Friday,” said Healy.\nThe playmaker, who won the First Division with City back in 2022, opted for a move to Royal Francs Borains in Belgium last summer rather than remaining with the Rebel Army.\nHealy was looking for a new challenge in order to develop as a footballer and it has certainly presented some obstacles for him to navigate.\n“It was different, put it that way. They all speak French there, so it was hard at the start, meetings in French, even the dressing room everything was in French, so I didn’t know what was going on.\n“But we’ve got a couple of English-speaking lads in the dressing room as well, they help me out and integrate me into the team.\n“It’s just thrown me into a new environment know what I mean. European football, there is different styles in European football so I’m trying to learn how European players play compared to standard UK and Irish players, and it is different coaching styles as well, so I think that’s…it’s improved my game in that way learning different styles of play and stuff like that.\n“It’s good, I’ve gained a lot of experience, played a football which was the aim going over, I played nearly every game, nearly every minute, that was the most important thing really. I’m enjoying it.”\nMeanwhile, Cole Palmer, Ollie Watkins and Phil Foden have been ruled out of England’s forthcoming UEFA Nations League fixtures, the FA have announced.\nThe Three Lions squad reported to St. George’s Park on Tuesday but, following assessment, both Palmer and Watkins returned to Chelsea and Aston Villa respectively to continue their rehabilitation for their ongoing issues.\nManchester City's Phil Foden did not meet up with the squad as he continues to struggle with illness and he has also dropped out for the matches against the Republic of Ireland at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday before they host Finland at Wembley on Tuesday night.",
