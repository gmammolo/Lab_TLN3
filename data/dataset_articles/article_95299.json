  "text": "The Kansas City Chiefs will kick off their quest for a three-peat with the opening game of the 2024 regular season, an AFC Championship rematch against the Baltimore Ravens this evening.\nEvery game counts moving forward, as Arrowhead Stadium will be loud and ready to celebrate last year’s accomplishment and look forward to more success starting tonight.\nThough Kansas City will have an edge playing at home, Baltimore added some serious firepower to its offense during the offseason by signing star running back Derrick Henry, who could wreck the Chiefs’ gameplan in Week 1.\nCheck out our predictions for Kansas City’s matchup against Baltimore:\nEd Easton Jr.'s Prediction\nJan 28, 2024; Baltimore, Maryland, USA; Kansas City Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco (10) carries the ball against the Baltimore Ravens during the first half in the AFC Championship football game at M&T Bank Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Kansas City Chiefs’ regular season is officially underway with the much-anticipated matchup with the Baltimore Ravens. On banner night, a celebratory Arrowhead Stadium crowd will rock for the defending champions.\nPatrick Mahomes and the offense will look to get off to a fast start by showcasing the team’s new weapons. Isiah Pacheco’s consistency will be essential in the running game, as the Chiefs want to maintain a healthy balance without relying too much on Mahomes or Travis Kelce. The Ravens’ defense is talented, so the offense must avoid turnovers and poor field position.\nOn defense, Chris Jones on the defensive line will play their first game together since Super Bowl LVIII after the All-Pro missed preseason play. The cornerback position will be the group to watch as everyone after Trent McDuffie is a question mark heading into Thursday. Special teams with the new look kickoff are also important, but the Chiefs have a former Pro Bowler in Mecole Hardman and third-year receiver Skyy Moore as viable options.\nThe Chiefs should be solid enough to pull off the victory to start the new season and win the game.\nFinal Score: Chiefs 28, Ravens 17\nJon Ediger's Prediction\nKANSAS CITY, MO – SEPTEMBER 22: Defensive end Emmanuel Ogbah #90 of the Kansas City Chiefs sacks quarterback Lamar Jackson #8 of the Baltimore Ravens during the second half at Arrowhead Stadium on September 22, 2019 in Kansas City, Missouri. (Photo by Peter Aiken/Getty Images)\nThe 2024 regular season is officially here, as the Baltimore Ravens head to Kansas City to face the Chiefs in a much-anticipated Thursday night matchup.\nFor the Ravens, banner night means revenge, after the Chiefs bested Baltimore in the AFC Championship Game earlier this year en route to their second-straight Super Bowl victory.\nThe loss of wide receiver Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown in tonight’s game could prove to be a major factor in the outcome, but given Kansas City’s newfound depth at the wide receiver position, it seems likely that the former Sooner’s teammates will be able to up the slack.\nReigning MVP Lamar Jackson is a force to be reckoned with, and should be expected to have a big game tonight, but defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo’s defense has trained all offseason for this game and will have an answer.\nFinal Score: Chiefs 34, Ravens 23.\nAndrew Garcia's prediction\nJan 28, 2024; Baltimore, Maryland, USA; Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes (15) prepares for a snap during the second half against the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship football game at M&T Bank Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\nBoth of these teams got better during the offseason, and perhaps if this game was being played at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore the Ravens would have a better chance at getting revenge on Kansas City in this matchup.\nGiven that the Chiefs will be celebrating their Super Bowl LVIII victory in front of a home crowd, it seems unlikely that the defending champions will come out flat against such a high-profile opponent, especially after their Week 1 collapse last season.\nBaltimore’s roster is outstanding, and the Ravens have all the talent they need to pull off an upset to spoil Kansas City’s party, but the Chiefs seem like the logical choice tonight.\nFinal Score: Chiefs 13, Ravens 10\nJohn Dillon's prediction\nKANSAS CITY, MISSOURI – SEPTEMBER 22: Defensive end Chris Jones #95 of the Kansas City Chiefs reacts against the Baltimore Ravens in the first quarter during the game at Arrowhead Stadium on September 22, 2019 in Kansas City, Missouri. (Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images)\nThe outcome of this matchup will come down to Kansas City’s ability to contain Baltimore’s new-look ground game that has All-World running back Derrick Henry paired with Lamar Jackson, who is a dynamo in his own right.\nThough the Chiefs have been able to contain Henry and Jackson individually in the past, this new dynamic in the Ravens’ offense could prove to be too much for Kansas City to handle, and lead to disastrous results for the home team if they let Baltimore get out to an early lead.\nTo me, this game is a toss-up, and could truly go either way. For now, though, I’ll call it in the Chiefs’ favor and predict a 1-0 start to Kansas City’s season.\nFinal Score: Chiefs 32, Ravens 28\nMore Chiefs content\nJan 9, 2011; Kansas City, MO, USA; Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Tamba Hali (91) celebrates after a sack against the Baltimore Ravens during the 2011 AFC wild card playoff at Arrowhead Stadium.
