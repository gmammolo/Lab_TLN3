  "text": "12 places to watch football in Charleston\nGet your football fix at one of these Charleston locations.\nIt’s officially football season. Last week, we asked you where your favorite spot to watch the game when you’re looking get off the couch, but you’re not making a trip to see the action in person — here’s what you told us.\nKickin’ Chicken | Cheer on your team at any of its convenient locations. There are plenty of screens and outdoor seating, and the Bobby Fries might just be the best thing ever. Bumpa’s | This cozy spot hosts watch parties for every University of Wisconsin football games and while all fans are welcome Georgia, Fordham, and Steelers fans might feel a little extra at home. Red Palm Tavern | This spot stands out for its vintage tavern style, featuring a wood-fired menu, and has a patio, billiards, and darts for you to enjoy during halftime. Fam’s Brewing Co. | Readers enjoy catching the game here because all you need is pizza, beer, and football...right? Islander 71 | Watching touchdowns will be a treat at the Isle of Palms location, which boasts several TVs and a large screen. Enjoying the game with waterfront views is always a good idea. Hunley’s Neighborhood Grill | This West Ashley neighborhood bar and grill is a great choice, offering a range of TVs and a menu filled with soul food, sandwiches, and wings. Mex 1 Coastal Cantina | The Sullivan’s Island location features a new projector screen, along with an updated gameday menu. Guests can also enter a special contest each week for a chance to win two tickets to this year’s Clemson vs. Carolina game. King Street Grille | This is the place to catch all the action. We’re eyeing the menu, and the buffalo chicken sandwich is calling our name. Pro tip: The Mount Pleasant location has a new kids’ patio. The Brick | It’s no surprise our readers love this tavern; while it’s a home base for Hokies and Brown fans, all fan bases are welcome. Home Team BBQ | We’re suprised this local favorite made the list, their gameday menu includes wings, various sandwiches, BBQ nachos, and pimento cheese. Is your mouth watering yet? Lamar’s | While this spot is Charleston’s first reservation-only nightlife experience, you can walk in to catch the game — just make a reservation for large parties. Lowcountry Sports Social | You’ll love the environment, with wall-to-wall TVs, drink discounts, and a great atmosphere for all football fans alike.",
