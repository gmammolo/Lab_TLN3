  "text": "Macroom battled back from three points down at the break to draw level with Douglas after 39 minutes in the Mardyke.\nThe Muskerry outfit had been impressive on the restart against the breeze, scoring four points without reply in the Premier 1 U16 Football Championship final.\nBut when Liam Cregan assisted Ben Herlihy for Douglas’ first score in the 41st minute, the momentum swung.\nCiarán Fitzgerald and Darragh O’Connor hit the target to restore Douglas’ three point lead after three quarters of an hour, but they only further improved.\nIan Butler and Diarmuid O’Donoghue shut down anything Macroom tried to create with superb performances in the half-back line, and Herlihy kicked another for the city side – 1-12 to 0-11.\nA defensive error after 51 minutes was punished by the Thomas Murray, the creator of Douglas’ first goal. He slotted home from close range, 2-12 to 0-11.\nThat killed Macroom’s hope of victory, but it didn’t stop Douglas from performing.\nJames Naughton and Herlihy added two more points, while Billy Murphy’s free for Macroom marked their first score in 18 minutes, as they trailed 2-14 to 0-12.\nThe teams traded before Murray netted a third Douglas goal deep into added time with a powerful strike, and they finished 11-point winners.\nThe eventual winners moved the ball well in the first quarter and took a 0-6 to 0-3 lead, with Murray getting two assists and Butler scoring two points from wing-back.\nThe quality of their passing made life difficult for Macroom, and Murray continued his flying start with another assist – this one resulting in a green flag.\nThe corner-forward cut in from the wing and kicked it across goal, and James Naughton arrived at the far post to palm it in, 1-6 to 0-3 after 18 minutes.\nMacroom improved after the goal as Ruairi O’Shea kicked his third point, his side’s second from play.\nBilly Murphy assisted Jack Leavy and was the provider again when Jack’s twin brother Sam Leavy split the posts, as their clever one-two from a 45 left just the goal between them, 1-6 to 0-6 after 22 minutes.\nMacroom’s half-forward line combined with O’Shea on target once again, but a free from Murray left it 1-7 to 0-7 at the break.\nMacroom were far better on the restart though and after Herlihy pointed for Douglas, their opponents went for goal.\nThey worked their way in and Coran Burns and struck it from point blank range, but Ryan Hourihan made a superb save for Douglas.\nMurphy hit two frees, and scores from the Leavy twins drew parity for Macroom, but they would end up being overpowered in the final 20 minutes.\nT Murray 2-4 (0-3 f), B Herlihy 0-5 (0-1 f), J Naughton 1-1, D O’Connor, I Butler 0-2 each, C Fitzgerald 0-1.\nR O’Shea 0-5 (0-1 f), B Murphy 0-4 f, J Leavy, S Leavy 0-2 each.\nR Hourihan; A Reidy, T Curtin, L O’Brien; L Cregan, D O’Donoghue, I Butler; S O’Súlleabhain, J Gordon; C Fitzgerald, D O’Connor, J Naughton; B Herlihy, A Kelly, T Murray.\nF O’Sullivan for O’Súlleabhain (36), N Duane for Gordon (46), J Coughlan for Reidy (55), S Lenihan for Naughton (59, inj).\nG Quinn; T Hopkins, C Neville, A Brophy; R Fitzgerald, E Healy, D Moss; J O’Shea, S Leavy; D Donovan, R O’Shea, J Leavy; B Murphy, C Burns, D Lucey.\nK O’Dwyer for Lucey (48), S Condon for O’Donovan (55), C Nash for Burns (58), J O’Sullivan for Moss (60+3).\nDiarmuid Kirwan (Éire Óg)",
