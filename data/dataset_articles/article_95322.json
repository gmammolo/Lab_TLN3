  "text": "Deion Sanders believes son Shedeur, Travis Hunter should have swept Week 1 awards [Travis Hunter](https://www.on3.com/db/travis-hunter-144752/) was the [Hornung National Player of the Week](https://cubuffs.com/news/2024/9/4/football-buffs-hunter-named-hornung-award-national-player-of-week) for his efforts in [Colorado](https://www.on3.com/college/colorado-buffaloes/)‘s win over South Dakota State in Week 1, while [Shedeur Sanders](https://www.on3.com/db/shedeur-sanders-107068/) was an honorable mention for the Davey O’Brien National Player of the Week. According to Coach Prime — they both should have swept the season-openinng awards.

Or the weekly award should have gone to those two guys. “But it’s almost like, ‘No, we can’t do that. Their coach is Deion Sanders, we can’t do that. I’m not gonna let him get away with that.” [Watch College Football Games Live -Try for Free Fubo! Click HERE NOW](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=5298464) Shedeur would finish the 31-26 victory having completed 26 of 34 passes for 445 yards, four touchdowns and an interception. Instead, [Miami](https://www.on3.com/teams/miami-hurricanes/)‘s [Cam Ward](https://www.on3.com/db/cam-ward-18163/) was given the Week 1 award for his part in defeating Florida in The Swamp on Saturday. For Hunter, he played all but two snaps for the Buffs over the weekend. He finished with seven catches for 132 yards and three touchdowns — including a game-winning catch in the endzone during the fourth quarter. He also logged three tackles on defense. Both logged strong performances during their season debut, and while it didn’t result in multiple player of the week honors — it’s clear that both Shedeur and Hunter have become elite at their position(s). “We see it after practice,” Coach Prime continued. “[Shedeur] stays after practice and works with his receivers. That’s why [Shedeur and Hunter] have impeccable time, and that’s why they know one another like no other. The kid works his butt off, and I’m proud. I’m proud that he’s displaying what I’ve seen ever since he was a kid.” To Deion Sanders, his son’s willingness to hold his teammates accountable while staying consistent on the field has impressed him the most. Shedeur and the Buffs will look to continue their winning ways on the road at [Nebraska](https://www.on3.com/teams/nebraska-cornhuskers/) this weekend. Kickoff for the Week 2 matchup is set for 7:30 p.m. ET live on NBC and Peacock.",
