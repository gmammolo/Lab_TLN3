  "text": "Nasos Gavelas achieved great success for Greece at the Paralympic Games by winning the gold medal in the 100 meters with a time of 11.02″. T11 piloted by Ioannis Nyfantopoulos who is the second for our country in Paris.\nThe athlete and his pilot, Giannis Nyfantopoulos, celebrated this great victory together.\nSee also: Paralympics: Unlikely Gavelas, “Gold” Also in Paris (Video)\nThe Paralympic gold medalist in his statements to ERT, after the great success, said that “I still haven’t understood it” and that it is “very beautiful and very heavy. It’s incredible to hear our national anthem in this stadium.” “When you have worked so hard you have nothing to fear,” he added, among other things.\n“Goodbye… I won’t talk about myself, I’ll talk about the people who helped me and one of them is this crazy guy who has been giving his life for two months now. Like with Mitsos, we put our heart and soul last year but he was injured. We came here to show who’s in charge in the 100 meters, we didn’t come to lose but to win.”\nWith tears in her eyes, she said: “Thank God blessed the gold medal to come. I can’t believe it. Two months with Giannis… I was in a difficult psychological situation, after Dimitris’ injury, no one can imagine how difficult it was. When everyone told me “ What happened to Gavela? Are you done? Can’t you run?” No boy . It’s not that I can’t run, it’s that I want a smile and people who believe in me more than twice to win.”\nHe added: “I’m not alone, Giannis is too. We ran to the end. He said to me ‘listen to me, I’ll run, if you want, fall and crawl, it hurts, you’ll graze yourself’. And I thought: ‘No man, it’s a shame. Don’t get killed, get killed at the finish line and beat them by three centimetres’ and that’s what happened”.\nYannis Nyfantopoulos said: “I am moved and happy for this boy, for the effort he made. I had a difficult task because the previous boys who were in my position had left a heavy legacy. All I wanted was for Nasos to cross the finish line first. I promised his father that I would make him scream and cry, as he asked. I hope I have done it and that he is happy for his son. And above all that Nassos enjoys it.”\n“We will burn it together,” Nassos Gavelas said to Yannis Anifandopoulos, adding “let me tell you, we will burn it. See you in Brussels at the Diamond League. Let’s go celebrate it there with Karalis and Tedoglou because they will not be alone at OAKA.”\n#Nasos #Gavelas #Paralympian #Gold #Bent #told #run",
