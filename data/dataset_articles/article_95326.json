  "text": "Betting Chiefs vs. Ravens player props: Why Patrick Mahomes will thrive through the air By Dylan Svoboda Published Sep. 5, 2024, 5:12 p.m. ET Patrick Mahomes is in for a big year throwing the ball. Jay Biggerstaff-USA TODAY Sports Gambling content 21+. The New York Post may receive an affiliate commission if you sign up through our links. Read our editorial standards for more information.\nPatrick Mahomes’ receiving corps is as good as it’s been in years.\nOver the offseason, Chiefs brass went out and signed wide receiver Marquise “Hollywood” Brown and drafted speedster Xavier Worthy with the No. 28 overall pick.\nAlthough Brown will miss the opener with a shoulder injury, Worthy’s presence alone will help Mahomes in the passing game in Thursday’s season opener against the Ravens.\nMahomes had perhaps the worst season of his career in 2023 in the passing department with a career-high 14 interceptions, a career-worst 7.0 yards per attempt and a 92.6 passer rating.\nVegas oddsmakers are expecting some improvement with his new weapons this season, though, pegging Mahomes as the favorite to lead the NFL in passing yards.\nExplore More Fanatics Sportsbook Promo: Earn $1K in bonus bets with daily bet match for Ravens vs. Chiefs, any game Ravens vs. Chiefs same-game parlay: NFL Kickoff game picks, player props, odds Chiefs vs. Ravens predictions, odds: Two prop picks for Thursday’s 2024 NFL season opener Patrick Mahomes #15 of the Kansas City Chiefs looks for an open receiver during the first quarter of a preseason game against the Detroit Lions at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on August 17, 2024 in Kansas City, Missouri. Getty Images\nHe’ll get his first licks against the Ravens in Kansas City, where his passing yards over/under are sitting at 267.5 at BetRivers Sportsbook hours before kickoff.\nMahomes went over this number in half of his games (10/20) last season, including the Chiefs’ playoff run.\nBut from 2018-23, Mahomes had no problem clearing 267.5 passing yards on a regular basis, throwing for 268+ in nearly two-thirds (63.1 percent) during the regular season over that period.",
