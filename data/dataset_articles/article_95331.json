  "text": "Richard Carapaz continues his fight to reach the podium at La Vuelta a España.\nRichard Carapaz continues to fight to climb the general classification of La Vuelta a España. On this occasion he finished seventh in Stage 15, which took place in the morning (Ecuador time) of this September 1, 2024.\nThe Ecuadorian made a great effort in this mountain race, whose last part was a “hellish” climb. Thanks to the work of Carapaz he managed to shave off a few seconds and continues in the fight to climb onto the podium of the cycling race that will see the last week of competition.\n“I think we’re still in the fight, we have a good rest day ahead and, well, more stages are coming,” Carapaz said after the race.\nWhat position is Richard Carapaz in? The Ecuadorian cyclist remains in fourth place overall in the Vuelta a España, with six stages to go.\nThis is the classification:\nPosition Cyclist Time 1 Ben O’Connor 60h 20′ 05» 2 Primoz Roglic 60h 21′ 45» 3 Enrico Mas 60h 21′ 45» 4 Richard Carapaz 60h 22′ 06»",
