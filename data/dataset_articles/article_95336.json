  "text": "Noah Gray signing three-year, $18 million extension with Chiefs [Noah Gray](https://www.on3.com/db/noah-gray-93614/) will sign a new contract with the Kansas City Chiefs ahead of the team’s season-opener against the Baltimore Ravens. [According to Adam Schefter of ESPN,](https://x.com/AdamSchefter/status/1831789049121755596) the veteran tight end is signing a three-year, $18 million contract extension that includes $10.1 million fully guaranteed at signing. The Chiefs selected Gray in the fifth round of the 2021 NFL Draft, and he’s the top backup tight end behind [Travis Kelce](https://www.on3.com/db/travis-kelce-114609/). In 17 regular season games with 10 starts in 2023, Gray caught 28 passes for 305 yards and two touchdowns.

While Kelce was being interviewed on the sidelines, he praised the [Duke Blue Devils](https://www.on3.com/college/duke-blue-devils/) alum for multi-tasking. “Obviously, Noah doing it all and even today getting in a few long snaps,” Kelce said, [per Yahoo Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/chiefs-travis-kelce-praises-noah-155739012.html). “I don’t even think I’ve seen him long-snap before in my life. And he goes in there and he gets two punts off and a field goal from about 40 yards.” [Watch NFL Games Live -Try for Free Fubo!

And he’s an excellent mentor. I mean, he’s an even better friend, too. So watching him out here [and] picking his brain is always good. But you know, Travis Kelce [is] Travis Kelce, for a reason. I’m just trying to do my job to the best of my ability and, you know, not try to do too much more than that.” Gray added: “He’s just very intelligent and knowledgeable, and he’s been in the league for 10-plus years. “So, a guy like that sees the defenses differently, and it’s just really cool to see him talk through how he looks at defenses and safeties and corners and what he’s thinking, you know, mid-route, so, you know, getting the firsthand take of that every day in a meeting room. You know, it’s been absolutely incredible the past three years.”",
