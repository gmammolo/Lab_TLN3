  "text": "[Sports](https://www.ripplesnigeria.com/sports/) Full house in Super Eagles camp as Osimhen arrives Uyo for AFCONQ All invited players have arrived the Super Eagles camp ahead of their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers this weekend. The last player to join the team was Napoli striker Victor Osimhen, who arrived the team’s Four Points by Sheraton hotel base on Thursday. Osimhen, 25, had been in Turkey where he was completing his loan move to Galatasaray following his inability to get a favourable transfer deal.

Caretaker coach Augustine Eguavoen now has the full compliment of all 23 invited players in camp. The Super Eagles will hold their final training session ahead of the game on Friday.
