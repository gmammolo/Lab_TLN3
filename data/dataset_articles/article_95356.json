  "text": "In the second round, Djokovic met another Serbian, Laszlo Jeri (ATP 109). With the score 6-4, 6-4, 2-0 in favor of Djokovic, Jere retired due to injury.\nIn the second set Jere was leading 4-2, but at that point he started having hip problems.\n“With each round the matches will become more and more difficult, I am well aware of that and I accept it. I will find a solution, as I have done many times in my career,” Djokovic said.\nATP number four Alexander Zverev from Germany also advanced to the second round in a three-set match, winning 6-4, 7-6 (7:5), 6-1 over French tennis player Alexander Miller (ATP 77).\nEighth-ranked Kasper Ruud also reached the third round, beating Frenchman Gael Monfils (ATP 45) 6-4, 6-2, 2-6, 7-6 (7:3). Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, ninth seed, defeated Australian Rinki Hidzhikat (ATP 62) 6-1, 6-1, 7-6 (7:4).\nThe battle for the third round proved much tougher for world number six Andrei Rublyov of Russia, who prevailed over Frenchman Artur Rinderknech (ATP 56) in a five-set match 4-6, 5-7, 6-1. 6-2, 6-2.\nThe US Open Championship, the last Grand Slam tournament of the season, will take place until September 8.\n#Opponent #withdraws #due #injury #Djokovic #advances\n2024-09-05 15:51:05",
