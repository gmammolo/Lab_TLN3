  "text": "Clemson unveils new basketball court inside Littlejohn Coliseum The [Clemson Tigers](https://www.on3.com/college/clemson-tigers/) had a magical run on the basketball court last March, reaching the Elite Eight for the first time since 1980. While they fell just short of a Final Four appearance, falling to Alabama 89-82, the Tigers’ historic run helped to kick up the enthusiasm and excitement surrounding their program. On Thursday morning, Clemson unveiled a brand-new basketball court for their fans and players to enjoy this season. Clemson basketball outlook for 2024-2025 Like many other teams across the country, the Clemson basketball roster will have an entirely new look in the 2024-2025 season. Former Tigers big man PJ Hall went undrafted in the 2024 NBA Draft, but eventually signed with the Denver Nuggets. The good news is Clemson returns one of their most important pieces, forward [Ian Schieffelin](https://www.on3.com/db/ian-schieffelin-48839/). He averaged 10.1 points, 9.4 rebounds, and 2.2 assists per game last year for the Tigers, playing a critical role in fueling their historic run to the Elite Eight.

In Clemson’s first round matchup in the NCAA Tournament against [New Mexico](https://www.on3.com/college/new-mexico-lobos/), “Schieffelin stuffed the stat sheet with 16 points and 12 rebounds in their blowout victory. He followed that up with solid showings against Baylor in the Round of 32 (11 points and six rebounds) and Arizona in the Sweet 16 (14 points and seven rebounds). To finish it off, he stuffed the stat sheet with a double-double in Clemson’s 89-82 loss to Alabama in the Elight Eight (18 points, 11 rebounds, and two assists). His return was massive for the Tigers’ 2024-2025 season, and he’ll once again be a critical player for their front court. He’ll be joined by Boston College transfer [Jaeden Zackery](https://www.on3.com/db/jaeden-zackery-162840/), who was quietly one of the more talented guards in the ACC last season. He put up pretty complete numbers last year, pumping in 11.3 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 4.2 assists for the Eagles. Zackery also shot 40.5% from three-point range. In the front court, Clemson went out and landed a high-level contributor at the power forward position, Illinois State transfer [Myles Foster](https://www.on3.com/db/myles-foster-178751/). He averaged 12.4 points per game and 8.1 rebounds per game last year for the Redbirds. He’ll help to replace some of the front court production vacated by [PJ Hall](https://www.on3.com/db/pj-hall-94868/). Clemson also plucked big man [Christian Reeves](https://www.on3.com/db/christian-reeves-23126/) from the Duke Blue Devils. He’s listed at 7-1, 261 pounds and joined the Tigers in the hopes of logging more minutes. He only averaged five minutes per game and 3.2 minutes per game in his first two seasons on the Blue Devils’ loaded roster. In the 2021-2022 season for Oak Hill Academy, Reeves averaged 9.2 points, while bringing in 7.4 rebounds. He chose Duke over Minnesota, South Carolina, and others. Those are just a few of the reasons for Clemson fans to get excited about the 2024-2025 campaign. It’ll be tough for the Tigers to top their magical run in the NCAA Tournament from this past year, but the pieces they’ve brought in this offseason should at least make them very competitive in the ACC.",
