  "text": "Super Eagles striker Victor Osimhen has finally reported for international duty in Uyo, becoming the last player to join the squad ahead of Nigeria’s 2025 AFCON qualifier against Benin Republic. Osimhen, who is on loan from Napoli to Galatasaray, joined his teammates on Thursday. His arrival was met with smiles and cheers from team officials, as the star forward was given extra time to finalize his season-long loan deal after a hectic transfer window. The 25-year-old striker had been linked to major European clubs such as PSG, Chelsea, and Al Ahli throughout the summer, but those moves failed to happen before the transfer window closed on August 30. Now that he has joined the national team, Osimhen will prepare with the Super Eagles under interim manager Austin Eguavoen for the important qualifier against Benin Republic. The team began their training on Tuesday, September 3, and Osimhen’s return is expected to be a significant boost. The Super Eagles have struggled recently, winning just one of their last four matches without Osimhen. The star forward last played for Nigeria during their run to the 2023 AFCON final against Ivory Coast in Abidjan. He missed friendly matches in March and was absent for the June 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. The Super Eagles will face Benin Republic on Saturday, September 7, at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium. They will then take on Rwanda on Tuesday, September 10, at the Amahoro Stadium.",
