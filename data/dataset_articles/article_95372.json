  "text": "The Peruvian parataekwondo player wins her second consecutive Paralympic title, writing a new page in the history of the national sport. Angelica Espinoza He made history by becoming a two-time champion Paralympics at the Paris 2024 Games . The national parataekwondo player, who had already won the gold medal at Tokyo 2020, reaffirmed her dominance in the sport by once again achieving glory in the K44 (-47kg) category.\nAugust 29, 2024 will be an unforgettable date for Angélica and for Peruvian sports. Her victory not only gave her a new gold medal, but also placed her on the same level as legendary paraswimmer Jimmy Eulert, who had achieved the same feat at the Atlanta and Sydney 2000 Games in 1996.\nOn her way to the final, Espinoza showed an undeniable superiority. In her first match, she defeated Cameroonian Guileine Chemogne with a resounding score of 28-9, which took her to the quarterfinals. There, she authoritatively defeated Iranian Maryam Abdollahpour 19-9, securing a place in the semifinals.\nRead also:\nPeruvian Para-athletes set out for Paris 2024 in pursuit of Paralympic medals\nThe semifinal was not played because her opponent, Naoual Laarif of Morocco, was unable to appear due to injury. This allowed Angelica to advance directly to the final, where she faced Ziyodakhon Isakova of Uzbekistan. In an exceptional performance, Espinoza won 10-4, thus obtaining her second gold medal at the Paralympics.\nAngélica, who began her career in parataekwondo in 2017 and won her first gold medal at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, has shown that there are no limits for those who pursue their dreams with determination and passion.\nIn addition to Espinoza’s feat, other Peruvian paraathletes also achieved outstanding performances at Paris 2024. Paraswimmer Rodrigo Santillán earned a Paralympic diploma by finishing sixth in the S2 100-meter backstroke final. For their part, Daniella Campos, in paraarch, and Rubí Fernández, in parabadminton, also competed, but were unable to advance to the next rounds.\n#Angélica #Espinoza #Twotime #Paralympic #Champion #Paris\n2024-09-05 15:59:05",
