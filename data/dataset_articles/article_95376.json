  "text": "Nigerian defender, Olisa Ndah, who currently plays for South African club Orlando Pirates, has expressed his openness to making a move to Europe. The 26-year-old centre-back has been a key player for Orlando since joining from Akwa United, a team in the Nigeria Professional Football League, in 2021. Ndah has helped his team win the MTN 8 League Cup in two consecutive seasons at the Orlando Stadium in Soweto. Despite his strong individual performances and consistency, a rumored transfer to Italian club Sassuolo never materialized as no official bid was made. However, Ndah remains optimistic about a potential move to Europe. He emphasized his satisfaction with his current role at Orlando Pirates but admitted he is open to new opportunities should they arise. “I’m happy where I am, but I’m open to any opportunity that comes my way,” Ndah told Goal in an interview. Ndah began his professional career in the Nigeria Professional Football League with Remo Stars during the 2018/2019 season. After 18 months, he joined Akwa United, where he won the league title. Since 2021, Ndah has been playing in South Africa with Orlando Pirates and continues to aim for a future move to Europe.",
