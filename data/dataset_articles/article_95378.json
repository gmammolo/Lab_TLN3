  "text": "August couldn’t have gone much better than it did for [Liverpool](https://liverpooloffside.sbnation.com/). The Reds recorded a perfect 3-0-0 record to start the Premier League season, playing impressive football under new head coach Arne Slot and sweeping aside Ipswich, Brentford, and [Manchester United](https://thebusbybabe.sbnation.com) by a combined score of 7-0. Meanwhile, superstar forward Mohamed Salah showed no signs of slowing down as he began his eighth season as a Red, with the player involved in six of those Liverpool goals to the tune of three goals and three assists in 263 minutes of action, adding an individually great month to the team’s success. It’s no surprise, then, that the duo are up for Premier League Player of the Month and Manager of the Month, and Salah and Slot could both end up winners. Salah is up against Bryan Mbeumo, Amadou Onana, Cole Palmer, David Raya, Bukayo Saka, Danny Welbeck, and likely co-favourite Erling Haaland. Voting for Salah is open to fans on the Premier League’s website [here](https://www.premierleague.com/news/4106380). In the manager category, Slot is competing with Arsenal’s Mikel Arteta, Man City’s Pep Guardiola, and new Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler. Voting for Slot is open to fans on the Premier League’s website [here](https://www.premierleague.com/news/4106384).",
