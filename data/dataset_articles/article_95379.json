  "text": "A grudge match between Bayley and Tiffany Stratton will go down on SmackDown this Friday night. WWE announced the matchup this afternoon in a video posted by SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis. Last week, Bayley returned to WWE programming for the first time since losing the WWE Women’s Championship to Nia Jax at SummerSlam. Stratton — who holds the women’s Money in the Bank briefcase — distracted Bayley during that match. Bayley then made her return on last Friday’s SmackDown from Berlin, helping Michin even the odds after Stratton got involved in a Jax vs. Michin street fight for the WWE Women’s Championship. Jax still retained her title despite Bayley chasing Stratton away. Rogers Place in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada is the venue for SmackDown this Friday. It’s the last episode of the show that will air on Fox before SmackDown moves to USA Network starting on September 13. The updated card is listed below: WWE SmackDown (Friday, September 6) — - Cody Rhodes responds to Solo Sikoa’s Undisputed WWE Championship challenge - Eight-man tag match: Angelo Dawkins, Montez Ford, Johnny Gargano & Tommaso Ciampa vs. The Bloodline (Solo Sikoa, Tama Tonga, Tonga Loa & Jacob Fatu) - Bayley vs. Tiffany Stratton - Giovanni Vinci returns",
