  "text": "Five-star guard Jasper Johnson officially announced his intention to play for Mark Pope and the Kentucky Wildcats Thursday.\nJohnson made the announcement in a live stream carried by 247Sports and CBS Sports. The 6-foot-5 shooting guard from Atlanta’s Overtime Elite chose Kentucky over offers from Alabama and North Carolina. He is ranked the No. 12 player in the class of 2025 by both On3 and 247Sports.\n“Coach Pope, I feel like he made a big commitment, took a lot of time and spoke a lot with me, so I feel like the trust was there between me and him and the coaching staff,” Johnson said at the live event where he announced his commitment. “Being from Lexington, Kentucky, I feel like that was an easy decision. I feel like I’m K.Y. till I die.”\nWith his commitment, Johnson becomes the second player in the 2025 recruiting class to commit to the Wildcats. Malachi Moreno , a four-star center from Great Crossing High School in Georgetown (Ky.), committed to Kentucky back on Aug. 16.\nJohnson is the son of former Kentucky football player Dennis Johnson, a defensive end who played for the Wildcats from 1998-2001 and was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in the 2002 NFL Draft.\nFollow us @UKWildcatsWire on X and on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Kentucky Wildcats news, notes and opinions.",
