  "text": "Aurélie Rivard overcomes demons for gold medal in women’s 400-metre freestyle Tess Routliffe adds bronze as Canadian Para swimmers hit 10-medal mark Tess Routliffe adds bronze as Canadian Para swimmers hit 10-medal mark PARIS – On Thursday night at the 2024 Paralympic Games, Aurélie Rivard put behind a dark incident from the past and showed why she is one of the greatest Para athletes of all time with a golden performance in the women’s S10 400-metre freestyle. For Rivard, the 400-metre freestyle is the most important races in her repertoire. She’s the world record holder in the event; the first medal she won at the Games, back in 2012 at age 16, was a silver in the 400. That launched a superstar career that now stands at 13 Paralympic Games medals and 19 more at the world championships. She’s now won the 400 free at three straight Games. “It’s the race that defines me.” Rivard clocked 4:29.20 for the victory with Alexandra Truwit of the U.S. second in 4:31.39 and Bianka Pap of Hungary, the two-time reigning world champion, third in 4:36.63. But Thursday’s race was much more than padding her impressive record. It was about chasing demons and reclaiming her status as the world’s top racer in the event. ‘’The 400 is the race that’s made me suffer the most in the last few years, both physically and mentally,’’ said the 28-year-old from St-Jean-sur Richelieu, Que. ‘’I literally had to relearn how to swim it and really show up on the blocks without the fear of dying in the middle of it.’’ Rivard’s nervousness in the 400 emanates from her showing at the 2022 World Championships in Madeira, Portugal. In that 400 final, Rivard shockingly stopped late in the race. She was gassed. At the world championships last year, she qualified in the prelims but withdrew from the 400 final due to a fear of a Madeira repeat. These incidents did not sit well for Rivard and also served as her biggest challenge to overcome in Paris. On Thursday, Rivard marched onto the pool deck like she owned La Defense Arena. She started strong clocking first at the 50-metre split. Then nail biting time started. She dropped to second and by 200-metres she was third. This time however, instead of fading, Rivard shifted to another level and by the time she touched the finish she was a full body length up on Truwit. When she realized her victory, the usually reserved Rivard smashed the water with her fist. The demons were dead. ‘’I knew my strength was in the second half and that’s where I kept my focus and brought it,’’ she said. ‘’It went well.’’ It was Rivard’s third medal and first gold at Paris 2024. She now has a complete medal set for a second straight Games. She won silver on Sunday in the 100 freestyle and bronze last Thursday in the 50 free. She is the first Canadian swimmer since Stephanie Dixon in 2008 to win Para swimming gold in three straight Games. ‘’This is going to be one of my most special medals,’’ said Rivard. ‘’I know how hard I fought to get this one. But is it more special than the first one, I don’t know, but it’s going to be up there for sure.’’ Just a half-hour before Rivard’s final, Tess Routliffe of Caledon, Ont. took bronze in the women’s SB7 100-m breaststroke. Mariia Pavlova of the Neutral Paralympic Team broke the world record for the win in 1:26.09. Iona Winnfrith of Great Britain was second in 1:29.69 and Routliffe followed in 1:31.58. It was Routliffe’s second medal of the Games after a silver in the 200 IM earlier this week. ‘’I came here to race and that’s exactly what I did,’’ said Routliffe. ‘’I felt I was more aggressive in the final. I tried to stick with the leaders but they came back really strong.’’ Canadian Para swimmers have won 10 medals in Paris (three gold, four silver, three bronze). That betters the total Canada won three years ago at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics (three gold, three silver, two bronze). Also on Thursday, Mary Jibb of Bracebridge, Ont. was seventh in the women’s SM9 200-metre individual medley. \"*\" indicates required fields",
