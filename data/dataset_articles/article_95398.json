  "text": "Australian long-jumper Vanessa Low shatters world record in Paris Paralympics triumph Australian long-jumper Vanessa Low has completed a Paralympic threepeat, winning gold at Stade de France on Friday morning AEST. The 34-year-old, who also took home gold at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020, jumped 5.45m in the women’s long jump T63 competition to topple her own world record of 5.33m, achieve in Canberra earlier this year. Her closest competitor, silver medallist Martina Carboni of Italy, recorded a best distance of 5.06m, while Switzerland’s Elena Kratter claimed bronze. “I love putting myself on the big stage, and I think I can jump six metres,” Low said. “I think this is my next big goal, six is possible, I want to break down barriers. “When I first picked up the sport we were at 4.5m and now we are all pushing boundaries.” Elsewhere in Paris, Australian swimmer Tim Hodge won his first individual Paralympic gold medal after placing first in the men’s 200m individual medley SM9 final with a time 2:13.31. The 23-year-old, who also won gold in the mixed 4x100m medley relay 34 Points earlier this week, toppled the Paralympic record that was set by fellow Australian Matthew Cowdrey in 2008. Frence duo Ugo Didier and Hector Denayer joined Hodge on the podium. “When I told that to my parents they were adamant, no, we’ll find something that I was good at,” Hodge said. “It was something they worked their whole lives to give me the best opportunities and find what I was good at. “I am extremely proud to say that all the hard times and everything was worth it.” Before arriving in the French capital, Hodge had two Paralympic silver medals and a bronze to his name, each achieved in Tokyo three years ago.",
