  "text": "The Tracy High girls volleyball team threw everything but the kitchen sink at the Ripon High Indians in order to avoid the sweep in their non-league clash Wednesday night.\nRiding a hot four-game win streak into the match, the Bulldogs (6-4) wanted to keep the wave going. However, their visitors had other ideas. The Indians (10-1) looked too strong and too clinical at the net from start to finish and they were able to see out their 3-0 victory down the stretch.\n“I thought we played well against a strong opponent,” Tracy head coach Cat Ebojo said afterwards. “Ripon is offensively tough and defensively sound. Some of our players are club teammates with theirs so they have a lot of respect for them, and we knew what we were up against.”\nThe hosts grew into the game gradually. They started every set slowly but the ‘Dogs were able to put up a fight all the way through — especially in the third and final frame.\nAfter dropping the first set 25-18 and the second 25-19, the Bulldogs were staring down the barrel of a pretty straight-forward sweep. However, they were not down and out, and a late flurry — despite trailing 21-15 — proved that.\nLed by sophomore setter Alyssa Rupisan, who had 16 assists, two kills, and four aces on the night, the hosts ended the game on a 6-4 run. It only delayed the inevitable in the end — but it was certainly something to build on moving forward. Ripon won the closing set 25-21.\n“We are a young varsity squad who relies heavily on our athleticism and chemistry to compete against more experienced teams,” Ebojo added. “Despite the loss, I feel like we competed well and improved with each set.\n“In the first two sets, we just couldn’t get our offense going. However, in the last set, we picked it up as our pins combined for 12 kills and also served tougher.”\nJunior Gaby Hernandez spearheaded the Tracy attack with 10 kills, two blocks, one ace, two assists, and five digs. Sophomore Jolie Lam added 5 kills, one block, and one ace. Junior Addison Van Os got all three of her kills late in the third set to keep the ‘Dogs alive.\nRupisan was at the heart of everything. Overall, Tracy’s offense struggled against the tall, long block of Ripon. The visitors were able to get their hands on a lot of the Bulldogs’ approaches at the net — making their defense’s job significantly easier.\nTracy’s finishing percentage was low on the night. They lacked a bit of aggressiveness to use the Ripon block to their advantage. However, the connection between Rupisan and Hernandez that blossomed throughout the game is a big positive to take away from the tough defeat.\nThe Bulldogs threatened to extend the match beyond the third set midway through the frame when a 6-0 run made it 13-13 behind back-to-back aces from junior Pilar Zuniga and a strong kill from Hernandez.\nHowever, the Indians were in a winning mood, and once a service error from Zuniga gave them a break, they pounced and erupted for an 8-2 run to virtually pull away for good.\nTracy’s ability to go on a few convincing runs of their own, though, showed that they were making the right adjustments. Ebojo looked visibly frustrated when she was forced into a timeout with her team down 18-12 in the second set.\nA smile appeared on Ebojo’s face a lot more from that point onwards as her team dug deep and refused to roll over. They also started to execute their plays a lot better. Some of the hosts’ imperfections could be down to fatigue as this game was their eighth in the last six days.\n“We’ve played a tough schedule since last weekend, facing many high-ranked teams in the section such as Pleasant Grove, Manteca, Vista del Lago, and now Ripon,” Ebojo said. “This has been instrumental in growing our confidence.”\nRipon was led by towering hitter Adriana Dorn. The visitors’ No. 11 looked unstoppable at times — pulling off finishes from every angle and manipulating the Bulldogs’ blocks to near perfection.\nDorn found her groove very early as Ripon climbed out to a quick 5-0 lead in the opening frame. They then led 17-12 before seeing out the first with relative comfort, 25-18.\nDespite the loss, a test against a team as good as Ripon at this point of the campaign could prove invaluable for the Bulldogs come the business end of the season.\nThe problems that Ebojo identified in her team’s game are good to have in non-league play as they can all be ironed out by the time Tri-City Athletic League (TCAL) kicks off for the Bulldogs when they host West High on Sept. 19.\nLast time out, the Bulldogs took out Manteca 3-0 on their home floor Tuesday night. Over the long weekend, Tracy competed at the Folsom Bulldog Bash tournament where they became the Bronze Champions with a 3-2 record.\nMountain House 3, West 0\nThe Mustangs improved to 3-1 in the early season on Tuesday when they took down the Wolf Pack in a sweep – handing West their third straight loss to drop them to 2-4.\nFor Mountain House, it was a bounce back win after falling to Tracy 3-1 on the road last week. Also away from home, the Mustangs beat West 25-15, 25-15, 25-18 in sets.\nThe visitors were led by senior Addison Turner with 8 kills and three aces. Junior Jaziz Gomez added 5 kills, six aces, and two blocks. Junior Jenna Starks chipped in with 6 kills and two aces. Senior Nayeli Pleskac had 15 assists and a pair of aces.\nOn a slow offensive night, West received contributions from Alissa Klimek who had one kill, one block, and five digs. Xienna Cardona-Renshaw added one kill, one ace, and four digs. McKenna Adamo hit two aces and had three digs.\nThe ‘Stangs have since dropped to 3-2 on their season after losing 3-0 to Lathrop on Wednesday night at home.\nContact Arion Armeniakos at , or call 209-830-4229.",
