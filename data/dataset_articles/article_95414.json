  "text": "Arsenal have received two nominations for Player of the Month and one for Manager of the Month from the Premier League in August. Arsenal’s Spanish manager Mikel Arteta gestures on the touchline during the English Premier League football match between Aston Villa and Arsenal at Villa Park in Birmingham, central England on August 24, 2024. (Photo by ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP via Getty Images) With August coming to an end, the Premier League have revealed their nominees for Manager and Player of the Month.\nArsenal’s Mikel Arteta is up for the Manager of the Month award, joining Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola, Brighton’s Fabian Hurzeler, and Liverpool’s Arne Slot in the running.\nAll four managers went unbeaten in August, with Arteta and Hurzeler facing off in a draw at the end of the month.\nLiverpool’s Slot had a great start, but it’s worth noting that his win over Manchester United came after the month ended. Only his first two victories count towards this award.\nWith that in mind, Guardiola is probably the favourite, given City’s three wins in three games.\nLONDON, ENGLAND: David Raya of Arsenal warms up prior to the pre-season friendly match between Arsenal and Olympique Lyonnais at Emirates Stadium on August 11, 2024. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images) As for the Player of the Month award, Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka and David Raya join Manchester City’s Erling Haaland, Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, Aston Villa’s Amadou Onana, Chelsea’s Cole Palmer, Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah, and Brighton’s Danny Welbeck.\nAgain, Manchester City probably have the favourite here, with Haaland having scored seven goals in three games.\nGoalkeepers rarely win these awards, but Raya had a fantastic month, keeping two clean sheets and winning 10-man Arsenal a point against Brighton. He made vital saves in all three matches to ensure the Gunners started the new season in strong form.\nSaka earned his nomination by providing assists in all three matches, as well as scoring against Wolves. Only Haaland beat his four goal contributions in August.\nLONDON, ENGLAND: Bukayo Saka of Arsenal celebrates scoring his team’s second goal during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Wolverhampton Wanderers FC at Emirates Stadium on August 17, 2024. (Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images) Arteta continues to keep Arsenal on track fighting at the top of the table in 2024/25, but Raya and Saka played a big role in the Gunners’ unbeaten start to the campaign. All three earned their nominations in August.",
