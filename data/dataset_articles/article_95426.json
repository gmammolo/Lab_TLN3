  "text": "HOW AUSTRALIA FARED ON DAY EIGHT OF THE 2024 PARIS PARALYMPICS:\nGOLD\nLauren Parker (cycling, women's H1-4 road race) - Fresh off her time trial silver and triathlon gold, the uber-impressive Parker smashed the field and won the road race by more than four minutes. The 35-year-old is the biggest success story of Australia's 2024 Paris campaign.\nTim Hodge (swimming, men's S9 200m individual medley) - Hodge was part of Australia's relay team which won gold earlier in the Games but he had placed just outside the medal spots in three individual races. This was the 23-year-old's first individual gold of his career.\nVanessa Low (athletics, T61 long jump) - Low spoke of wanting to break down barriers and more records after scoring a world record 5.45m on her first jump of the day. The German-born 34-year-old has now won two golds for Australia and one for her country of birth.\nSILVER\nNone.\nBRONZE\nSamuel Von Einem (table tennis, men's singles class 11) - A third-straight Paralympic medal for the 29-year-old, who won silvers at Tokyo and Rio. Von Einem lost his semi-final 3-1 to South Korean Kim Gi Tae.\nWHAT ELSE HAPPENED\n*Athletics - T53 wheelchair racer Catherine Debrunner is emerging as the closest threat to Madison de Rozario's marathon defence. The Swiss won the 400m race on Thursday adding to golds in the 800m, 1500m, 5000m and a silver in the 100m\n* Athletics - Australia's Jackson Hamilton placed sixth in the men's javelin F13 with an area record of 59.20m. Britain's Daniel Pembroke won gold, smashing the world record twice with throws of 71.01m and 74.49m.\n*Archery - Australian duo Taymon Keaton-Smith and Amanda Jennings fell at the first hurdle, losing 5-4 in their first-round mixed team recurve event to India.\n*Swimming - What were you doing at 13? Well British 13-year-old Iona Winnifrith won silver in the final of the women's SB7 100m breaststroke. Winnifrith only turned 13 in April.\nWHO SAID WHAT?\n\"I think you need more people with first-hand experience making, being part of those conversations, former athletes, former coaches\" - Australian co-captain Angie Ballard leaves organisers of Brisbane 2032 with food for thought after voicing concerns about the Paris Games organisation.\nMEDAL TABLE (after day eight)\n1. China - Gold: 74, Silver: 55, Bronze 37. Total: 166.\n2. Great Britain - Gold: 36, Silver: 29, Bronze 19. Total: 84.\n3. USA - Gold: 27, Silver: 33, Bronze 17. Total: 77.\n4. Netherlands - Gold: 21, Silver: 10, Bronze 5. Total: 36.\n**\n9. Australia - Gold: 14, Silver: 12, Bronze 19. Total: 45.",
