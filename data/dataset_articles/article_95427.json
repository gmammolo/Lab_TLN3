  "text": "The UEFA Nations League has returned in style with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring his 900th senior goal while San Marino achieved their first competitive win.\nRonaldo struck 34 minutes into Portugal's match with Croatia, giving his team a 2-0 lead. The 39-year-old was emotional after reaching the milestone in Lisbon, converting Nuno Mendes's cross.\nThe strike, Ronaldo's first since June, extended his record haul of international goals to 131.\nDiogo Dalot, who had scored Portugal's first, then conceded an own goal to give Croatia a way back into the game but Ronaldo's goal proved the difference in a 2-1 win.\nIn Serravalle, San Marino conceded first against Liechtenstein, themselves on a 40-match winless streak, but the goal was ruled out by the VAR (Video Assistant Referee).\nEight minutes into the second half Nicko Sensoli scored and San Marino, a small enclave in Italy, held on to win 1-0.\nIt was their first win since beating the same opposition in a friendly two decades and 140 matches ago, and only their second ever.\nSan Marino has a population of 33,000 and covers 61 sq km. Ranked 210th in the world they had lost 196 of their previous 205 matches.\nPrior to this their main claim to fame was scoring after eight seconds in a World Cup qualifier against England in 1993, eventually losing 7-1. It is the second-fastest goal in World Cup qualification history.\nElsewhere Poland let slip a 2-0 lead away to Scotland, but clinched the points with a 97th-minute penalty to win 3-2, Spain were held to a goalless draw by Serbia and Denmark beat a Swiss team reduced to nine after Nico Elvedi and Granit Xhaka were sent off 2-0.\nThere were also wins for Northern Ireland, 2-0 against Luxembourg, Sweden, 3-1 in Azerbaijan where Newcastle striker Alexander Isak scored twice, and Slovakia, 1-0 in Estonia.\nBelarus and Bulgaria drew 0-0.\nwith agencies",
