The video also features a brief clip of Usher performing at the Super Bowl half-time show at Allegiant Stadium. Travis, 34, has actually become one of the most talked-about athletes in the world since he began dating Taylor, and Patrick Mahomes - Travis' teammate - previously claimed that the pop star has helped to make the Kansas City Chiefs a \"worldwide team\". Speaking to Time magazine, he explained: \"[The Chiefs] went from a nationwide team that was kind of global to a full global worldwide team. That came from Taylor's fanbase.\" Patrick also admitted to being impressed by Taylor's down-to-earth attitude and her work ethic, explaining that she's always \"working on something\". The sports star - who is one of the best players in the NFL - said: \"I've met a lot of famous people now in my life. Taylor's probably the most down-to-earth person that's been on that stage for that long. \"She's never not working. Even when she's taking her downtime, she's working on something. Shooting a music video or singing a song or writing a song. You can see it by how she talks.\" >> More Entertainment News © 2024 Bang Showbiz, NZCity Other Entertainment News 06 Sep: Holland Taylor and Sarah Paulson think about people \"in the same way\" 06 Sep: Kristin Cavallari's 12-year-old son \"wants to be on social media\" 06 Sep: What we know about the remaining Israeli hostages taken by Hamas to Gaza 06 Sep: Ashley Park loved working with Meryl Streep on 'Only Murders in the Building' 06 Sep: Sir Elton John has been left with limited vision in one eye after battling a \"severe eye infection\" 06 Sep: Angelina Jolie has embraced being an \"older woman\" 05 Sep: Lucien Laviscount feels inspired by Shakira Top Stories RUGBY Confidence that Wallace Sititi has what it takes in a crucial rematch with the All Blacks oldest foe More...
