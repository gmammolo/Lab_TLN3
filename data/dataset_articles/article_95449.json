  "text": "116 3rd St SE Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52401 Subscriber Services Our Journalists Sports Desk Our Columnists Our Writers Our Writers Our Photojournalists Data More Gazette Other Links [Home](https://www.thegazette.com/) / [Sports](https://www.thegazette.com/sports/) / [Minor League Sports](https://www.thegazette.com/minor-league-sports/) The outfielder, shortstop end this minor league baseball season as teammates in the Midwest League Sep. 5, 2024 1:45 pm CEDAR RAPIDS — They’re sharing an apartment for the final week of the Midwest League regular season. Which is only fitting. It’d be beyond cool for fans of the Minnesota Twins to see [Walker Jenkins](https://www.milb.com/player/walker-jenkins-805805) and [Kaelen Culpepper](https://www.milb.com/player/kaelen-culpepper-701785?season=2024&team=492) progress together through the minor leagues. Perhaps reach the big leagues at the same time. Jenkins was Minnesota’s first-round draft pick last year, Culpepper its first-rounder this year. They are teammates (and roommates) with the [Cedar Rapids Kernels](https://www.thegazette.com/cedar-rapids-kernels/) at the end of this season, and most likely will be Kernels teammates to begin next season. “I think not only would it be great (for ourselves), because I think we would help program some wins whatever team we’re on,” Jenkins said of developing together. “But I think we’re going to push each other. He’s a competitor, I’m a competitor. We’re going to go out and I would say hold each other accountable and make each other better.” “That’s what they drafted us for, because they believe in us,” Culpepper said Wednesday, before C.R.’s game against Wisconsin at Veterans Memorial Stadium. “We get along pretty well together. We’re roommates, actually. He’s a great guy, on and off the field. Very humble. I love him.” Culpepper, 21, was the 21st-overall selection in July, a shortstop from Kansas State University. He signed for a bonus of $3.9 million, began his professional career last month with low-Class A Fort Myers and got promoted a couple of weeks ago to high-A. He went into Thursday hitting .184 in 14 games for the Kernels. “It’s been pretty crazy. It’s been fun, too,” Culpepper said. “Just going from college to pro ball is a jump. But I’ve been looking forward to it my whole life. I’m just having fun out here. Playing every day is definitely a grind, but I like to embrace that.” Culpepper went not quite two months between his last college game and first pro game, which he said was difficult. There was some rust there to knock off. He was a bit surprised it was the Twins who ended up pulling the trigger on him draft wise. “The only time I talked to them was at the draft combine in Arizona. I met with them then,” he said. “It was a pretty nice meeting, but they really weren’t giving off vibes that they were going to draft me. Plus I had a meeting with my agent, my adviser the night before, and my (draft) range didn’t really add up with them. So on draft day, I was surprised. But I couldn’t be more happy.” Jenkins was taken fifth overall last year as a high school outfielder from North Carolina. He hit a ton in limited time after signing his pro contract, one with a $7-plus million bonus. The 19-year-old hurt his hamstring in his first game this season for Fort Myers and missed much time. He eventually returned, played well enough to get moved to Cedar Rapids, struggled initially but has been especially impressive the past couple of weeks or so. His batting average has climbed to .280 in 30 games with the Kernels, with 11 doubles, two triples, three home runs and 14 RBIs. He has looked every bit the top-five minor league prospect most experts have listed him. “You’re always working through mechanics as a hitter. But I think it’s just, no matter where I’m at, there are going to be adjustments,” Jenkins said. ”But I think I’m making the adjustments to the league and performing well. “The coaching staff here, the hitting coaches, the coordinators, everybody has just been a huge help. They are there when I need them, mentally or swing wise. I think I’ve worked hard. It’s a testament to some of that hard work and a lot of people being there for me.“ Jenkins is “just getting comfortable here,” Kernels Manager Brian Dinkelman said. “He doesn’t really expand the zone too much, does a lot of damage when the ball is in the heart of the plate,” Dinkelman said. “He’s a hitter. He’s going to hit. As long as he gets his pitch to hit, he’s going to be just fine.” Dinkelman was asked what he has seen from Culpepper in limited viewing. “He’s been fine. Battling up there, having good at-bats,” the manager said. “It’s just an adjustment of being off for a couple of months there when his college season was over. Now he’s just trying to get back into the swing of playing regularly, every day, which is something he’s probably not used to, yet. “He’s had good at-bats, and what has been most impressive to me has been his defense. He’s been solid, shows a good arm across the diamond. So just finish out this week and go to work in the offseason.” Jenkins said he feels this season, shortened though it was by injury, has helped him get a step closer to the big leagues. It’ll be interesting to see if he can take another step or two or three next season. And if Culpepper can take them with him. “He’s awesome,” Jenkins said. “Obviously he hasn’t been here for a super long time ... But the way he goes about his business on and off the field, I speak very highly of him.” Comments: jeff.johnson@thegazette.com [Jeff Johnson](https://www.thegazette.com/jeff-johnson/) [Minor League Sports](https://www.thegazette.com/minor-league-sports/) Sep. 8, 2024 8:08 pm25d ago [Savannah Blake](https://www.thegazette.com/savannah-blake/) [Photos and Videos](https://www.thegazette.com/photos-videos/) Sep. 5, 2024 11:30 am28d ago [Gazette Visuals](https://www.thegazette.com/gazette-visuals/) [Photos and Videos](https://www.thegazette.com/photos-videos/) Aug. 19, 2024 2:26 pm45d ago [Minor League Sports](https://www.thegazette.com/minor-league-sports/) Sep. 19, 2024 5:52 pm14d ago [Podcasts](https://www.thegazette.com/podcasts/) Oct. 4, 2024 4:00 am6h ago The Gazette has been informing Iowans with in-depth local news coverage and insightful analysis for over 140 years.
