Mataram, West Nusa Tenggara (ANTARA) - The West Nusa Tenggara Provincial Government is prioritizing the economic recovery of communities impacted by the flooding in Mataram City.\nActing Provincial Secretary Lalu Moh Faozal elaborated that following the completion of physical recovery efforts, the next step is to restore the economy of the communities affected by the disaster.\n“We can see on the field that physical repairs are nearly complete. Now, we are discussing how to move forward with the economic recovery,” he remarked here on Thursday.\nFaozal noted that West Nusa Tenggara Governor Lalu Muhamad Iqbal had already held discussions with the Financial Services Authority (OJK) to explore options for supporting the restoration of residents' livelihoods.\nHe explained that economic recovery efforts are being discussed, as most of the affected communities belong to vulnerable economic groups, including micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and small traders.\nRelated news: Jakarta floods: Weather modification planned to reduce rainfall\n“The governor has spoken with OJK.
