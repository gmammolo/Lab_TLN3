The transaction is pending league and federation approval.\nJacquesson returns to the Steel City after playing collegiately at the University of Pittsburgh, where he played three seasons and helped the Panthers twice reach the NCAA College Cup Semifinals. He was the 2020-21 Atlantic Coast Conference Freshman of the Year and finished his time at Pitt with 19 goals and 23 assists.\n“Bertin is a dangerous attacking player with pace and the ability to score or set up teammates,” said Hounds Head Coach Bob Lilley. “We are excited to have him back in Pittsburgh and look forward to having him available for the remainder of the season.”\nIn 2023, Jacquesson was the No. 16 pick in the MLS SuperDraft by Real Salt Lake. He subsequently made his professional debut that April. Over the past two seasons, he has split time between Real Salt Lake and its reserve side in MLS NEXT Pro, Real Monarchs SLC. He has 13 appearances for RSL with one assist in all competitions, and another 18 for Real Monarchs, scoring two goals and adding two assists.\nWith the Hounds, Jacquesson will be reunited with his former college teammate, midfielder Jackson Walti, as well as another Pitt alumnus, forward Edward Kizza.",
