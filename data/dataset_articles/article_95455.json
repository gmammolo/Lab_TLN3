  "text": "(Albany) -- State-ranked Albany football made their ranking stand up this past Friday, rolling to a 66-6 win over Stewartsville/Osborn.\nThe co-No. 4 ranked Warriors played their brand of football in the win while rushing for 169 yards and five touchdowns on just 14 carries. They also threw for 63 yards and three more scores.\n“Week 1 can always be kind of a mystery,” Albany head coach Doug Fountain told KMA Sports. “A little bit of uncertainty of what you’re going to get. We’ve got a pretty veteran crew with a lot of returning experience. That’s not to say some roles haven’t changed a bit, but these kids have played a lot of varsity snaps.”\nNobody carried the ball more than the five times Elliot Mercer did, as he finished with 80 yards and three touchdowns. Kole Emerson and Trevor Akins also scored rushing touchdowns, and quarterback Chase Cline threw for 50 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Emerson, Zane Rippy and Jared Owens all had one receiving touchdown.\n“We had some advantages in some areas,” Fountain said. “We’ve certainly been on the other side of that coin before. We played at a level we thought was a good level, we executed and we were pleased.”\nThe defense was also strikingly balanced with Mercer’s 6.0 tackles leading the way. Mercer also had 5.0 tackles for loss and 2.0 sacks among those six takedowns. In all, 15 players were credited with at least one tackle.\n“We’ve got some guys with certain skills,” Fountain said. “We really want to develop where we can hurt you with multiple people in multiple ways. The kids did a good job. Defensively at the jamboree (a week earlier), there were some things we were missing and not playing the way we want to play. I thought we shored those things up on Friday night.”\nNow, Albany turns their attention to a matchup at home with East Atchison (1-0). The Wolves were also dominant in the opening week, pulling away from King City for a 58-24 win. Quarterback Blake Simmons was honored as the KMA Sports Agrivision Equipment Group Player of the Night after throwing for 176 yards, rushing for 71 and accounting for six touchdowns.\n“They look to me to be a tremendous football team,” Fountain said. “They beat a very good King City team on Friday night, and they’ve got a lot of strengths. They’re very athletic in the skill spots. Very dynamic up front, and their kids get after it. Real physical in the box with the run game.”\nSenior Cameron Kephart will likely have Fountain and Albany’s attention after seven receptions for 141 yards and two touchdowns. Meanwhile, Brody Wennihan had a big night on defense with 15.0 tackles and 2.0 TFLs. Cameron Brooks and River Dow also had double-digit tackles with 11.0 and 10.0, respectively.\n“They’ve got multiple guys that can hurt you with the ball in their hands,” Fountain added. “Multiple offensively and defensively as East Atchison teams always are. They’re just stellar and physical at the line of scrimmage. They work off blocks extremely well, are always in leverage and well-coached. We’ll have a battle on our hands, and we’re looking forward to it.”\nLast season, Albany won a defensive battle with the Wolves, 22-18.\n“They’re going to play great defense,” Fountain said. “Our challenge is going to be keeping the explosive plays at a minimum because they’ve got the ability to hit you with home runs at any point on the field. We’ve got to keep the speed corralled and play with great discipline. Offensively, they don’t give up big chunks so we’re going to have to be disciplined to maintain and sustain drives and finish them in the red zone.”\nCasey Martin will have reports from Albany on Friday evening during the Midline Farms Football Connection Show. Listen to all of KMA Sports’ Week 2 coverage on AM 960, FM 99.1 and streaming at\nkmaland.com throughout the evening on Friday from 6:20 to midnight.\nHear the full interview with Coach Fountain in the audio file below.",
