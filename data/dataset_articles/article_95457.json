  "text": "Throughout its run to winning both the final Pac-12 regular-season and conference tournament titles, Arizona players and coaches raved about how close the team was and how well everyone got along. This could easily be dismissed as hyperbole, but then the offseason came and none of the core players entered the NCAA transfer portal and infielder Garen Caulfield opted to return for a fourth year rather than begin his pro career. And the 2025 team will have three players from last season’s squad on the coaching staff, with catcher Blake McDonald announced Thursday as the third recent ex-Wildcat to join his former bosses. These guys are bought in— Arizona Baseball (@ArizonaBaseball) Blake McDonald is the third Wildcat from last year's squad joining our staff for the 2025 season! Excited to keep Blake around as a graduate manager [pic.twitter.com/JOPjQxUrAK] [September 5, 2024] McDonald, who played one season for the UA after starting his career at Saint Mary’s, joins ex-UA pitchers Dawson Netz and Bradon Zastrow as managers for 2025. A .297 hitter with two home runs and 18 RBI, McDonald split catching duties last season with Adonys Guzman, who is coming back for his junior year. The Wildcats have three other catchers on their fall roster, and it’s likely that McDonald will assist hitting coach Toby DeMello with that position. Netz, who finished his UA career tied for second in appearances with 94, and Zastrow will be added help to pitching coach Kevin Vance and director of pitching performance and strategy John DeRouin.",
