  "text": "STORRS, Conn. — The 2023-24 UConn men's basketball team is expected to meet President Joe Biden at the White House after their latest national championship win, according to the university Thursday. The back-to-back NCAA champions will return to the White House on Sept. 10, marking the university's sixth appearance since 1999. The team will be joined by 2024 NCAA women's basketball champion South Carolina University for a celebration, UConn said. UConn men won their sixth national title in a 75-60 victory against Purdue in Glendale, Ariz. in April, going 37-3 in the team's 2023-24 campaign. The win marked the first back-to-back national championship for a men's college basketball team in 17 years, according to the university. During the Huskies' previous visits to the White House, they were greeted by then presidents Bill Clinton in 1999, George W. Bush in 2004, and Barack Obama in 2011, as well as current President Biden in 2023. Sean Humphrey is a digital content producer at FOX61 News.
