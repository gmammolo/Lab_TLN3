  "text": "[Sports](/sports) [Tennis](/sports/tennis) U.S. Open's on-site salon gives players another way to show their style For tennis players at the U.S. Open, serving looks is almost as important as a clean first serve. It can be a confidence boost to wear something fashionable or eye-catching during a match. But hair and proper grooming matter, too. That’s why Julien Farel’s salon in Arthur Ashe Stadium has become an exclusive perk players look forward to. Nestled in the player facilities near the gym, the salon is where athletes get pampered before or after a match. The air conditioned room is also an escape from the heat and humidity. “It’s a superstition or ritual that they like to come and engage in,” said Jackson Simmonds, stylist and brand ambassador for the salon. “The cameras are rolling, right? The world’s media is watching so [their look] needs to be functional so they can play but also look good at the same time.” Farel, whose main salon is located at the Loews Regency Hotel on 540 Park Avenue, opened the pop-up salon in 2007 and it’s remained a mainstay during the U.S. Open, except for 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. A team of two-to-three hair stylists have stations inside while two or three manicurists sit at another table. There’s also a slogan painted on the wall that changes every year, with this year’s slogan being “Ace Your Hair Game.” Not only can get players get their hair washed and shampooed, they can also get manicures and pedicures. They can even get their hair styled a certain way. Simmonds, who’s working his 12th Open, said his favorite story was in 2010 when Rafael Nadal walked in. Nadal’s long hair was part of his look but Farel convinced him to get a haircut. After Farel cut Nadal’s hair, Nadal went on to win the Open, his first of four trophies here. “Rafa is very superstitious so that added one more layer to it,” Simmonds said. There was also Jelena Jankovic, who needed her hair braided before matches. Simmonds recalled Jankovic asking for him even if he was with another client and Simmonds often stopped to braid her hair. Getting an appointment, however, isn’t easy. The salon only does same-day appointments so players, or their coaches or assistants, have to arrive early to book a session. On average, the salon has 20-25 daily appointments during the Open’s first week. Time is also important since the salon has limited hours. For the first week this year, the salon is open from 9 a.m.-4 p.m. For the second week when there's fewer players around, it’s open from 10 a.m.-2 p.m. and the clients range from players' families, coaches or USTA officials. Thursday was quiet as Simmonds and another stylist worked on their respective clients’ hair. It's a contrast to the first week when more people shuffle in and out while more than a few linger outside. “It’s super busy but never a dull moment,” said Katie Mae Horne, who’s working her first Open as a stylist. “Like, everyone’s super respectful. Everyone’s excited to be here.” With the finals this weekend, things can get tense. The winner in the women’s tournament might need a quick hair appointment before the trophy presentation. Last year, Coco Gauff came by after winning her first Open. Two years ago, it was Iga Swiatek arriving for a late session once she won the Open. “It was a late night, I think it was like 1 a.m., but we got it done,” Simmonds said. There’s pride for the stylists seeing their handiwork on the court. But there’s more pride in creating a space where athletes can unwind before a match. In a sport where style matters, the salon is a win for the players looking their best before serving their best on the court. “I think it’s really important to help people feel good about themselves so they can perform their best,” Horne said. “And I think it’s really cool that we’re able to play a part in that.\" More tennis [Gauff rallies against qualifier to reach China Open semis against Badosa2m read](/sports/tennis/china-shanghai-tennis-j17499) [Alcaraz rallies past Sinner to win China Open and make it 3-for-3 against his top rival this year4m read](/sports/tennis/sinner-alcaraz-tennis-atp-wta-china-t08330) [Sinner to play Alcaraz in China Open final and Osaka out with back injury2m read](/sports/tennis/tennis-atp-wta-china-japan-o15332) [Sinner and Alcaraz through to China Open semifinals, Sabalenka rolls on3m read](/sports/tennis/tennis-atp-wta-china-japan-n97529)",
