  "text": "In a standout performance that marked the beginning of his college football career, University of Iowa freshman wide receiver Reece Vander Zee made headlines not just for his athletic prowess but also for his public declaration of faith. After scoring two touchdowns in the No. 21-ranked Hawkeyes’ 40-0 victory over the Illinois State University Redbirds at the season opener, Vander Zee credited his success to his faith in Jesus Christ.\nFor any freshman, the first game of the college football season is a nerve-wracking experience. But for Reece Vander Zee, it was an opportunity to showcase the talent and faith that had brought him to this point. The Rock Rapids, Iowa native, who had been a two-time all-state selection in high school, recorded 66 receiving yards on five catches in his debut game. More importantly, he found the end zone twice, helping to lead the Hawkeyes to a dominant victory.\nWhen asked during a post-game press conference if he had anticipated such a performance in his first game, Vander Zee’s humility and faith were on full display.\n“To be honest, I didn’t,” Vander Zee responded candidly. “I credit my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for just giving me this opportunity. A lot of things fell into place for me to be here, and I just get all my confidence from Him. I just prayed that He gave me confidence. And I went out there, and I showed that today.”\nFor Vander Zee, faith is more than just a part of his life—it’s the foundation upon which he builds everything. His social media presence, particularly his X (formerly Twitter) account, is a testament to this. The biography section of his profile features a reference to Luke 14:11, which reads, “For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.” This verse encapsulates the humility and faith that guide Vander Zee’s life.\nIn a pinned post from June 2023, when Vander Zee announced his commitment to play football at the University of Iowa, he expressed his gratitude and dedication to glorifying God through his athletic career.\n“I want to thank my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for blessing me and equipping me with amazing gifts,” Vander Zee wrote. “I truly want to glorify Him in everything I do and can’t wait to see what amazing plans He has for me!”\nAfter such a strong start, fans and teammates alike will be eager to see how this Christian freshman receiver continues to develop.",
