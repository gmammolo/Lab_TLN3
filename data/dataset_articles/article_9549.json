  "text": "Firefighters in Los Angeles successfully rescued 31 workers trapped in a collapsed tunnel on Wednesday (July 9). The incident occurred at North Figueroa Street in Wilmington, where the structural lining of the tunnel failed approximately six miles from the entrance. The tunnel, which is 18 feet wide, is part of Los Angeles' Clearwater Project, a municipal wastewater management initiative expected to be completed in 2027. The collapse occurred more than five miles from the Wilmington access point. The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) dispatched over 100 first responders to the scene, including specialized search and rescue teams. The workers, who were operating a tunnel boring machine at the time of the collapse, had to climb through debris to reach safety. Interim Fire Chief Ronnie Villanueva stated, \"Tonight we were lucky,\" as all workers were evacuated without visible injuries . Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass praised the rescue efforts, calling it a \"victory.\" The construction on the tunnel is currently paused as the contractor assesses the damage and determines the necessary repairs. Robert Ferrante , chief engineer for the L.A. County Sanitation Districts, noted the unpredictable nature of tunneling conditions, which contributed to the collapse. The investigation will focus on identifying the cause and ensuring the tunnel's safety before work resumes.",
