Breaking down Ronaldo's 900 career goals This goal added to Cristiano's already staggering tally, marking his 131st in international football , per talkSPORT . His remaining 769 goals were scored across an illustrious club career. Ronaldo's journey began at Sporting Lisbon, where he netted five times, before rising to prominence at Manchester United, where he scored 144 goals over two spells. However, his most prolific years were spent at Real Madrid , where he netted an astonishing 450 goals in just nine seasons. Following his time in Spain, he added another 101 goals while playing for Juventus, and since his move to Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia, he has racked up an additional 68 strikes. Guinness World Record crowns Ronaldo as GOAT Following this monumental feat, tributes poured in from across the football world . Guinness World Records (GWR) joined the celebration, offering a notable acknowledgement of Ronaldo’s greatness. GWR responded to a BBC post highlighting Ronaldo's 900-goal achievement with a simple yet profound GOAT emoji, implying that the Portuguese star may indeed be the greatest footballer of all time. This gesture from GWR, a renowned authority on human achievements, adds another layer of recognition to Ronaldo’s extraordinary career, a journey filled with unmatched records and accolades.
