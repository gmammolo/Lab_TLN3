The battle continues as countries vie for a spot in the 2026 World Cup finals in the US, Mexico, and Canada. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 06-09-2024 02:42 IST | Created: 06-09-2024 02:42 IST Asia's third round of World Cup qualifying kicked off with unexpected results, the most surprising being Bahrain's 1-0 victory over Australia. Qatar suffered a 3-1 loss to the United Arab Emirates, while South Korea and Saudi Arabia were held to draws by lower-ranked teams. The Korean team faced backlash from fans after a goalless draw against Palestine, marking the first game under new coach Hong Myung-bo. Saudi Arabia, despite a home turf advantage, drew 1-1 with Indonesia, with goalkeeper Maarten Paes saving Salem Al-Dawsari's penalty. Elsewhere, Japan demonstrated dominance with a 7-0 victory over China, and Iran secured a 1-0 win against Kyrgyzstan. The path to the 2026 World Cup finals in the US, Mexico, and Canada remains fiercely competitive as teams aim for direct qualification or face additional qualifying rounds.
