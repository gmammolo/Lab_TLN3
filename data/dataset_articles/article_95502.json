  "text": "University of Maine women’s soccer coach Scott Atherley, who guided the Black Bears to their first America East tournament title and NCAA playoff berth last fall, has agreed to a five-year contract extension through the 2028 season.\nTerms of the contract were not released.\nAs of July 1, Atherley was making $88,000 per year after making $85,118 last year. That will increase to $91,500 with annual raises as well, according to UMaine Director of Athletics Jude Killy.\nThe Black Bears went 11-2-6 last fall, 4-1-3 in league play, and beat UMass Lowell 3-2 in double overtime in the championship game.\nUMaine was eliminated by Harvard 3-0 in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\nAtherley and assistant Liis Abbott were named the America East Coaching Staff of the Year.\nThe Black Bears’ 8-0-4 start to the 2023 campaign was the best start in program history.\nUMaine is 2-1-2 so far this season.\nThe Andover, Connecticut native has been the women’s coach since 1999 when he was also the men’s head coach. He spent seven years as the men’s coach.\nAtherley, a former player and soccer captain at UMaine who graduated in 1988, had one of the most successful back-to-back campaigns in his coaching career in 2022 and 2023.\nHis Black Bears went 9-3-5 overall in 2022, 4-0-4 in conference play, and earned their first America East postseason berth since the 2016 season.\nIt was also UMaine’s first winning season overall and in conference play since 2015.\n“I am grateful for the opportunity to continue to lead the women’s soccer program at a place that holds a special place in my heart,” said Atherley in a press release. “I want to thank President (Joan) Ferrini-Mundy and Director of Athletics Jude Killy for their unwavering support.\n“I also want to recognize our coaching staff for their dedicated commitment and teamwork in building a great program. It’s a privilege to be a part of the athletics family at UMaine and to work alongside such wonderful people,” he said.\nKilly said he was excited to have Atherley on board for several more years.\n“He has developed a culture where student-athletes are committed to success in competition, in the classroom and in the community. Scott is passionate about and dedicated to his alma mater, and he remains a great ambassador for our department and the university,” said Killy.\nAtherley will get the opportunity to coach his daughter, Teagan, at UMaine next fall. She is an All-Class A North Region midfielder at Bangor High School.\nAnd the program, which currently plays on the baseball field, Mahaney Diamond, is supposed to get a new artificial turf soccer field within the next two years thanks to the $170 million gift from the Harold Alfond Foundation for upgrades to the institution’s athletic facilities.\nThe Black Bears will look to snap a scoreless stretch of 254 minutes and 49 seconds on Sunday at noon when they entertain Stonehill College (Massachusetts).",
