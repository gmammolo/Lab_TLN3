  "text": "Mike Wright Leads Northwestern to Victory in First Start as QB\nMike Wright's debut as\nNorthwestern's quarterback resulted in a close 13-6 victory over Miami Ohio, showcasing his potential despite some areas needing improvement. Having transferred from Mississippi State, Wright completed 60% of his passes, added 65 rushing yards, and demonstrated a knack for making crucial throws in tight windows. The game highlighted Wright's effectiveness, though he didn’t find the end zone through the air. Overall, this inaugural performance leaves both promise and room for growth as the season unfolds.\n- 18-of-30 passing for 178 yards, no touchdowns, no interceptions.\n- 9 carries for 65 yards and 1 rushing touchdown.\n- Averaged 5.9 yards per attempt with a 73.2 PFF offensive grade.\n- Wright adjusted well, delivering effective passes despite early inaccuracies.\n- Led the offense with a mix of passing and rushing, keeping defenses guessing.\nAs the season progresses, expect Wright to further develop his chemistry with the offense, potentially enhancing his passing effectiveness and decision-making under pressure. Increased use of designed runs and bootlegs could be explored to exploit his mobility.Bottom Line\nWright's initial showing offers hope for Northwestern's offense. While there were missed opportunities, his ability to adapt points to a promising trajectory. Continued improvement in execution will be key for sustaining success throughout the season.\nRead more at\n Inside NU\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
