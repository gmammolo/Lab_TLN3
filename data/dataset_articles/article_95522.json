  "text": "Vanessa Low reckons motherhood is her superpower and with her young son Matteo watching from the stands of Stade de France she took flight.She set a new world record of 5.45m in the T63 long jump, on her first jump. She jumped the exact same distance with her fifth jump, and after she fouled her final jump she rushed to the fence where her husband and coach Scott Reardon and Matteo were waiting.Low and Reardon embraced, there were tears of joy, little Matteo was just taking it all in. He'll be too young to remember what his mother achieved in Paris but memories were made.It was Low's fourth Paralympics, she won gold for Germany in Rio before switching her allegiances to Australia where she defended her medal in Tokyo. She knew her competing days weren't over but she was keen to start a family. Matteo was born in 2022.Low and Reardon are based in Canberra. Reardon is considered one of Australia's greatest ever Paralympians, with a gold medal from Rio and a silver from Tokyo, and multiple world championship titles under his belt. He famously learned to walk again in a week and a half, after an accident on the family farm in Temora severed his right leg when he was 12.But on Friday morning, he was first and foremost a proud husband and father and coach.Lauren Parker wasn't going to let a stomach upset get in the way of her medal dreams. She added to her Paris collection by dominating the women's h1-4 cycling road race, finishing the 28.4km course in 52min 4sec, 4min 11sec ahead of reigning Paralympic champion Jennette Janson.She revealed she's been ill since Monday's triathlon where she swallowed some water during the swim leg in the Seine on her way to the gold medal.The water quality of the Seine has been a talking point since Paris was awarded both the Olympics and the Paralympics. In both Games, events have been delayed until organisers deemed it safe.But Parker put that all aside. In 2017, she was told she would never be an athlete again after she suffered a broken back, spinal-cord damage, a broken shoulder, four broken ribs, a punctured lung and a shattered pelvis when she crashed in training for the Ironman Australia triathlon. She called on all that resilience on the road race couse at Clichy-sous-Bois.She broke clear on the first climb after six kilometres and was a minute and a half ahead at the halfway mark.Torrential rain early in the day caused confusion as officials firstly delayed the start by an hour, then advised the race would be cut to one lap before finally confirming only minutes before the start that it would remain at two laps. With two gold and a silver in her luggage, Parker is now wondering what's next.No one was going to catch reigning world record holder Tim Hodge in the men's SM9 200m individual medley.He swam a strong opening butterfly leg and held the lead throughout, setting a new Paralympic record of 2min 13.31sec.It was his second gold medal in Paris, after the mixed 100m medley relay (34 points) gold on day five in Paris,Samuel von Einem continued Australia's great run in the table tennis, grabbing a bronze medal in the men's MS11 singles table tennis.He went down to Korea's Gi Tae Kim 11-5, 8-11, 11-9, 15-13 but both losing semi-finallists are awarded bronze medals. Australia's ninth on the medal tally at the end of Day 8. We've won 14 gold, 12 silver and 19 bronze for a total of 45 medals.China surges ahead with 74 gold, in their amazing total of 166. Great Britain, the USA, the Netherlands and France round out the top five.",
