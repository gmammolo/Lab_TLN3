  "text": "Jefferson football shows support for Apalachee, repaints field with Wildcat 'A' There has been an outpouring of support from schools across the state of Georgia [after a gunman killed](https://www.onlineathens.com/story/graphics/2024/09/04/georgia-high-school-shooting-timeline/75074179007/) two students and two teachers at Apalachee High School Wednesday morning. One of the teachers killed was [Richard Aspinwall](https://www.onlineathens.com/story/sports/high-school/football/2024/09/04/apalachee-football-coach-mike-hancock-1-of-9-injured-in-school-shooting/75075381007/), the defensive coordinator for the Wildcat football team. Aspinwall, 39, was a Rome native and one of the first [hires at Apalachee under coach Mike Hancock](https://www.onlineathens.com/story/news/2024/09/04/apalachee-football-coach-mourns-loss-of-dc-ricky-aspinwall/75080274007/) ahead of the 2023 season. He held coaching stints with Mountain View High School in Lawrenceville and Dunwoody High School as well. Several coaches have personally reached out to Hancock personally to offer a shoulder to lean on for support, [including Georgia football coach Kirby Smart](https://www.onlineathens.com/story/sports/college/bulldogs-extra/2024/09/05/georgia-football-kirby-smart-said-apalachee-school-shooting/75085079007/). \"We've got a great community of coaches here in Northeast Georgia,\" Hancock said. \"You got your Travis Nolands (Jefferson), Kevin Reach (Monroe Area), and there's others. All those guys, I've been on the phone with (on Wednesday). One, they're reaching out to support me. But two, it's me reaching out to them for advice. There's not a section in the head coach's manual on how to deal with a situation like this. Those guys have given me a lot of words of wisdom. (Former Apalachee coach) Tony Lotti, too, being one of them. Those guys just reached out to check on me, to check on our staff and to check on our kids. And there's others. But the community of coaches just in this area are amazing.\" Noland is a coach all too familiar with the throes of tragedy [after the incident that took Elijah Dewitt's life too soon](https://www.onlineathens.com/story/sports/high-school/football/2022/10/10/how-jefferson-football-moves-forward-after-death-elijah-dewitt/8216608001/) in October 2022 — Dewitt, 18, was shot and killed in Lawrenceville in the Sugarloaf Mills mall parking lot. \"Being a head football coach is a really tough job, day in and day out,\" Noland said. \"But then, when the roll becomes more than just 'coach,' and there's so many kids needing so much direction and strength, and then his staff, cause coaching staffs are just like the team, those coaches are so close. For all of that to change in just a matter of minutes, I wanted him to know that I was here for him, we were here for him as a program. What happened yesterday was such a tragedy, but the hardest days are yet to come.\" The Jefferson football program is showing its support as a unit by wearing an 'A' decal on their helmets for the remainder of the season. They also painted over the signature 'J' logo at centerfield at Memorial Stadium, replacing it with an 'A' inside the Dragon diamond. \"We suffered a tremendous tragedy two years ago in our program and there were so many people and programs that were generous and kind to us,\" Noland said. \"This is just a small token of showing our respect for them as a community, for their community. It might be there for the rest of the year. \"From what we learned two years ago, there's a lot of long, hard days ahead, not just this week, and we want them to know that somebody's pulling for them and there for them. We'll continue to show support any way we can.\"",
