  "text": "By Justin Tasch ,\n3 hours ago\nJohn Sterling is hopping back on the saddle as the Yankees chase their elusive 28th World Series.\nThe 86-year-old longtime Yankees radio voice, who retired in April, is coming back to call the team’s playoff games for WFAN, he announced on Thursday.\nYankees execs green-lit Sterling’s return last week and Chris Oliviero, who runs WFAN as Audacy New York president, offered Sterling the postseason gig on Thursday, according to The Athletic .\nAaron Boone’s and Brian Cashman’s surprising faith in Alex Verdugo led to Yankees’ divisive Jasson Dominguez decision\n“I miss meeting with all the other broadcasters and writers and people behind the scenes,” Sterling said during WFAN’s “Evan & Tiki” show. “I kind of miss that. And I’ll tell you what I really miss is broadcasting with Suzyn, who is such a fabulous partner and we were together for so long. This will give me a chance at a last hurrah, and work with Suzyn again.”\nSterling, who will reunite with longtime booth partner Suzyn Waldman, will travel for the road games, something The Athletic reports WFAN brass wanted as part of the agreement to temporarily bring him back.\nHow Aaron Boone responded to Alex Verdugo not running out ground ball\nThe Athletic reported two weeks ago that Sterling was set to talk to Oliviero about returning for the playoffs before resuming his retirement.\nSterling began the 2024 season as the Yankees’ radio play-by-player but retired on April 15 , with the Yankees holding an on-field ceremony for him on April 20.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR STARTING LINEUP NEWSLETTER\nEmmanuel Berbari, Rickie Ricardo and Justin Shackil have primarily rotated as the fill-in play-by-play voices, though it remains unclear who will replace Sterling full-time next season.\nJohn Sterling during his Yankees retirement ceremony on April 20, 2024. Robert Sabo for NY Post Sterling said on The Post’s “The Show with Joel Sherman and Jon Heyman” podcast in June that he was “staying out of” the process of determining his replacement.\n“I don’t want to hurt one person for another. I think the kids are doing a great job. No problems,” Sterling said.\nFor the latest in sports, top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com/sports/\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
