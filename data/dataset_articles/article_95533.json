  "text": "Pearman on the cusp of Gosling’s Moongate Tour glory Dwayne Pearman is set to be declared the 2024 Gosling’s Moongate Tour Order of Merit winner on Friday. A tight two-horse race between series leader Pearman and nearest rival and fellow professional Chris Smith had been poised to go down to the wire in the final medal event at Port Royal Golf Course. However, Smith has been ruled out as he is travelling overseas, leaving Pearman with an unassailable lead heading into today’s 18-hole strokeplay event at the par-71 Southampton course. Very little separated the pair with Pearman clinging to a slim 0.71 point advantage over Smith. “I won’t be playing in the final event as I am in the UK taking my son to school,” Smith told The Royal Gazette. “Good luck to Dwayne and all the other players in the final event.” Also ruled out are Tour co-founder Chaka DeSilva and top amateur Kenny Leseur who are also off island, the latter attending school at Butler University. That leaves Pearman, who already has two wins under his belt this year, having all but secured the title. “It’s cool to be in this position. I missed the last two tournaments so I don’t have any expectations,” he said. “I just want to try and play well playing my favourite course in the world. “I am hitting it OK, I just haven’t been in any tournaments. I have just been knocking it around a little bit.” Today’s medal event features one of the strongest fields assembled this year, which includes professionals Camiko Smith, Nick Jones and last year’s Order of Merit winner Scott Roy, who are expected to be in contention. Jones and Roy have already savoured success this year with one win each under their belt. Also expected to be in the hunt for medal honours are top amateurs Jarryd Dillas, Eric West, Jevon Roberts, Will Haddrell and Oliver Betschart, the 2023 Moongate Tour Championship winner.
