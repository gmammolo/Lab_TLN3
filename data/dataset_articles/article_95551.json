  "text": "For the sake of my fantasy team, I hope he’s right. All eyes will be on New York Jets quarterback [Aaron Rodgers](http://whiskeyriff.com/tag/aaron-rodgers) on Monday night to see how he performs in his long-awaited NFL return. The 40-year old QB signed with the Jets in 2023 after spending 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers, but went down with a torn Achilles on the fourth snap with his new team, forcing him to miss the entire season as he recovered. After videos surfaced last season of Rodgers throwing bombs during practice, and seemingly putting full weight on his injured leg, there was a lot of talk that his miraculous recovery might have allowed him to return for the end of the 2023 season. But once the Jets were eliminated from playoff contention, Rodgers took the rest of the season to heal and get ready to make his return this year. And he’s got high expectations for himself. The Jets play the San Francisco 49ers on Monday Night Football for week 1, and Rodgers spoke to the media today about how he’s going to feel stepping out onto the field after being knocked out so early last year – especially after he gets past the fourth snap: “There might be a little smirk after the fourth one, I dunno. We’ll see. I’m sure they’ll catch it. But I’m in a good mindspace. Really had a year to remember, in a lot of ways, some really difficult things but some great things as well.” [#Jets]QB Aaron Rodgers told Rich Cimini of ESPN that he might give a smirk after getting past the 4th play in Week 1 vs the [#49ers]on Monday Night Football. Said he’s sure the cameras will catch it. 🤣 🎥 [@nyjets] [#JetUp] [pic.twitter.com/kt9jDzUzlx] — Paul Andrew Esden Jr (@BoyGreen25) [September 5, 2024] And though he missed (basically) an entire season, that doesn’t mean that Rodgers is going to cut himself any slack: “I have a lot of pride in my performance. When I take the field, I expect greatness. Because I’ve done it before, so that’s kind of the standard I hold myself to.” \"When I take the field, I expect greatness\" – Aaron Rodgers [pic.twitter.com/BIh9J0iDp9] — Jets Videos (@snyjets) [September 5, 2024] I’ve got Rodgers on my Fantasy Football bench, just waiting to go in if he comes back and sets the world on fire. So I really hope that he can live up to his own expectations this season. But regardless, man it’s good to have football back again.",
