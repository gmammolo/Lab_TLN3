  "text": "The NBL championship-winning Tasmania JackJumpers have again placed their faith in Clint Steindl. The 35-year-old will continue as the team's captain for his fourth-consecutive season. Steindl is the young franchise's inaugural skipper and he is renowned for setting high standards and his dedication to team success. Meanwhile, superstar guard Milton Doyle has promoted to vice-captain alongside Fabijan Krslovic to make up the three-player leadership team. The trio will guide the JackJumpers through the NBL Blitz on the Gold Coast starting this Saturday, followed by the FIBA Intercontinental Cup kicking off on Tuesday, September 10. Coach Scott Roth lauded the exciting three-point shooter. \"It's been an amazing journey with you, my friend. We're excited to have you back leading this team and setting the example both on and off the court,\" he said. Krslovic, who has also been with the JackJumpers since their inaugural season, returns as vice-captain for the second year. Roth had praise for the versatile forward. \"Fab, it's truly amazing to see how far you've come since you joined us. Your growth on and off the court has been tremendous, and we're proud to have you continue in this leadership role,\" he said. It will be Doyle's third NBL season and he has arguably been the JackJumpers' best player across the past two. Roth highlighted the significance of Doyle's appointment. \"It's a rare honour for an import to step into a leadership role on an Australian team,\" he said. \"Milton has earned this through his performance, dedication, and the respect of his teammates. Having his family here today to celebrate makes this moment even more special.\" Chief executive officer Christine Finnegan said the club was proud to have the trio leading the team. \"This club is about action, not words, and these three truly embody that,\" she said. \"Clint, in particular, has always led by example, staying involved with the community and setting the bar high for everyone.\" The JackJumpers open their campaign on September 19 against Melbourne United at Perth's RAC Arena as part of HoopsFest.
