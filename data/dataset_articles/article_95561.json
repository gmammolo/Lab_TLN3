  "text": "Football season is officially in play , which means fans across the nation will be meeting up to yell, scream, eat and drink their way all the way through to the Super Bowl. And sports bars give friends, frenemies and foes alike the perfect place to stew in a melting pot of gridiron devotees, ready to cheer, boo or cry together all season. Looking for wings and other munchable, drinkable things, and places ready to fill the bill? We've got some lively suggestions across the Space Coast (including one spot where the owner might just get more carried away when a certain team from Pennsylvania is playing). Broken Barrel Tavern 4700 S. Babcock St, Palm Bay | 321-728-4755 A South Brevard favorite since 2009. Grab some chili and a BBQ quesadilla and watch at this \"foot-beer themed Sports Bar.\" Food is smoked from scratch, with pecan wood, and they take their sports teams, beer selection (all 40 on draft) and whiskey very seriously. Guests can be particular about whiskey and still have so much fun in this 7,000-square-foot venue. More: 25 years on, Chumley's is still a welcoming place where they really do know your name Buffalo Wild Wings 7191 Lake Andrew Drive, Viera | 321-638-0882 4325 Norfolk Pkwy., West Melbourne | 321-951-2138 Just because it's a chain doesn't mean it's not a great place to watch some sports. Tired of wings? Try those cauliflower bites with ranch, delish! They will have this game, that game and replays of the other game on the big screen. You can't go wrong at any of their locations. King's Grill 400 Barton Blvd., Rockledge | 321-305-4252 This place has 21 TVs, so no problem finding a spot to watch your favorite team (and those others, too). With half-price apps and happy hour all day at the bar on Sundays, you'll want to join the excitement. Sideline note: There's a strong Cocoa High and Florida tie to the NFL here. You may notice some love for the Philadelphia Eagles, as Chauncey \"C.J.\" Gardner-Johnson, owner Del Johnson's son , a safety, returns to the team this season on a three-year contract. Sandbar Sports Grill 1246 Highway A1A, Satellite Beach | 321-421-7657 With $10 pitchers, $20 buckets and some darn good flatbreads and tacos, the decor and atmosphere can't be beat on Sundays or Mondays. Check out those awesome murals and memorabilia while you are there. That said, the owner is a Bills fan, so there is a layer of sadness likely to happen at the end of the season. Maybe this will be their year. Maybe. More: Listen Now! Jacksonville Jaguars visit Miami Dolphins in Week 1 battle of AFC contenders Slide Inn 7090 N. Atlantic Ave, Cape Canaveral | 321-613-0800 Open since 2013 and with a friendly vibe, this is the place to go for plenty of pool tables, dart boards and loads of TVs everywhere. On the menu: 20-plus flavors of chicken wings and cheap drinks, along with the NFL ticket. Time Out Sports Bar 607 Florida Ave., Cocoa | 321-504-0823 \"A drinking establishment with a sports problem\" sounds like the place to be on a game day. Or any day, for that matter. Nosh on apps, into salads and pace yourself for the wings and burgers. A breakfast burger with bacon, avocado, fried egg, jack cheese and herb mayo? Yes, please. Perfect for that early game, it's like football brunch. They claim to not be your average sports bar, and they are not sorry about it. We love that for them. LET'S GO! The Twisted Birch 1279 Admiralty Blvd., Rockledge | 321-208-7616 Pot roast poutine, fried pickles or blue chips are on the menu, if you want a break from all of the sandwiches and wing flavors they offer. With 16 draft beers, pool table, and the NFL Ticket in HD, you will never miss a pass. With a full liquor bar and a view of the golf course, this is a great place to hang out as footballs fly.
