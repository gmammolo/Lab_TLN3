  "text": "Paris Paralympics 2024: Alfie Hewett sets up gold medal matches in singles & doubles • 2 MINUTE READ Alfie Hewett is through to the men’s wheelchair tennis singles final at the 2024 Paris Paralympic Games after a straight sets victory over world No.3 Martin De La Puente. The world No.1 defeated the Spaniard 6-2, 6-0 to punch his ticket into a second Paralympics singles final. [Hewett](/fan-zone/british-tennis-players/alfie-hewett/) is now in the gold medal match for the singles and doubles draw at Roland Garros and will be aiming to complete the career golden slam in both formats. He’s the first men’s player to reach the singles and doubles finals at the same Games on multiple occasions. \"It’s a great feeling,\" Hewett said. \"It was incredible match, I think I played probably one of my best performances, best matches and to do it in the semi-finals of a Paralympics is a big ask but I’m very proud of my level. \"I’ve been building in the week. Coming in I felt confident off the back of Wimbledon – I feel like I’m in a new chapter of my career. Coming here I’m just playing with freedom and trying to enjoy it. I think it’s definitely up there with some of my best tennis so let’s hope it keeps going. The 2016 singles silver medallist will have his eyes on the biggest prize on Saturday when he faces world No.2 Tokito Oda in the final. Hewett will also join forces with [Gordon Reid](/fan-zone/british-tennis-players/gordon-reid/) to face Oda and his partner Takuya Miki in tomorrow’s men’s doubles final starting not before 15:00. \"We’ve played a lot against each other in recent years, especially in big tournaments,\" he added. \"I’m sure it’s going to be a good match and I’m just really happy to make the final, I’m proud of that achievement. I’ll leave it all out there again and see what happens.\" As with their final at Wimbledon just a few months ago, it was a masterclass in aggressive returning from Hewett – who dropped only one point on the Spaniard’s serve in the first set. Hewett had been having a few problems of his own on serve but a series of errors from De La Puente with the Brit serving at 3-2, 40-40 gave him a pivotal hold that steadied the ship and set him on a run of 10 straight games. Mistakes proved costly for the Spanish No.1 and after being broken for a fourth time, he fired long on Hewett’s second set point to hand a one set lead to the top seed. Hewett had won 22 of their previous 23 meetings and the confidence was oozing through him at the start of the second set. In the opening game he hit an incredible no-look reverse backhand on his way to an early break advantage. De La Puente was unable to match the power and precision coming off the Hewett racket. Facing break point again at 2-0 down, the Spaniard hit a great wide serve, but Hewett was equal to it with a driven backhand winner. It remained the story of the match and as the 26-year-old clocked his 26th winner, he sealed an impressive win in an hour and nine minutes.",
