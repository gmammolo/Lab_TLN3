  "text": "By Josh Skluzacek ,\n2 hours ago Thanks to another strong outing from Pablo López and the back of the bullpen, plus a pair of home runs from the offense, the Minnesota Twins salvaged a series split with a 4-3 win over the Tampa Bay Rays on Thursday.\nThe win puts the Twins four games back of Cleveland and a half-game up on Kansas City, where the Twins head this weekend. It also marked the sixth one-run game between the Twins and Rays this season in their seven matchups, with Wednesday’s 9-4 Rays win the lone multi-run victory.\nThe Twins offense may not have been clicking on all cylinders on Thursday but they struck first with a good second inning.\nAfter Jose Miranda and Carlos Santana each singled to start the frame, Edouard Julien made it 3-0 Minnesota with his eight homer of the year and first since April 25 — yes, 19 weeks ago.\nMatt Wallner hit a towering shot for his 11th homer of the year an inning later.\nWallner's proved to be the game-winner as López held the Rays in check much of the day. The Rays got three hits and walk in the third to cut the Twins' lead in half, but he was otherwise strong again, notching his fifth consecutive quality start.\nLopez’s day ended after a two-out RBI double in the seventh brought the Rays within a run and led to a 10-minute umpires’ review because Wallner crashed over the wall and out of play.\nIt’s unclear what took so long, as Yandy Díaz was clearly not to first yet, but the delay led Twins manager to pull a clearly frustrated Lopez.\nGriffin Jax got out of the inning on one pitch, then came back and tossed a scoreless eighth. DaShawn Keirsey Jr., called up earlier in the day , made his MLB debut as a defensive sub in center in the eighth and got turned around on a deep fly ball off the bat of Christopher Morel that resulted in a triple. However, Jax fanned the next hitter to end the frame and Jhoan Duran tossed a clean ninth for the save.\nThe Twins now head to Kansas City for three against the Royals — Minnesota is currently 7-3 vs. KC this season. Zebby Matthews (1-2, 7.41 ERA) is slated to start for the Twins on Friday against lefty Cole Ragans (10-9, 3.46 ERA). First pitch is scheduled for 7:10 p.m.\nSep 5, 2024; St. Petersburg, Florida, USA; Minnesota Twins second baseman Edouard Julien (47) runs the bases after hitting a three-run home run against the Tampa Bay Rays in the second inning at Tropicana Field.
