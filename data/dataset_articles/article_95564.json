  "text": "By Jackson Naugle ,\n2 hours ago Former Oregon running back LaMichael James was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame Class of 2024 on Wednesday, joining former USC running back Reggie Bush and former Michigan State head coach Mark D'Antonio.\nUnlike Bush and D'Antonio, James made two appearances in Pasadena for the Rose Bowl, rushing 15 times for 70 yards against Ohio State in 2010, then 25 times for 159 yards and a touchdown against Wisconsin in 2012.\nOregon fans will remember the 2012 performance as the Ducks' first Rose Bowl victory since 1917, and while Darron Thomas and the passing game were integral to Oregon's win, so was James.\nJan 2, 2012; Pasadena, CA, USA; Oregon Ducks running back LaMichael James (21) reacts after the 2012 Rose Bowl game against the Wisconsin Badgers at the Rose Bowl. Oregon defeated Wisconsin 45-38. © Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\nThe 2010 Doak Walker Award winner averaged 5.7 yards per carry in his two Rose Bowl appearances while playing a major role in the Ducks' ascension to becoming a national title contender.\nMeanwhile, Reggie Bush made just one appearance in the Rose Bowl, recording 41 rushing yards, 42 receiving yards, 49 return yards and no touchdowns.\nD'Antonio also appeared in the Rose Bowl only once as head coach for Michigan State, earning a 24-20 victory over Stanford in 2014.\nWith solid numbers in his two separate appearances, James is certainly the most decorated Rose Bowl-er of the 2024 induction class.\nJames joined Danny O'Neil as the second Oregon player to make an appearance in the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame. O'Neil was inducted in 2003 following his performance in the 1995 Rose Bowl.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
