Facing another match against Argentina, they aim to build confidence before their upcoming battles with New Zealand. Coach Joe Schmidt faces hurdles with injuries but remains hopeful. [Devdiscourse News Desk](/devdiscourse-stories)| Updated: 06-09-2024 02:49 IST | Created: 06-09-2024 02:49 IST Australia's Wallabies secured a last-minute victory against Argentina in the Rugby Championship last weekend, breathing new life into a beleaguered team ahead of their upcoming confrontations with New Zealand. The win marked Australia's first success in this year's competition, offering a much-needed morale boost. In Santa Fe, Australia and Argentina are set to clash again this Saturday. Injuries have been a stumbling block for new coach Joe Schmidt, but he is optimistic about better performance in dry conditions. Last week's rainy weather challenged the team's attack strategy, but scrumhalf Jake Gordon noted the potential for improvement. Argentina, on the other hand, has been inconsistent. After stunning the All Blacks in Wellington, they fell short against Australia. Loose forward Marcos Kremer is looking forward to using this week as an opportunity for redemption. Hosting their first test in Santa Fe since 2018, the Pumas have a mixed home record against Australia. (With inputs from agencies.)
