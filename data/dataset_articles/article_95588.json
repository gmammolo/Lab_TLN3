  "text": "According to a report from ESPN's Adam Schefter, the Kansas City Chiefs and tight end Noah Gray agreed on a three-year, $18 million contract extension ahead of the team's season opener on Thursday night. The Chiefs selected Gray in the fifth round of the 2021 NFL draft out of Duke University, where he earned second-team All-ACC and second-team All-American honors. Now in his third year with Kansas City, the two-time Super Bowl champion is set to serve as a backup to All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce. With this extension, the Chiefs are committing to Gray for the long term, and will continue to lean on him when Kelce is on the sideline. Though Gray's new deal didn't break the bank for Kansas City's front office, Brett Veach's decision to lock him up for the next three years could prove to be important if injuries play a factor for the Chiefs at the tight end position. Expect Andy Reid to utilize Gray against the Baltimore Ravens on Thursday night as Kansas City looks to defend its newly won AFC Championship.",
