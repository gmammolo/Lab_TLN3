  "text": "Ava Colley’s football journey began with watching games on television and playing the sport on the weekends with her dad.\nThat quality time with her father, David, was always fun for Ava, and she enjoyed football so much that she decided to take it to the next level and play competitively growing up.\nFootball has always been male-dominated, and Colley wanted to prove otherwise.\n“Eventually, it just led to me wanting to prove that girls can play a sport,” Colley said. “Even if it isn’t meant for them.”\nColley started her football career in recreational leagues, but when she reached eighth grade, she was told eighth graders weren’t allowed to play at the rec level.\nColley had only one option — high school football.\n“I was like, ‘Well, I’m not going to give up my dream of playing football,’” Colley said. “So, I came up to the high school level, played [junior varsity], and I loved it — so I continued to play.”\nSure enough, through hard work and dedication to the sport that she loves, Colley, now a sophomore, has earned herself a spot as the long snapper on the Harrisonburg varsity football squad — the first girl football player for the Blue Streaks in program history.\n“When you can be the first to do anything, as long as it’s something good, it’s gotta be important,” HHS head coach Kyle Gillenwater said. “I know she put all the hours in and the sweat and everything to do it. She deserves an opportunity, and she’ll get one.”\nColley isn’t phased by being the only girl on a team.\nShe embraces it.\n“At this point, it’s just second nature,” Colley said. “I’ve done it my whole life since I could play tackle football. It’s just something that I love to do. I love my teammates. They accept me for it, and they help me whenever I need it.”\nOf course, it’s somewhat of a different dynamic among her teammates when talking to her compared to each other. Still, the camaraderie is there as Colley feels she’s treated no differently than any other player.\n“They still help me,” Colley said. “We still have good laughs and all that. It’s just something fun that we get to do, and it’s just a different experience for them. I think they enjoy having a different perspective of football.”\nBeing a long snapper is something Colley made herself into, Gillenwater said, adding that when she started this venture, she hadn’t been in the weight room much and wanted to take on a skill where it didn’t matter as much.\nEver since taking the position, Colley has thrived.\n“She snapped every day for about a year and a half, and she’s gotten pretty good at it,” Gillenwater said. “It was a skill she worked really hard to attain, and that’s how all that came to be.”\nGillenwater has welcomed Colley to the program with open arms.\nFrom day one, Colley said Gillenwater has been widely accessible, helping her with anything she needs and giving her a chance to showcase her talent.\n“He’s been really helpful this year,” Colley said. “He’s helped me take on more positions and given me the opportunities that he would the rest of the team, so that’s been nice. He’s given me the chance to go in the weight room during the offseason workouts so I can keep up with everyone else.”\nA former captain on the junior varsity team, Gillenwater said that’s translated to the varsity level as Colley is a leader and sets a quality example of how a player should conduct themselves.\n“She’s at everything we have — first one there, last one to leave,” Gillenwater said. “Effort is always there. She’s the ultimate teammate.”\nYou can’t replace people who don’t miss anything, Gillenwater said.\nThat’s the case with Colley, as Gillenwater said she’s well aware of everything going on with the HHS offense and could answer any question about it.\nAt times, Colley’s knowledge of the game has morphed her into an extension of the Streaks coaching staff.\n“She’s an additional coach on the field,” Gillenwater said. “There’s not much about what we do offensively that she doesn’t know. She studied that just like how she’s made herself a good player and a good long snapper.”\nThere’s no doubt Colley’s passion for football runs deep, and Gillenwater has seen it firsthand.\nIt’s evident to the dual-sport head coach how badly Colley wants to be a part of the Streaks program, and she’s rightfully earned the opportunity.\n“From the first time that I’ve met her, she’s had a goal to do this,” Gillenwater said. “She worked extremely hard to get there. When you get a player like that, you’ve got to love having them on the team and be a part of the program.”\nColley is a proven example of how you can be anything you want if you put your mind to it.\nSince those first days of seeing football on TV with her dad, Colley has put her mind towards football, and it’s paid off as she now takes the field alongside her Blue Streak teammates.\nNow, Colley hopes her story will help pave the way for more girls to get opportunities in the sport, adding that if they saw what she did, they could have it in their minds that they can do it, too.\n“That’s my ultimate goal of high school,” Colley said. “At least get some girls to believe in themselves that they can eventually end up coming up here and doing the same thing as me.”",
