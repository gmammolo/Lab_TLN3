  "text": "COLLEGE STATION, Texas – A freshman at Texas A&M is now $50,000 richer after nailing a field goal.\nLucas Dolibois, a first-year business major and lifelong Aggies fan, was picked out of a lottery to take part in ESPN’s ‘College GameDay’ pre-show.\nA segment in the show includes analyst Pat McAfee, a former kicker with the Indianapolis Colts, offering up big time cash if someone in the crowd can make a field goal.\nDolibois did just that.\nThe Houston native played soccer at Bellaire High School, but never had a more important kick in his life.\n“My hands are like, shaking,” he told KPRC 2′s Gage Goulding. “I was more nervous when I got selected than when I was taking the kick.”\nPat McAfee: “Now we got Lucas Doliboi here, who’s a freshman high school soccer player. Have you ever said anything terrible about a kicker before?”\nLucas Doliboi: “Horrible. Like kicking is so easy.”\nPat McAfee: “Why is that? Because you’re a high school soccer player.”\nLucas Doliboi: “Just like I could. I keep thinking I can make this. I can make this. I could go out right now [and] make a 45-yarder.”\nIt was big-time trash talk on national TV, the biggest stage for any kicker.\nPat McAfee: “All right, Lucas. Any final words before you shank one into somebody’s face?”\nLucas Doliboi: “Beat the hell out of Notre Dame.”\nHis kick... Well, it came up short.\nBut Aggieland wasn’t letting that go. And neither was Pat McAfee.\n“This one will be for $50,000,” McAfee said after crowds chated ‘One more time!’\nLucas got one more shot, double or nothing, and he NAILED it.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by College GameDay (@collegegameday)\n“I’m still, like, kind of on the high from it,” Dolibois said. “It’s it’s still crazy. Like, I’ll still have people come up to me and ask me, ‘Hey, are you the kicker?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, that’s me.’”\nNow with $50,000 hanging around in his bank account, the freshman has a plan with the money, and it’s not for college.\nHouston native Lucas Dolibois standing with ESPN's 'College GameDay' host Pat McAfee and comedian Shane Gillis after he kicked a field goal to win $50,000.

I think what we’re going to do is we’re going to put a lot of the money into a retirement or an investment fund and just kind of let the money grow over time.”\nAs for his future goals in life, this couldn’t be a better start to his college career.\nDolibois says he wants to work in the front office of a professional sports team.\n“I’m hoping that maybe I can parlay some of that into an internship or something at ESPN or something of the sorts, because that would really help me jumpstart that dream to becoming a sports business man and whatnot,” he said.\nCopyright 2024 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.",
