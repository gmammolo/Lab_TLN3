  "text": "REIGNING champion Kurashiki drubbed Farm Fresh 25-13, 25-16 25-16 yesterday for its second straight win in the PVL Invitational Conference at the PhilSports Arena in Pasig.\nMiddle blocker Cing Mei Low continued to sizzle for the Japanese-based club with 12 points, seven off attacks and four kill blocks while skipper Saya Taniguchi added 10 markers.\n“(We had a) good performance. Nalabas ng Ablaze iyong (aming) way of volleyball,” Ablaze coach Hideo Suzuki said through an interpreter.\n“Noong first set, maganda iyong performance ko. (Kapag may) hindi magandang set pero (nagagawan ng paraan) mapalo ng malakas kaya okay today,” Taniguchi added.\nIt was a mini reunion for Kurashiki after it faced on the other side its former deputy coach and ace player Shota Sato and Asaka Tamaru who now serve as the Foxies tactician and foreign guest player, respectively.\nThe Ablaze, who opened their title-retention bid last Wednesday with a 25-20, 25-18, 23-25, 25-21 triumph over Est Cola, gained the solo lead with a 2-0 mark.\nReinforced Conference’s Best Opposite Hitter Trisha Tubu and Tamaru scored nine and eight points, respectively, for Farm Fresh.",
