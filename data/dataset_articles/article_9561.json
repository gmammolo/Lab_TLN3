  "text": "ST. BERNARD PARISH, La. — St. Bernard Parish residents who may need help evacuating in case of a disaster are urged to sign up for assistance.\nOfficials said residents who sign up will be evacuated by the parish government at least 50 hours before a storm makes landfall.\n“If you do not have transportation, we need to know about it,” Parish President Louis Pomes said in a release.\nTo sign up, you will need to fill out a special needs registration form. If you signed up last year, you will need to sign up again and update any personal information that may have changed.\nWhat You Need to Know\n- In order to be eligible for this program you must process a valid ID or driver’s license. If you do not have a valid ID or driver’s license you will be processed by the St. Bernard Parish Sheriffs’ Office for identification purposes.\n- Parish categories for those with special needs\n- Residents who require a degree of medical care that exceeds that of general population, such as the disabled, the infirmed or those who are electrically dependent.\n- Residents who do not otherwise have transportation or resources to safely evacuate St. Bernard Parish\nPomes urges residents who need help to register with the Office of Homeland and Emergency Preparedness by calling 504-278-4268.\nRegister here.\n► Get breaking news from your neighborhood delivered directly to you by downloading the new FREE WWL-TV News app now in the IOS App Store or Google Play.",
