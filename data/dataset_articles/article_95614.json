The Trust Project What is this? ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Fresh off an ugly defensive game on Wednesday, and digesting tough injury news about Byron Buxton, who will be delayed in his return, and Max Kepler, who landed on the injured list, the Twins needed someone who could send them to Kansas City for a pivotal series against the Royals with some optimism.\nAnd who better than Pablo López?\nADVERTISEMENT\nLópez has looked every bit the ace in the second half of the season and on Thursday, he helped lead the Twins to a 4-3 win over the Tampa Bay Rays in the series finale at Tropicana Field.\nMORE MINNESOTA TWINS COVERAGE:\nPro Twins’ Byron Buxton’s return slowed, Max Kepler lands on injured list ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — On the eve of one of their most important series of the season — a three-game set against division foe Kansas City — the Twins announced that center fielder Byron Buxton felt hip discomfort while playing in a rehab game and Max Kepler needs a stint on the injured list. 6h ago · By Betsy Helfand / St. Paul Pioneer Press\nPro Defense, Louie Varland falter as Twins rattled by Rays Several miscues lead to eight runs off Louie Varland in fourth inning 1d ago · By Betsy Helfand / St. Paul Pioneer Press\nPro Twins start preparing Louie Varland for ‘different roles’ Right-hander was recalled from St. Paul on Wednesday to eat innings against the Rays in Tampa Bay 1d ago · By Betsy Helfand / St. Paul Pioneer Press\nPro Twins expand roster to 28, bring back Brooks Lee The turn of the calendar from August to September meant the return of two players who had been with the Twins earlier in the season. 1d ago · By Betsy Helfand / St. Paul Pioneer Press\nPro Starter David Festa continues to progress, but Twins fall to Rays David Festa gave up two runs in five innings pitched on Tuesday night 2d ago · By Betsy Helfand / St. Paul Pioneer Press\nPro Twins’ Trevor Larnach staying the course and thriving Trevor Larnach is having his most productive offensive season 2d ago · By Betsy Helfand / St. Paul Pioneer Press\nPro Twins beat Rays behind solid bullpen effort ST. PETERSBURG — The Twins’ bullpen has been reshaped in recent weeks, as they look to find the best group of arms to push them towards the playoffs. 3d ago · By Betsy Helfand / St. Paul Pioneer Press\nPro Royce Lewis’ late heroics lift Twins to victory over Blue Jays A nine-game homestand at Target Field looked like a prime opportunity for the Twins to reset in the comforts of their own ballpark as they make a push for the postseason. 4d ago · By Betsy Helfand / St. Paul Pioneer Press\nPro Blue Jays chase Matthews early in 15-0 rout The Twins rookie right-hander gave up nine runs on 10 hits in two innings 5d ago · By John Shipley / St. Paul Pioneer Press\nPro Twins’ Royce Lewis battling through first real hitting slump Always a productive hitter when healthy, the infielder is hitting .233 with an uncharacteristic .704 OPS in August 5d ago · By John Shipley / St. Paul Pioneer Press “The team picked me up plenty of times in the first half when I wasn’t at my best or my sharpest,” López said. “It’s one of those things that you have to take it personal. We were down in the series and I knew I had an opportunity to come out here and do it for my guys, for my teammates.”\nHis 23⅓-scoreless innings streak was broken in the third inning when he allowed a two-run single to top prospect Junior Caminero, but the right-hander featured some of his best stuff as the Twins (76-64) salvaged a split of the four-game series.\nLópez threw three different pitches above 98 mph, including one at 98.6 — the hardest pitch of his career. And his sweeper had a 70 percent whiff rate, accounting for seven of the 18 swinging strikes he racked up in the game.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“As well as he’s been throwing the ball, this may have been as good of a day with some of his best stuff we’ve seen literally in two years,” bench coach Jayce Tingler said.\nHe gave up just one other run in the game, in the seventh inning when Yandy Díaz doubled to right. Matt Wallner tracked down the ball and his momentum took him tumbling over the outfield wall.\nA lengthy rules review followed as the umpires figured out which base to place Díaz on. More than 10 minutes had passed, likely leading to the of López’s day as Griffin Jax was summoned to finish off the seventh inning.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLópez said he was a little frustrated because one of the few fastballs he yanked in the game went for a double and then the delay took much longer than he expected.\n“I was hoping to stay in the game after that, just to give me an opportunity to end on a better note by getting that last out,” López said. “But didn’t win that conversation. The best reliever in baseball came to get that last out.”\nThough he didn’t get that final 21st out that he was hoping for, it was yet again another promising start from López when his team needed him the most.\nAnd it comes as no surprise to those around him.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“We know how hard he works. We know how good his stuff is. It felt like it was just a tick off (earlier this season). I think we knew this was coming,” catcher Ryan Jeffers said. “He’s our ace. He’s been our ace. He’s one of the top pitchers in all of baseball and he’s showing that now.”\nThe Twins’ top starter pitched with the lead for much of the day as Edouard Julien stepped up offensively and hit his first major league home run since April 25 in the second inning, a three-run shot off Rays (69-71) starter Taj Bradley on a pitch left over the heart of the plate. Wallner hit a solo homer an inning later for a 4-0 lead the Rays were unable to overcome.\nWith the split, the injury-depleted Twins now travel to Kansas City, to face the Royals, on whom they have a half game advantage in the American League Central. Both teams are currently positioned to win a Wild Card berth.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“We all have a job to try to help the team win,” Julien said. “If everybody does that, I think we’re going to win some games. It (doesn’t) matter who it is. It’s the next man up.”",
