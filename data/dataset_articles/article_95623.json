  "text": "Balloon release returns to Memorial Stadium for Nebraska vs. Colorado game LINCOLN, Neb. (KOLN) - The balloon release tradition will return to Memorial Stadium for the highly anticipated Nebraska vs. Colorado game. The tradition, which dates back to the 1960s, had faced criticism over environmental concerns and was ultimately [halted in 2022](https://www.1011now.com/2022/05/23/nebraska-athletic-director-says-fans-will-not-be-given-balloons-inside-memorial-stadium-2022-football-season/) due to a helium shortage. “As we celebrate the rich tradition between the two schools and honor our 1994 national championship team, Nebraska Athletics will bring back a Memorial Stadium tradition of releasing balloons after the Huskers’ first touchdown,” Nebraska Athletics announced Thursday. Red balloons will be distributed free of charge by Husker Athletics staff in and around Memorial Stadium. However, the university clarified that the balloon release will not occur at every game but will be reserved for “select special occasions.” Athletic Director Troy Dannen hinted at the return of the balloon release on Aug. 31 with a cryptic post on X (formerly Twitter) of just a red balloon.
