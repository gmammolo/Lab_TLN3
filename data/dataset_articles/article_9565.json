  "text": "Emergency crews rescue 31 after Los Angeles tunnel collapse\nA wastewater management tunnel under construction collapsed in Wilmington, Los Angeles trapping 27 workers underground. Four other workers went in after the collapse to try to help their colleagues, according to BBC's reporting partner, CBSNews. All 31 workers were rescued safely after roughly an hour, thanks to over 100 emergency responders. No injuries were reported. The project is now on hold pending investigation. LA Mayor Karen Bass met with some of the men once they were above ground.",
