  "text": "That UTEP game was fun, but we've had this one circled for a while. Old border rivals Nebraska and Colorado under the lights at Memorial Stadium, on an NBC broadcast? We can do that. GAME PICKS Which of the two quarterbacks, Dylan Raiola or Shedeur Sanders, has a better day? Amie Just, columnist: Sanders has more yards, but Raiola has more overall success. Luke Mullin, reporter: To quote linebacker Mikai Gbayor, “you can’t compare Dylan to Shedeur Sanders.” Give me Sanders, though, as the veteran who's been in this moment before. Nate Head, sports editor: Raiola makes a mistake early — either a turnover or a big miss — but then is cool and collected the rest of the way. Sanders puts up big numbers, including sacks taken. People are also reading… Colton Stone, digital sports editor: Raiola will have a cleaner night, even if Sanders racks up the stats. Who leads Nebraska in rushing? Just: Emmett Johnson. Mullin: Dante Dowdell, shaking off last week's fumble, resumes his role as NU's lead back. Head: Rahmir Johnson. Matt Rhule mentioned him by name Thursday. The four-back rotation can't continue forever. Stone: The running back that doesn't fumble. So let's say Emmett Johnson. How many times will Nebraska sack Shedeur Sanders? Just: Five, with a few tackles for loss outside of the pocket. Mullin: Five, with Ty Robinson accounting for two of those sacks. Head: Let's say seven. Nebraska's front is going to be energized by the crowd, and get after the QB early and often. I'd love to see James \"Sack Man\" Williams get in on one. Stone: Returning Huskers accounted for 3½ of last season's eight sacks; I think they manage six this time around. What big play or decision will everyone be talking about on Sunday? Just: A 73-yard Dylan Raiola to Jahmal Banks touchdown. Mullin: Tommi Hill outplaying Travis Hunter at cornerback. Head: I think we'll see Nebraska score a touchdown on defense or special teams. I lean special teams — Jacory Barney looked awfully slippery in Week 1. Stone: NU chooses to go for it on fourth down, late in the second quarter, to punch in a TD instead of settling for a field goal. OVER/UNDERS Dylan Raiola pass yards — 245.5 Just: Over. Mullin: Over. Head: Under. Stone: Over. Travis Hunter receiving yards: 85.5 Just: Over. Mullin: Over. Head: Over. Stone: Under. Isaiah Neyor receiving yards: 58.5 Just: Over. Mullin: Over. Head: Under. Stone: Over. Shedeur Sanders pass yards: 309.5 Just: Under. Mullin: Under. Head: Over. Stone: Over. Rahmir Johnson rushing yards: 36.5 Just: Under. Mullin: Over. Head: Over. Stone: Over.",
