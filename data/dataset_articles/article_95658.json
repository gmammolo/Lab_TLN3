  "text": "TNA Wrestling reached an agreement with Sportsnet in Canada to start 2025, putting TNA iMPACT! on Sportsnet 360.\nSportsnet is Canada’s number one sports network, putting TNA in more homes than ever in Canada.\nSpeaking on Reffin' It Up, Brian Myers was asked if the deal with Sportsnet would open the door for more deals across the world.\n\"That, I think, is the plan. Without knowing, I think that would be the ultimate goal. I’ve been part of TNA for over four years now, and the roster is so hard-working and so passionate, and I think the show is so different than the other big two companies per se that you might see on television. I think it offers something really different for a real wrestling fan. So that’s what I hope for, more eyes on the product,\" he said.\nIn the United States, TNA is available on YouTube to TNA+ subscribers and on AXS TV.\nAsked if a better TV deal would take TNA to the next level, Myers replied, “I 100% believe that. I think, whether it’s a streaming service or a cable channel that is in more homes, that’s the missing piece. Because the talent’s there, the passion’s there, the roster’s there. Even the shit Eric Tompkins does behind the scenes, making us all look cooler than we really are with the packages and the vignettes, it’s all there. It’s just a matter of eyeballs, and I think that’s the move.\"\nWWE Raw moved off cable television in 2025 and onto Netflix, opening up a new world of potential viewers.\nSpeaking on the WWE Raw on Netflix premiere, Myers said, \"I was just like, man, this feels big. This feels bigger than wrestling. That was the first time I was like, damn, man. This is different. But it’s still wrestling. So it’s like that money is gonna roll downhill and hopefully land in TNA’s lap [laughs], and we can do something ourselves on a streaming platform.\"\nElsewhere during the interview, Myers commented on talent leaving TNA.
