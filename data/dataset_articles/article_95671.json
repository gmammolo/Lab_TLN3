  "text": "BENNINGTON — The small-but-mighty Mount Anthony swim teams continued their season Wednesday with a home meet against Wahconah.\nThe Patriots girls grinded out an 85-81 victory despite having only six swimmers to Wahconah’s 15. The MAU boys, outmanned 12-6, lost a tightly contested meet 81-79.\nGIRLS\nMAU won all but one of the 11 events, as Wahconah’s Emily Capoana swam to a victory in the 100 breaststroke with her time of 1:27.70, besting MAU’s Avery Camarda (1:28.86) by a second.\nCamarda did record her victory in her only other individual event, the 200 individual medley (2:47.57), a full seven seconds ahead of the closest Warrior.\nEmily Tibbetts (100 yard freestyle, 100 yard backstroke) and Lucy Poole (50 yard freestyle, 100 yard butterfly) won both of their individual events, while Olivia Crandall (200 yard freestyle) and Lucy Driscoll (500 yard freestyle) picked up one individual win.\nThe Patriots also benefited from winning all three relays. Nollyn Blair, Camarda, Poole and Tibbets teamed up to win the 200 medley relay by 11 seconds. It was Camarda, Crandall, Driscoll and Poole swimming to a nine-second win in the 200 yard freestyle relay while Blair, Driscoll, Crandall and Tibbetts took the 400 yard freestyle relay by a comfortable 24 seconds.\nBOYS\nMAU secured nine victories out of the 11-event meet, with the Warriors’ Artois Sancho claiming victory in the 50 yard freestyle and Kalen Spratt besting the field in the 100 yard backstroke.\nThe Patriots were led by Nixon Lebert and Braeden McManus, who each played a part in four of the victories. Lebert won both the 100 and 200 yard freestyle races, and was a part of MAU’s 200 medley and 400 freestyle relay teams.\nMcManus grabbed his individual wins in the 100 yard butterfly and the 200 individual medley, and also swam on the 200 medley relay team – along with Keegan Avienu and James Tock. McManus was also on the winning 200 freestyle relay team, along with Colin Joyce, Dan Wellspeak and Avienu.\nWellspeak added to the Patriots’ team score with his win in the 500 yard freestyle, as did Tock with a victory in the 100 yard breaststroke.\nBoth MAU teams are now 6-2 on the season as they prepare for Friday’s senior meet against Monument Mountain.",
