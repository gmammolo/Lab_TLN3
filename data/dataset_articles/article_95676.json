  "text": "Table of Contents\nWaqar Salamkheil produced a moment of magic in the International League (IL)T20 2025 match between MI Emirates and Desert Vipers, dismissing the dangerous Alex Hales with the beauty of a delivery.\nWaqar Salamkheil dismantles Alex Hales with a stunning delivery\nBowling the very first ball of his spell, Salamkheil unleashed a mesmerizing leg-break that was nothing short of a masterclass in spin bowling. The delivery landed on a good length just outside off stump, gripping the surface with precision and fizzing through the air. Hales, who had been batting fluently, completely misjudged the trajectory and spin. Expecting less turn, he left an expansive gap between his bat and pad, creating an inviting pathway for the ball. With sharp deviation off the pitch, the ball zipped through the gap, clipped the top of the middle stump, and sent it cartwheeling. The sheer artistry of the delivery left Hales visibly stunned and underlined Waqar’s ability to deceive even the most accomplished batters with his guile and control.\nThis dismissal broke the Vipers’ strong opening stand of 62 runs and provided Emirates with a crucial breakthrough. Hales’ quickfire knock of 34 off 22 balls, including six boundaries, was pivotal for the Vipers’ aggressive start, but Waqar’s brilliance brought it to an end. It was a perfect example of a bowler outwitting a set batter with skill and precision.\nHere’s the video:\nAbsolute 𝙥𝙚𝙖𝙘𝙝 🤩\n[#ILT20onZee][#T20HeroesKaJalwa][#DPWorldILT20][#DVvMIE][pic.twitter.com/FtV1tpWcb3]— Zee Cricket (@ilt20onzee)\n[January 16, 2025]\nAlso WATCH: Adam Milne’s destructive bowling shatters the stumps of Phil Salt and Kyle Mayers in ILT20 2025\nDesert Vipers outshine MI Emirates: Fakhar Zaman’s remarkable knock\nIn a closely contested match at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, The Vipers secured a commanding 5-wicket victory over the Emirates with five balls to spare. Chasing a target of 160, Fakhar Zaman anchored the innings with a brilliant 67 off 52 balls, striking 5 fours and 4 sixes. Hales gave a brisk start with a 22-ball 34, adding 62 runs for the first wicket with Fakhar. Though Emirates fought back with timely wickets, Sam Curran‘s 28 and Sherfane Rutherford‘s explosive 21 off just 8 balls sealed the win. Earlier, the Emirates posted 159/6, with Kieron Pollard top-scoring with a 23-ball 36. Lockie Ferguson was the pick of the bowlers for Vipers, claiming 2 wickets for 25 runs. The victory kept Vipers unbeaten in the tournament and cemented their position at the top of the points table.",
