  "text": "In an exciting moment during Match 10 of the SA20 2025 tournament between Joburg Super Kings and Pretoria Capitals, Donovan Ferreira delivered a fielding masterclass with a breathtaking “Superman-esque” catch.\nDonovan Ferreira’s stunning catch in SA20 2025\nWith Pretoria reeling at 131/8 in the 20th over, Senuran Muthusamy looked to counterattack by launching a length delivery from Hardus Viljoen straight down the ground. The shot seemed destined to clear the fielder, with just enough height and power to evade any attempt. However, Donovan Ferreira had other plans. In a moment of sheer brilliance, Ferreira anticipated the trajectory, turned sharply, and executed an extraordinary leap, extending his hand mid-air to snatch the ball with precision. This exceptional display of athleticism not only dismissed Muthusamy for 8 but also highlighted the pivotal role of sharp fielding in T20 cricket. Ferreira’s moment of brilliance left fans and commentators in awe, emphasizing the impact of game-changing efforts in tight contests.\nHere’s the video:\nJoburg Super Kings +Spectacular One-handed catches = same whatsapp group 🤞\n[#BetwaySA20][#JSKvPC][#WelcomeToIncredible][pic.twitter.com/oVZ9TFYxEH]— Betway SA20 (@SA20_League)\n[January 16, 2025]\nAlso WATCH: Dinesh Karthik’s innings cut short by a bizarre run-out in SA20 2025\nRain-interrupted as Pretoria Capitals post 138/8 against Joburg Super Kings\nThe 10th match at The Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, saw an eventful first innings After opting to bat, Capitals faced early setbacks with Rahmanullah Gurbaz dismissed for a duck and Will Jacks falling for 15, reducing them to 48/2 within six overs. Kyle Verreynne anchored the innings with a well-crafted 39 off 31 balls, but his dismissal just before the halfway mark triggered a middle-order collapse.\nRilee Rossouw, Liam Livingstone and Marques Ackerman struggled against disciplined bowling led by Moeen Ali, who claimed 2/21 in his four overs. Ferreira’s all-round brilliance shone through as he dismissed Gurbaz and Neesham, while also taking a spectacular catch to remove Muthusamy in the penultimate over. James Neesham’s quickfire 30 off 21 provided a late surge, helping the Capitals reach a modest total of 138/8. The Super Kings’ bowlers, including Imran Tahir (1/17) and Evan Jones (1/3), exploited the conditions effectively, keeping the scoring rate in check throughout. As rain continues to hover, the Super Kings will eye a controlled chase to secure their campaign momentum.",
