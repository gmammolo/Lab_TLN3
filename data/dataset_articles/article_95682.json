  "text": "Man Windsurfs 4,100 Km Across the Atlantic Setting Record Time\nOn January 5, 2024, Oliver DeFranc, a 55-year-old adventurer from French Guiana, completed an extraordinary 4,100-kilometer solo windsurfing journey across the Atlantic. Starting from Senegal, he reached French Guiana in just 26 days and 8 hours, smashing the previous record by over 11 days.\nInspired by a Legend\nDeFranc’s feat was inspired by Christian Marty, the first person to windsurf across the Atlantic in 1982. As a teenager, DeFranc witnessed Marty’s historic arrival in Kourou, sparking a lifelong passion for windsurfing and a dream to replicate his hero’s journey. For context, Marty completed the journey in 37 days and 16 hours.\nOvercoming Challenges\nBeginning on December 10, 2023, DeFranc faced immense physical and mental challenges. He slept in short bursts using a stabilizing tube around his board and battled tendonitis, cramps, and exhaustion. Unlike Marty, he was supported by a safety crew on a catamaran, who provided food and gear daily. Even with decades of windsurfing experience, the journey pushed his limits.\nA Dream Fulfilled\nDeFranc’s arrival in Kourou was met with cheers from friends, classmates, and Jerome Marty, Christian Marty’s son. “I realized my 40-year dream,” DeFranc said. “It’s priceless. Windsurfing for me is over.”\nThis record-breaking journey honors Christian Marty’s legacy and showcases the resilience of the human spirit, an inspiration to adventurers around the world.",
