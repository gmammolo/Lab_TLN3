  "text": "Jennie Candlish is a dual-purpose trainer based in Staffordshire. Her run of form under both codes has been impressive recently have ended 2024 with a winner and starting 2025 with one too. Candlish took some time out of training winners to answer our questions.\nWhat made you happiest in 2024?\nHaving such happy horses and seeing the yard making such amazing progress, rewarding my wonderful team for all the hard work we all put in.\nHow do you start your day?\nMy day starts at 4:45 a.m., seven days a week. I always feed the horses their breakfast, it's a really lovely time of day. This is followed by a huge cup of coffee!\nWhat is the best thing about your job?\nBeing surrounded by horses each and every day. From a little girl this was my dream, so to be so fortunate to be living it really is a dream come true.\nIf you could only listen to one song for the rest of your life what would be?\nDreamers by Loredana, my late mother used to tell me to play it as it reminded her of me.\nIs there a horse you wish you had bought in 2024?\nJeannot Lapin (Fr) at £3,000 looks extremely well bought. A giant son of Doctor Dino (Fr) placed in two Irish Point-to-Points from three runs.\nRacehorse of 2024 and why?\nKyprios (Ire). Considering he was beaten in both starts in 2023, he returned to his best winning all seven starts including four Group 1s in 2024 and no horse got within under one length of him.\nDark horse for the year ahead?\nGeorge Scott's 3yo gelding West Acre (Ire) stepped up from winning all-weather novices to running a massive race in Dubai last week. He looks like a sprinter to follow.\nValue stallion for 2025?\nGhaiyyath (Ire) at €20k looks value especially with some proper potential three-year-olds Mandanaba (Fr), Gethin (Ire), Alobayyah (GB) and Rhapsody (Ire).\nWhat would make 2025 a good year for you?\nTo continue the growth of the yard, with a happy team of horses, staff and owners. And to keep making everyone who supports me proud.\nWhat is your motto for life?\nIf you do what you love then you'll never do a day's work in your life.\nTreat everyone with respect. Always be open and honest and treat everyone as you would expect to be treated yourself.",
