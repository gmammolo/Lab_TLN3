  "text": "Bayern Munich followed up their tricky 1-0 win over Borussia Mönchengladbach with an absolute routing of Hoffenheim at the Allianz Arena, winning by five goals to nil. A brace from Leroy Sané led the charge for the Rekordmeister and the other three goals were provided by Harry Kane (penalty), Raphaël Guerreiro, and Serge Gnabry.\nIt was exactly what the doctor order for Vincent Kompany, especially after Bayer Leverkusen had once again reduced Bayern’s gap at the top of the Bundesliga table to just one point with their 1-0 win over Mainz just one day prior to Bayern’s demolition of Hoffenheim. The gap is now back to four points.\nAfter receiving a fair amount of criticism for missing the open goal attempt in the second half of the draw at Gladbach, Leroy Sané looked like his old self against Hoffenheim and was well-deserving of the pair of goals he scored. He can often times really be a confidence-type player, but against Hoffenheim he was certainly on the right end of that scale after looking a bit short of it over the weekend.\nDespite his standout performance, the winger attributed the three points to the overall team performance, taking attention away from his own exploits during proceedings before he was subbed off in the 67th minute for Michael Olise. “The most important thing for me is to help the team. We have to keep it up. The first half of the season is now done, we’re having fun on the pitch - I think the fans can see that. We know what our strengths are and we have to keep showing them on the pitch,” the winger explained after the final whistle had blown (via @iMiaSanMia).\nPersonally for Sané, he has now tallied seven goals and one assist from his 21 appearances across all competitions, which, for his standards by this stage, is nothing special, but he was returning from an ongoing pubic bone injury that required surgery after the EUROs with Germany this past summer. It has taken him a while to hit form, but consistency will be the key for him and what Kompany will be hoping for. If Sané can continue to perform like he did in the Hoffenheim win, he will certainly be giving Kompany difficult selection decisions in attack with his starting lineups.\nLooking for more commentary and analysis of Bayern Munich’s 5-0 bashing of Hoffenheim?
