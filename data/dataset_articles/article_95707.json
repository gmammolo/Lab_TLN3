Thanks in part to his production, Notre Dame’s defense ranks No. 9 in the country in total yards allowed per game (298.3), No. 2 in passing yards allowed (165.3), and No. 2 in points allowed (14.3). The team that’s No. 1 in all of those categories? The Buckeyes, Notre Dame’s opponent in the national title tilt.”\nFor more inspiring sports stories, check out Sports Spectrum .\nBut Gray isn’t focused on his stats. Instead, he is set on glorifying God.\n“I believe in the path that God gave us and I believe in the path that we’re on,” Gray said in an interview with Access the Walk about God’s purpose for his team this season.\nREAD MORE: NOTRE DAME QB PRAISES GOD FOR ‘DREAM COME TRUE’ SUGAR BOWL WIN\n“We’re human, and sometimes we sin. And just confess to Him…You gotta study [the Bible], you gotta read, you gotta do everything right in the name of the Lord so you could live by Him and be a bridge for others so they can come close to Him,” he added.\nGray also reflected on the moment he gave his life to Jesus.\n“I just hear in my heart and in my mind, like, ‘This is you. Give glory to God. Give glory to God.’ All I hear is that,” he explained . “I felt it in my spirit. I felt whole. I felt warm. I felt like somebody was holding me. And I just keep hearing it. I start crying out of nowhere, and I’m just looking up to God, saying, ‘Thank You, God. I surrender, I surrender, I surrender.’”\nREAD MORE: NOTRE DAME QB KEEPS ‘RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS’ AT THE CENTER",
