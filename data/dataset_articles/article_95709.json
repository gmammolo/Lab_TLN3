  "text": "By Brad Harvey ,\n2 hours ago The Kentucky Wildcats’ 2025 transfer portal class is shaping up to be a strong one. With 18 incoming transfers, the team is making significant moves to bolster its roster.\nKey Additions Mi’Quise Grace: A four-star recruit and FCS All-American EDGE from South Dakota, who chose Kentucky over Mississippi State, USC, and Georgia.\nDavid Gusta: A defensive lineman from Washington State, ranked No. 151 in the transfer portal.\nJosh Braun: An interior offensive lineman with experience from Florida and Arkansas.\nSam Greene: An EDGE rusher from USC.\nLandyn Watson: A linebacker from Marshall.\nKentucky football’s wide receiver transfer portal class is looking promising, with several key additions as well.\nWide Receiver Additions Kendrick Law: A blue-chip prospect from Alabama who never quite lived up to expectations, but brings valuable experience to the table.\nJ.J. Hester: A veteran receiver from Missouri who had a productive year in 2021 under their wide receivers coach Bush Hamdan (who is now Kentucky Offensive Coordinator).\nTru Edwards: A seasoned wideout from Louisiana Tech who brings a strong track record, including 166 career receptions and a first-team All-CUSA selection.\nTroy Stellato: A transfer from Clemson, adding depth to the Wildcats’ receiving corps.\nThese additions have been guided by new wide receivers coach L’Damian Washington, who’s already making an impact on the recruiting trail. With Washington’s expertise and these new transfers, the Wildcats are looking to revamp their wide receiver room after some key losses transferring out.\nKentucky Football Full Transfer Portal Class Quarterbacks – Zach Calzada (Texas A&M/Auburn/Incarnate Word)\nRunning Backs – Dante Dowdell (Oregon/Nebraska)\nWide Receivers – J.J. Hester (Missouri/Oklahoma) – Kendrick Law (Alabama) – Troy Stellato (Clemson) – Tru Edwards (Louisiana Tech)\nTight Ends – Henry Boyer (Illinois)\nOffensive Linemen – Alex Wollschlaeger (Bowling Green) – Wallace Unamba (Florida Atlantic/New Mexico) – Joshua Braun (Florida/Arkansas) – Evan Wibberley (WKU)\nDefensive Linemen – Jaden Williams (Wyoming) – David Gusta (Washington State)\nLinebackers – Landyn Watson (TCU/Marshall)\nDefensive Backs – Kevis Thomas (Maryland)\nEdge Rushers – Sam Greene (USC) – Kameron Olds (Buffalo/Kent State) – Mi’Quise Grace (South Dakota)\nWhat It Means These additions address key needs for the Wildcats, including defensive line, edge rusher, and interior offensive line. 24/7 Sports has the class ranked seventh overall and fourth in the SEC to this point. The Wildcats are still in the running to add a highly rated left tackle, a cornerback, and possibly 1-2 others to the class.\nAfter last year’s disappointing 4-8 season, it is going to take seeing how the class translates on the field in the SEC. While good on paper, it doesn’t always mean the talent will make a strong push to compete near the top in the SEC.\nSubscribe to College SportsCast for fun, original college sports shows.
