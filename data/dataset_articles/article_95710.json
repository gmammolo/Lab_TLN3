  "text": "Notre Dame asks fans to wear green for national championship game\nSOUTH BEND, Ind. (WNDU) - If you’re a Notre Dame fan who is heading to Atlanta to watch the Irish football team play in the national championship game next week, you’re being told to pack green.\nThe university’s athletic department is asking fans to “Paint Atlanta Green” in support of the team.\nIt’s unclear at this time if this means the team will wear green jerseys for Monday’s championship matchup against the Ohio State Buckeyes.\nSince Marcus Freeman has taken over as head coach, the Irish have worn green jerseys once a year for one of their home games.\nThey were wearing green when they last played Ohio State in 2023. That game ended in a heartbreaker for the Irish as the Buckeyes scored a game-winning touchdown in the game’s final seconds.\nThe team’s green jersey game this season was back on Sept. 28 against Louisville. The 16th-ranked Irish knocked off the 15th-ranked Cardinals 31-24.\nKickoff for Monday night’s national championship game between the Irish and the Buckeyes at Mercedes-Benz Stadium is set for 7:30 p.m. on EST.\nCopyright 2025 WNDU.
