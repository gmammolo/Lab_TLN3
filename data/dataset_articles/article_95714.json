  "text": "The Minnesota Timberwolves removed Mike Conley from their starting lineup ahead of their game against the New Orleans Pelicans on Jan. 7. Chris Finch said they made the change to maximize Conley’s game. The veteran guard has struggled to find consistency this season but remains a trusted figure on this team.\nThe change has brought mixed results for Conley, but that hasn’t been the case for Donte DiVincenzo.\nDiVincenzo, 27, is averaging 18 points, five assists, and five rebounds in the five games since they promoted him into the starting lineup. He’s been productive and is finally starting to look like the player Timberwolves fans hoped they were getting in the Karl-Anthony Towns trade.\nEarlier in the season, the former Villanova guard wasn’t shooting well enough to space the floor for Minnesota. His three-point shot wasn’t falling, and he didn’t seem as assertive as he was with the New York Knicks. However, DiVincenzo has started to hit his stride when the team needs it. Before the Wolves added him to the starting unit, he was becoming a dependable piece and stayed on the court late in close games.\nThe change hasn’t only benefited DiVincenzo. The Wolves have won three of their last five games, and two of the losses against the Memphis Grizzlies and Golden State Warriors were winnable games, to say the least. The offense looks much better because it showcases more than Anthony Edwards and Julius Randle’s individual brilliance. The Wolves are also ninth in offensive rating in these five games, unlike where they’ve been for most of the season, hovering around league average.\nDiVincenzo has played well off the catch and the dribble. He’s understood how to play with Rudy Gobert all season, and that chemistry has manifested later in the season. DiVincenzo has used the effectiveness of Gobert’s screens to find openings for himself, and it’s made the Wolves much more potent offensively.\nEdwards recently expressed his frustration with the double teams he’s been facing. It’s a smart strategy, especially if it frustrates a player as talented as Ant. However, DiVincenzo’s shooting can make opponents second-guess their decision to send those double teams.\nThere was a sequence in Wednesday night’s games against the Golden State Warriors where DiVincenzo found himself wide open for three as Buddy Hield and Gary Payton Jr. miscommunicated on a defensive assignment where they both went to guard Edwards. DiVincenzo made the shot, and the Warriors immediately realized their strategy had to change.\nLate in the game, Golden State defended DiVincenzo intensely, leading to better offense for the Timberwolves. That’s how this team can improve offensively, and the numbers suggest they’re well on their way to doing that. After the game, Finch complimented DiVincenzo for his contributions after he finished with 28 points, nine assists, and six rebounds.\nAs Finch alluded to in his postgame comments, DiVincenzo has been just as important to the team’s defense. He’s brought a level of tenacity that shows in how he competes during every possession.\nI saw this live in the Los Angeles Clippers game on Jan. 5, immediately before the lineup change. Finch had DiVincenzo guarding James Harden late in the game, which is still challenging, even though he’s 35. DiVincenzo stayed disciplined as Harden showcased his dynamic handle, and the possession ended with a low-percentage shot.\nPlays like this exemplify what DiVincenzo’s brought to the Wolves lately. One must hope his production only continues to grow.",
