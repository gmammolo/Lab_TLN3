  "text": "Throughout John Cena’s career he’s faced off against a number of big names. At WrestleMania 21 he stepped into the ring with JBL, and Cena managed to defeat JBL to win the WWE Championship for the first time in his career.\nJBL discussed working with Cena during his formative years on Something to Wrestle , and he praised John for the hard work he’s put in. Layfield also noted that it’s unlikely to happen, but stated that he would like “one more crack” at the 16 time WWE World Champion.\n“I was so happy that I was part of John’s formative career. And again, I don’t take any credit for anything John did. John would be exactly where he is now, with or without me. I’m just glad that I was one of the ones that was there at the start. But John’s such a great guy. Everything about him…the more you know about John, from his Make-A-Wish, what he does, to how he interacts with fans, to how he interacts with talent, what he’s done with talent, it’s just amazing. So yeah, of course [I’d like one more crack at him].”\nIt’s been confirmed that JBL will be making an appearance on Monday Night Raw next week. John Cena is not currently being advertised for the show, but it will be interesting to see if JBL and Cena cross paths on WWE programming before Cena retires for good.\nH/T Wrestling Inc.",
