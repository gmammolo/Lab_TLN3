  "text": "The Detroit Lions will soon make franchise history by playing their first playoff game as the No. 1 seed. Injured stars David Montgomery and Terrion Arnold won't be sitting out for this one against the Washington Commanders.\nThe running back Montgomery and the cornerback Arnold are “off the injury report” and “good to go” ahead of Saturday, per NFL Network insider Tom Pelissero on Thursday. That's welcoming news for a Lions team seeking their first Super Bowl appearance.\nMontgomery dealt with a knee ailment in Week 15. An MRI scan revealed the veteran back had an MCL issue. But he competed as a full participant in practice Wednesday, according to Pelissero.\nArnold left Week 18 with a foot ailment. His Lions managed to trounce the Minnesota Vikings to clinch both the NFC North title and lock up the conference's top seed. Both now bolster Detroit's depth ahead of the Commanders showdown.\nHow effective are David Montgomery and Terrion Arnold for Lions?\nThe 15-2 Lions are equipped with a plethora of star power for the playoffs. Quarterback Jared Goff is garnering Most Valuable Player attention, wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown is an established Pro Bowler, even Sam LaPorta made history at tight end.\nMontgomery and Arnold, however, are their own stars in the Motor City. The 27-year-old Montgomery nearly matched his previous career-best total of 13 rushing touchdowns this season — scoring 12 in 15 games. He delivered two multiple touchdown afternoons against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Nov. 17, then versus the Dallas Cowboys on Oct. 13. Montgomery accomplished those marks in splitting carries with 1m412-yard rusher Jahmyr Gibbs.\nArnold established himself as one of the league's rising young talents at cornerback. The rookie first round selection tallied 47 tackles and swatted 10 passes. He also produced 47 solo tackles. Arnold also surrendered only 55.6% completions his side.\nThe former Alabama star is likely crossing paths with the Commanders' top target Terry McLaurin — who topped 1,000 receiving yards for the fifth straight season. McLaurin caught seven passes for 89 yards and scored a late touchdown in Washington's 23-20 Wild Card win on Sunday night. Meanwhile, the Lions-Commanders playoff game is already shattering records for ticket sell prices. The winner advances to the NFC title game against whoever wins the Sunday matchup between the Los Angeles Rams and Philadelphia Eagles.",
