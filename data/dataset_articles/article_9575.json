  "text": "In response to the devastating flash flooding in central Texas, many are looking for ways to get and give help. And scammers are looking to prey on people’s generosity. So how can you make sure your donations go to the people who need them and not to a scammer?\n- Donate to charities you know and trust with a proven track record of dealing with disasters.\n- Before you give, research the charity yourself — especially if the donation request comes on social media. Check out the charity on the Better Business Bureau’s\nGive.org, orCharity Watch. Find out exactly how much of your donation will go directly to the people the charity says it helps. - Don’t donate to anyone who insists you must pay by cash, gift card, wiring money, or cryptocurrency. That’s how scammers tell you to pay. If you decide to donate, paying by credit card gives you more protections.\n- Be cautious about giving to individuals on\ncrowdfunding sites. Know that money raised in a crowdfunding campaign goes to the campaign organizer, not directly to the people or cause it’s set up to help. Review the platform’s policies — does it take measures to verify postings that ask for help after a disaster? And know that donating via crowdfunding is not tax deductible. - Confirm the number before you text to donate. If someone asks you to donate by text, call the number on the charity’s website to confirm you have the right number to donate by text.\nTo learn more about how to donate safely, go to ftc.gov/charity. For advice to help you prepare for, deal with, and recover from weather emergencies and the scams that follow, check out ftc.gov/weatheremergencies.",
