  "text": "If Hell To Pay defies betting and wins Friday night's Magic Millions 3YO Guineas (1400m) , part-owner Jack Gardiner and three of his closest childhood mates will have 25 select words to thank for it.\nBack in 2022, Gardiner threw his hat into the ring for a competition run by TAB where the prize was a $50,000 buy into a yearling purchased by Champion Thoroughbreds at the 2023 Magic Millions Sales.\n\"You had to, in 25 words or less, explain why your punting club was the best,\" Gardiner said.\nFIELDS AND FORM GOLD COAST SATURDAY\n\"I entered and a couple of weeks later I got a call to say we'd won, I was blown away!\nHell To Pay winning on the Sunshine Coast on January 4 Picture: Grant Peters\n\"I run a Bakery Shop at Regents Park so I decided to play the ingredients angle for something a bit different and entered with … ‘Ingredients: Banter and love of horse racing. Method: Mix hope and optimism sparingly with a dash of humility. Cook weekly until the memories are golden!'\n\"They're 25 words, myself and my mates Ben Austin, Peter Hilton and Ben Ramsey won't forget in a hurry. Regardless of where he finishes, he's giving us a great ride already.\n\"I went a bit of a different way and it paid off.\"\nAfter learning about all the trials and tribulations that come with a high octane sales ring on the run, Gardiner and his group of mates ended up partnering with a then Hellbent x Sugar Hill colt that was knocked down to Champion Thoroughbreds for $280,000.\nNow a gelding and racing as Hell To Pay, he has started five times, finishing third on four straight occasions before breaking through for his maiden victory last start on the Sunshine Coast.\n\"We've been to all of his starts regardless of where they have been – it's been such a great experience,\" Gardiner said.\n\"We can't thank TAB and Champion Thoroughbreds enough, the more people that can experience something like this the better for racing.\n\"And when you share it with friends you've grown up with it makes it even better.\"\nHell To Pay , trained by John O'Shea and Tom Charlton, is $41 in betting for Friday night's Guineas with top Victorian hoop Damian Lane in the saddle.\nHell To Pay as a yearling.\nAnd in another move that can have you believing that the stars are aligning, it is sheer fortune, and unfortunately misfortune for others, that the up and coming type will take his place in the feature event at all.\n• PUNT LIKE A PRO : Become a Racenet iQ member and get expert tips – with fully transparent return on investment statistics – from Racenet's team of professional punters at our Pro Tips section. SUBSCRIBE NOW !\nPerched as first emergency, Hell To Pay was set to miss the race had it been staged as planned on Saturday, before driving rain forced the remainder of the meeting to be moved to Friday night.\n\"You could say the stars are aligning a bit,\" Gardiner said.\n• Magic Millions day big bets: Warren galloper backed to win $100,000\n\"But at the same time we understand it means other connections have missed out with a scratching.\n\"Whatever the result on Friday night we already feel like winners and we can't wait to be trackside.\n\"It's been a dream so far so hopefully the dream can go a little bit longer.\"\nRead all news by\nAdam Dobbin View by Tags magic millions Racing racing queensland Click to Register Top Bookmakers",
