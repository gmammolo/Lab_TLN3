  "text": "SEC names Auhmad Robinson and Aleksandr Solovev as Athletes of the Week\nThe indoor track has started, and Texas A&M started on a high note with several medals at the McFerrin-12 Degree Invitational in Bryan-College Station.\nOn Tuesday, the SEC named Auhmad Robinson the Runner of the Week and Alex Solovev the Men's Freshman of the Week following the meet. The Aggies are set for a strong indoor season, and we can expect more Texas A&M weekly awards from these two.\nBelow is the excerpt from the release from the conference officials:\nTexas A&M’s Auhmad Robinson opened his indoor season with a pair of victories at the McFerrin-12 Degree Invitational. The first he broke the Texas A&M school record in the 300m with a time of 32.34, while also becoming the third-best performer in the event in NCAA history and marking the fourth-best performance in the event in collegiate history. The junior then doubled down in the 4x400m relay, as he ran the third leg in the title-winning relay which set the fastest time in the nation so far this year.\nTexas A&M’s Aleksandr Solovev opened his collegiate career with an event win in the men’s pole vault at the McFerrin-12 Degree Invitational with a clearance of 5.56m/18-2.75. The freshman jumped right to the No. 2 spot in the Texas A&M record books in the event with his clearance, while also leading the nation in the event with his clearance.\nThey will be back in action at the Corky Classic in Lubbock, Texas from January 17-18.\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on Twitter, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.
