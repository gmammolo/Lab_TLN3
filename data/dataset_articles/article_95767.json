  "text": "JCM Racing will field an all-female nitro team in 2025, featuring drivers Alexis DeJoria and Ida Zetterström. DeJoria will drive the Bandero Premium Tequila Funny Car, while Zetterström will operate the JCM Racing Top Fuel Dragster.\nThe duo will debut as teammates during National Women’s Month at the NHRA Gatornationals in Gainesville, Fla., on March 7-9. DeJoria, a 12-year Funny Car veteran, will run the full NHRA Mission Foods Drag Racing Series schedule, while Zetterström aims for a ten-race campaign to potentially expand her season.\n“This sport has a long history of powerful women who have made their mark not only on NHRA Drag Racing but the motorsports industry as a whole,” said team owner Joe Maynard. “Women have been at the forefront of the NHRA for many years, and we’re proud to be the first organization to have an all-female roster of nitro-powered drivers.”\nMaynard praised Zetterström’s potential championship success. “Her work ethic is incredible and that translates to success on the track,” he said. “As for Alexis, it’s clear that she is right there on the cusp, a champion-in-the-making.”\nMike ‘Zippy’ Neff will lead the Bandero Funny Car team, contributing his experience in tuning multiple drivers to race wins. Zetterström will continue to work with crew chief Jon Schaffer after their successful late-season debut in 2024.\n“I feel like we left a lot on the table when it comes to showing people what we’re capable of,” Zetterström said. “I hope we can put together the proper funding to race a full season, but regardless, I’ll be out at the track every race weekend.”\nBoth drivers come with impressive credentials, having spent years progressing through various levels of racing. Zetterström is a European drag racing champion, while DeJoria is a former U.S. Nationals champion and the first woman to achieve a three-second Funny Car pass.\n“Ida was a great addition to the tour last year, and I’m looking forward to having her as a teammate,” DeJoria said. “Our goal for this season is to be consistent and win races.”\nDeJoria and Zetterström will participate in a pre-season test session at Gainesville Raceway on March 4-5, ahead of the season opener.\nAs for Tony Schumacher, sources have indicated that he’s still seeking sponsorship for 2025 but, at this time, has no definite plans for the upcoming season.\nZetterström’s full schedule will be announced closer to the start of the season",
