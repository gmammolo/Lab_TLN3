  "text": "Home > Trail Running Record-destroying ultrarunner David Roche hopes to win Western States 100 \"I'm in it to win it,\" Roche says about the iconic 100-miler Photo by: Cody Bare @codybare_ Colorado’s David Roche isn’t just training for Western States 100 (WSER)—he may be redefining what’s possible. A coach, writer and ultrarunning phenom, Roche made waves when he shattered the Leadville 100 course record, a performance so dominant it was chosen as Trail Performance of the Year. Now, he’s offering a behind-the-scenes journey as he chases a bold goal: to stand on top of the podium at WSER.\n“I’m in it to win it” Roche likens his journey to WSER as more than a training plan—it’s also a science experiment with his own body as the subject. In the intro to his series, he reflected on his 18 years of endurance training, likening each day to laying a brick in a structure he couldn’t yet envision. “Now, I get 166 more opportunities to lay down bricks to the dream I never really let myself fully imagine,” he said.\nBut Roche is doing more than dreaming—he’s determined to chase that first-place finish.“I know it probably ruffles some feathers when I say that I’m in it to win it. I’m not that guy, right? Deep down, I definitely don’t think I am. Well… I was wrong both times before.”\n19-year-old Leadville 100 course record falls\nRedefining the playbook To make history, Roche knows he can’t play by the usual ultrarunning rules. His plan? Show up with “track-ready 5K fitness” to outpace even the best in the sport. He’s throwing himself into speedwork and running economy like never before, aiming to push boundaries and rewrite the expectations of a 100-mile race. “I’m going to get fast. Really fast,” he says.\nDavid Roche Javelina Jundred 2024. Photo: Cody Bare @codybare_ Why you’ll want to watch Roche is inviting the world to follow his journey in a new YouTube series, Road to Western States, with the first episode titled “Shock the World.” Roche offers a raw, unfiltered look at what it takes to chase greatness.

Maybe I’ll crash and burn,” he says. “Either way, I’ll have a story to tell.” For anyone who’s ever dreamed big or rooted for the underdog, this is the story to watch.
