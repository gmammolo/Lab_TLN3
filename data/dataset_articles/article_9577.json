  "text": "Local\nRed Cross helps families forced out of south Charlotte apartment from fire\nAmerican Red Cross volunteers were on site helping families at a south Charlotte apartment complex Thursday morning as fire investigators walked through the charred remains of units that were burned in a two-alarm fire. Five people were hospitalized.\nThe fire was reported at 5:30 a.m. and burned through the second and third floors of an apartment unit at Aurea Station Apartments, said Charlotte Fire Battalion Chief J.P. Soto.\nAt least four apartments in the 8500 block of Winter Oaks Lane were damaged, he said.\nEight or nine fire trucks responded and extinguished the fire in under 90 minutes, Soto said.\nThe cause of the fire is being investigated. Soto said investigators were also looking through the units to make sure there was nothing that could reignite the fire.\nFamilies displaced by apartment fire\nNeighbors watched as fire investigators walked through the apartments later Thursday morning. Some neighbors stood eating on top of the hood of a car, while others huddled with American Red Cross volunteers who arrived to help.\nJason Gudzunas, the executive director, said he and volunteers arrived on scene about two hours after the fire broke out.\n“We want to make sure their immediate needs are met,” Gudzunas said. “We want to make sure they’re safe and comfortable.”\nPeople impacted will receive mental health support and spiritual care, as well as referrals for long term care. He said the Red Cross was still evaluating if the families impacted would receive financial assistance or be set up in a shelter.\nThe total number of people affected wasn’t yet available.\nGudzunas’s wife, Christina, is also a Red Cross volunteer and was on site to support the families.\nOne of the first things she does when arrives to help people is give them comfort and someone they can talk to. She also finds out what they immediately need and helps them get those things, like blankets and hairbrushes.\n“All those things that they’re going to go to first thing in the morning,” she said. “They’re going to brush their teeth and not have a toothbrush. We have all that set up.”\nGudzunas said the Red Cross website has information on fire safety and training, as well as opportunities to have smoke alarms installed homes.\nThis is a developing breaking news story.
