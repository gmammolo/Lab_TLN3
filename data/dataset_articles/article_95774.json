  "text": "STEVENS POINT, Wis. — Two Wisconsin cross country coaches were recipients of the 2023-2024 National Coaches of the Year award given out by the Coaches Association of the National Federation of High School Associations (NFHS).\nKevin Hopp is the men’s co-head coach at Stevens Point Area Senior High School (SPASH). Hopp received the award for the 2023-2024 school-year after leading the Panthers to their third straight WIAA State championship alongside coach Dohn Behnke. SPASH scored a state-record 36 points at the meet.\nHopp and Benke are no strangers to success. Working together since 2003, these two coaches have built SPASH into a powerhouse program, accounting for 124 cross country invitational victories and 21 conference championships.\nThe other National Coaches of the Year award was received by girl’s co-head coach Terrence Krall for his work with the Slinger High School Owls. Krall and co-coach John Strand helped lead the girls cross country team to a 2023 state title.\nIt was Krall’s first state championship win after a lifetime coaching cross country, with 55 years of experience. He’s coached various teams at Slinger High School since 1988 and was inducted into the Slinger High School Athletic Hall of Fame in 2015.\nKrall’s National Coach of the Year award follows his 2023 Wisconsin Cross Country Coaches Association (WCCCA) Girls Cross County State Coach of the Year award.\nKrall’s accolades will be remembered as he’ll be inducted into the WCCCA’s Hall of Fame in 2025.\nCoaching awards are broken down into three categories: state, sectional and national awards by the NFHS coaches’ association advisory committee. Comprising of one chair and eight members, the committee ranks candidates according to a point system in order to award national winners.",
