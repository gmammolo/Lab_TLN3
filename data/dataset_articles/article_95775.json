  "text": "The Alexandria Trojans will take on the Neville Tigers at 5:30 p.m. on Friday. Alexandria has been getting the ball to fall more lately as they've increased their point totals each of their last three games.\nAlexandria is headed into the matchup having just posted their closest win since December 13, 2024 on Tuesday. They sure made it a nail-biter, but they managed to escape with a 66-63 victory over Northwest. Given the Trojans' advantage in MaxPreps' Louisiana basketball rankings (they are ranked 11th, while the Raiders are ranked 73rd), the result wasn't entirely unexpected.\nJordyn Johnson was his usual excellent self, going 9 for 22 en route to 24 points. That makes it three consecutive games in which he has scored at least a third of Alexandria's points. Another player making a difference was Tyshawn Duncan, who almost dropped a double-double on nine points and 11 rebounds.\nMeanwhile, it was close, but on Tuesday Neville sidestepped Northwood for a 48-46 win.\nAlexandria's victory was their tenth straight at home dating back to last season, which pushed their record up to 20-5. They've dominated over that stretch too, winning by an average of 24.9 points. As for Neville, they are on a roll lately: they've won ten of their last 13 games, which provided a nice bump to their 17-7 record this season.\nAlexandria was able to grind out a solid win over Neville in their previous meeting back in January of 2020, winning 57-46. The rematch might be a little tougher for Alexandria since the squad won't have the home-court advantage this time around. We'll see if the change in venue makes a difference.\nArticle generated by infoSentience based on data entered on MaxPreps",
