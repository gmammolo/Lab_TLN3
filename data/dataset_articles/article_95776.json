  "text": "Alexandria extended their home winning streak to ten games dating back to last season thanks to a huge performance from Jordyn Johnson. The Alexandria Trojans sure made it a nail-biter, but they managed to escape with a 66-63 win over the Northwest Raiders on Tuesday thanks in part to Johnson, who went 9 of 22 en route to 24 points. That makes it three consecutive games in which he has scored at least a third of Alexandria's points.\nAlexandria has been performing well recently as they've won five of their last six contests, which provided a nice bump to their 21-5 record this season. As for Northwest, they are on a four-game losing streak that has dropped them down to 11-9.\nBoth squads will have to hit the road in their upcoming games. Alexandria will venture away from home to face off against Neville at 5:30 p.m. on Friday. Neville knows how to get points on the board -- the team has finished with 55 points or more in their past three matches -- so hopefully Alexandria likes a good challenge. Northwest has already played their next game (against Tara), but no score has been uploaded at the time of writing.\nArticle generated by infoSentience based on data entered on MaxPreps",
