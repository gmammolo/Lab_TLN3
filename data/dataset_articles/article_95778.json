  "text": "Fortnite will surprise fans once again by bringing the legendary creature Godzilla to the game. Starting January 17, it will be possible to play as Godzilla on the Fortnite island for a limited time. But you might need a little luck to get this special experience. Here are the details…\nYou’ll be able to compete to control Godzilla in Fortnite\nAccording to Epic Games, a random portal will first appear on the map during Battle Royale matches. The first player to enter this portal will continue the game as Godzilla. Other players will fight a “boss battle” against Godzilla. Godzilla comes with three special abilities:\n- Roar to detect players in the environment,\n- Stomp to blast enemies, and\n- Heat Beam to destroy buildings.\nOther players will face Godzilla in a “boss battle” of sorts. Attacks on weak points will deal extra damage, granting collectible health shards and fast movement charges. Players will also be able to use the returning rail gun to take down Godzilla. The event will run until February 21, when Fortnite’s current season ends.\nAs usual with these events, Fortnite is also offering exclusive skins for players. Battle pass holders can unlock a reactive Godzilla skin by completing missions. This suit will glow after each kill, increasing your risk of being spotted by enemies. Kong and Mechagodzilla costume packs are also being added to the store. Mechagodzilla even has an effect that glows when enemies attack players.\nWhat do you think about this event? Let us know in the comments below.",
