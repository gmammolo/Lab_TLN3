  "text": "After losing to Longview the last time they met, Rockwall-Heath decided to demonstrate that turnabout is fair play. The Rockwall-Heath Hawks walked away with a 52-43 win over the Longview Lobos on Friday. Given the Hawks' advantage in MaxPreps' Texas basketball rankings (they are ranked 82nd, while the Lobos are ranked 373rd), the result wasn't entirely unexpected.\nKaleb Turner-Dicus was his usual excellent self, going 7 of 16 on his way to 17 points in addition to five rebounds and three steals. Another player making a difference was Jaden Jackson, who posted 11 points and five boards.\nHawks\nPrevious 2 Games\nRockwall-Heath smashed the offensive glass and finished the game with 12 offensive boards. That strong performance was nothing new for the team: they've now pulled down at least nine offensive rebounds in eight consecutive matches.\nDespite the loss, Longview still got an impressive performance from Demarion Williams, who went 6 for 11 en route to 16 points and seven rebounds. The contest was Williams' third in a row with at least ten points. The team also got some help courtesy of Jeffery Smith, who put up eight points.\nRockwall-Heath is on a roll lately: they've won nine of their last 11 games, which provided a nice bump to their 18-5 record this season. As for Longview, the loss snapped their winning streak at five games and leaves them with a 12-8 record.\nRockwall-Heath wasted no time getting back out on the court and has already played their next matchup, a 56-52 victory against Rockwall on the 7th. Longview has also already played their next contest, a 52-44 win against North Forney on the 7th.\nArticle generated by infoSentience based on data entered on MaxPreps",
