  "text": "January 16, 2025 | Posted by Jeffrey Harris Image Credit: WWE Share on twitter Share on facebook Tweet – As noted , Shotzi picked a huge win over Stephanie Vaquer last Tuesday on WWE NXT. This now earns her a shot at NXT Women’s North American Champion Fallon Henley. After the match, an emotional Shotzi discussed winning her first singles match in almost a year in a WWE digital exclusive video .\nShotzi said on her victory, “Well, first of all, that was my first singles match in almost a year. Sorry, it’s just been such a long journey to get back into the ring, and I feel like that match really set the tone for my 2025.” She continued, “I didn’t need Fallon’s help to win that match, but I think she proved how much of a chicken she really is, and I’m about to prove how ballsy Shotzi is.\nFallon Henley will defend her title against on NXT later this month at Center Stage in Atlanta, Georgia on Tuesday, January 28. The show will be broadcast live on The CW.
