  "text": "Atlanta United’s £10M bid for Newcastle star Almiron set to be accepted this week\nAtlanta United’s offer for Miguel Almiron may be enough to get a deal done this month.\nThe Mail states that the MLS club have put in a bid of £10M for the Paraguayan.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAlmiron, who is now 30, wants to return to his old club to resuscitate his career.\nHe has become a bit part player at Newcastle under boss Eddie Howe over the past 12 months.\nOnce a favorite of the manager, he is now a bench option who rarely plays in the Premier League from the start.\nNewcastle are unlikely to sign a replacement this month due to PSR concerns.",
