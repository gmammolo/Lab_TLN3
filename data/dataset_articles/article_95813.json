  "text": "The Providence College men’s hockey team has been on quite a heater, rattling off eight straight wins to improve to 15-3-2. Included in that stretch was a sweep of Colorado College, a pair of victories at Dartmouth to capture the Ledyard Classic, and last week’s 2-0 win at Brown to retain the Mayor’s Cup.\n“We’ve got a lot of belief, and they’re working hard,” said coach Nate Leaman . “You don’t get these moments without the work and preparation, and that’s why they’re being rewarded.”\nRelated : Hockey East teams dominating PairWise rankings The win over Brown capped the nonconference slate that saw the Friars go 10-1 and vaulted them to third in the PairWise, the system used to select and seed teams for the NCAA Tournament. But after Providence was idle last weekend, it dropped to fifth, which still has the team in good standing as it gets set to close out the regular season with 15 Hockey East games, the first 11 of which are against teams currently ranked in the top 13 of the PairWise.\nThat stretch starts this weekend with a home-and-home series against Boston College, which is second, beginning Friday night at Conte Forum. The 14-4-1 Eagles were the last team to defeat the Friars, a 3-2 win at Providence Nov. 19.\nAdvertisement\n“I feel good about us, but our second half is as hard as anyone’s,” said Leaman. “The most exciting thing is we’re just playing as a good group. We’re playing as a team, as a unit of five all the time. The right things are being said by the guys. Our young guys have really matured.”\nSophomore Tanner Adams leads Providence with nine goals. Logan Will , a graduate transfer from Colorado College, leads the Friars in points on seven goals and 11 assists, followed by Adams with 15 and freshman John Mustard 5-9—14. Will has an eight-game point streak (3-6—9), which is tied for the second-longest active in the NCAA ( Isaac Howard , Michigan State, nine).\nPower-play goal from Will for his seventh of the year to open the scoring!

The Eagles were minus captain Eamon Powell and Aram Minnetian , both of whom are right-shot defensemen and eat up a lot of minutes. Senior Aidan Hreschuk moved over to the right side to skate on the top pairing with Drew Fortescue as BC still managed to limit the Crimson to 21 shots.\nAdvertisement\nRegardless of whether Powell and/or Minnetian is available this weekend, the Eagles know what to expect when they face Providence.\n“They play very hard and they play their system very well,” said BC coach Greg Brown . “They don’t give free opportunities, they don’t give up free ice. You have to earn everything you get.\n“It’s not only important to manage the puck for us, but it’s going to be really important to keep doing the little things without the puck, taking their space away. It will be a very competitive weekend.”\nSilver lining Harvard coach Ted Donato was quick to point out that he is not about moral victories, but there were some positive takeaways from the loss at BC. It was a one-goal game late in the third period, until Brady Berard salted it away with an empty-netter with 1:19 remaining.\nThat performance followed up a six-point weekend in which Harvard posted 3-1 victories over Brown and Yale.\nAnother day, another robbery from Charette 🛑\n📺 https://t.co/Oh1XG9WVSi\n📊 https://t.co/kliBM3Kk14 #GoCrimson | #OneCrimson pic.twitter.com/ehD0g4EAh8\n— Harvard Men's Hockey (@HarvardMHockey) January 15, 2025 “It took us a while to come to the realization that we really need to defend at a really high level, and manage the puck better and not give up outnumbered rushes,” said Donato.\nThe Crimson will look to take that same approach this weekend when they hit the road for a pair of games at RPI and Union.\nWeekend plans The matchup between BC and Providence isn’t the only series in Hockey East involving teams inside the PairWise bubble. UConn (11th) heads to Maine (third) for a pair of games. Both teams are coming off sweeps and have won three in a row. It marks the first time the teams have met where both are ranked. Boston University (eighth) and UNH (13th) begin a home-and-home series on Friday in Durham … Northeastern travels to Vermont for two, while UMass and Merrimack play a home-and-home series beginning Friday night in North Andover … Bentley hosts Holy Cross for a pair of games, marking the Falcons’ first appearance on home ice since Nov. 23.\nAdvertisement",
