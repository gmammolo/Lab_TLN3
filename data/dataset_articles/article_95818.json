Last week, all three committed to play in the event at TPC Scottsdale, to be held Feb. 6-9.\nThomas, 31, is playing at The American Express in La Quinta, Calif., this week as he attempts to snap a winless drought that dates back to the 2022 PGA Championship.\nRecommended for you New Florida prison policy on trans health care 'like conversion therapy' The Marshall Project examines new restrictions on gender-affirming care in prisons, from confiscating undergarments to compelling trans people to cut their hair.
