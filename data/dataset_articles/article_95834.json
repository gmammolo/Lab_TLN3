  "text": "<p>Collin Sexton (Image via Getty)<br></p> Collin Sexton and Walker Kessler might make their way in to LeBron James' home. The Los Angeles Lakers , currently on a three-game losing streak, are in desperate need of a roster shake-up as they head toward the February 6 NBA trade deadline. After a strong start to the season, the Lakers find themselves slipping in the Western Conference standings, with a recent loss to the San Antonio Spurs intensifying their struggles. To get back on track, the Lakers are reportedly eyeing a trade with the Utah Jazz to address key issues at point guard and center.\nAccording to NBA Analysis Network's Aikansh Chaudhary, the Los Angeles Lakers are looking to acquire two players who could provide immediate impact: Collin Sexton and Walker Kessler. The trade proposal would send Gabe Vincent, Max Christie, Jalen Hood-Schifino, and a 2031 first-round pick to Utah Jazz in exchange for Sexton and Kessler. This potential move addresses both of the Lakers' major needs: a reliable scorer and a true center.\n\"After going on a small winning streak and climbing the ranks in the Western Conference standings, the LA Lakers once again find themselves in a slump,\" Chaudhary wrote. The Los Angeles Lakers' recent form has exposed their weaknesses, and with LeBron James subtly hinting at roster changes, the team must act quickly to improve its chances for the rest of the season.\nWalker Kessler of Utah Jazz (Image via Getty)\nCollin Sexton, currently averaging 18.2 points per game on a career-best 42.0% shooting from beyond the arc, would bring much-needed scoring depth to the Lakers. As Utah Jazz’s second-leading scorer, he has been consistent despite the team’s poor 10-29 record. \"Sexton would fit perfectly in the starting lineup, and he could be the third or fourth scoring option on the team,\" Chaudhary noted, suggesting the 24-year-old guard could complement LeBron James and Anthony Davis well.\nMeanwhile, Walker Kessler, a 7-foot rising star, offers the Los Angeles Lakers exactly what they need in a center. He’s averaging 10.8 points, 2.5 blocks, and shooting 72% from the field. \"Kessler is a traditional center, just what the Lakers need to give Anthony Davis some breathing room,\" Chaudhary explained. As a defensive force and an efficient scorer, Kessler could take some of the pressure off Davis, allowing the Lakers' star to focus on other aspects of the game.",
