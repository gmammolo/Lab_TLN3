  "text": "In what was the first top-flight meeting between the sides since January 1983, Ipswich were looking to build on their recent victory over Chelsea and draw away at Fulham against a Seagulls side who had drawn their last four PL matches.\nAnd although the visitors saw more of the ball in the first half, it was the Tractor Boys who had the better opportunities.\nWales international Nathan Broadhead was the first to test goalkeeper Mark Verbruggen with 23 minutes on the clock when his effort, which was heading for the right-hand corner, was pushed away by the Dutchman.\nKieran McKenna’s side had the full backing of the capacity crowd at Portman Road, and they visibly grew in confidence as the half wore on.\nAs they continued to threaten, Brighton had Verbruggen to thank again two minutes before the interval as he showed impressive agility to get across and push Omari Hutchinson’s goalbound effort from 25 yards away to safety.\nIt appeared that the momentum was with the home side as the second half got under way, however it was the Seagulls who went ahead with the first real opportunity a minute before the hour mark.\nHaving broken free down the right, Yasin Ayari squared to Matt O’Riley who laid it off to Kaoru Mitoma, and the Japanese international’s first-time shot beat Christian Walton following a slight deflection off Leif Davis to make it 1-0.\nIt could have been 2-0 less than 10 minutes later when Joao Pedro cushioned a ball into the area and shot on the turn, only to be denied by a fantastic reaction save from Walton.\nTo Brighton’s credit, they were far superior in the second half, and they doubled their advantage with eight minutes remaining when substitute Georginio Rutter showed great awareness to swivel and shoot a loose ball on the turn into the left corner to secure a hard-earned victory which lifts them two places to ninth.\nDespite another battling display, Ipswich tasted their 11th defeat of the season and remain in the drop zone by virtue of goals scored.\nFlashscore Man of the Match: Carlos Baleba (Brighton and Hove Albion)",
