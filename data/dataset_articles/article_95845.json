  "text": "Cubs avoid arbitration with Gold Glove acquisition\nKyle Tucker and the Chicago Cubs are off to a good start in their new relationship.\nThe Cubs acquired Tucker in a trade with the Houston Astros last month. Tucker is entering his last season under team control before he will be eligible for free agency. Tucker is eligible for arbitration, and it seemed like the two sides were headed there. Tucker had filed to earn $17.5 million for 2025, while the Cubs filed at $15 million.\nHowever, the sides were able to meet somewhere in the middle — slightly in Tucker’s favor. According to ESPN Cubs reporter Jesse Rogers, the two sides agreed on $16.5 million for Tucker’s 2025 salary.\nBreaking News: The Cubs and OF Kyle Tucker have agreed on a $16.5 mil contract for 2025, sources tell ESPN. The sides avoid an arbitration hearing and Tucker will be in Chicago for the team's fan convention this weekend.\n— Jesse Rogers (@JesseRogersESPN)\n[January 16, 2025]\nAgreeing to the deal allows the sides to avoid the abritration process, which can sometimes leave a sour taste in the mouth of a player.\nThe Cubs are excited about having an All-Star player in Kyle Tucker. For the last four seasons, he has been an above-average hitter and a Gold Glove outfielder. He has hit 30 home runs in a season twice and boasts a .274 career average. Even though injuries impacted him in 2024, he still hit .289 with 23 home runs in just 78 games with Houston.\nIn additition to making three straight All-Star teams, Tucker won a Gold Glove award in 2022 and Silver Slugger award in 2023. He is set to help replace Cody Bellinger, whom the Cubs traded to the Yankees.",
