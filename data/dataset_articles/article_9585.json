  "text": "Mountain communities have transformed their approach to disaster preparedness, shifting from reactive to proactive strategies. Many households are accustomed to keeping emergency supplies due to frequent winter weather events. However, there are still disparities between urban areas with better store access and rural areas where residents may need to travel longer distances to stock up before a storm. Temperature variations exceeding 20% cause demand fluctuations for around 14% of major consumer packaged goods. Local residents have adapted by maintaining rolling inventories of essential supplies throughout the year, rather than waiting for storm warnings to trigger panic buying. Mountain towns are revolutionizing their emergency response through citizen-led initiatives. The Town of Black Mountain launches a Community Emergency Response Team program, which will train citizens to assist local first responders in emergency and non-emergency situations. Veteran EMT and firefighter David Billstrom is working with the Black Mountain Fire Department to establish a Community Emergency Response Team, which trains and coordinates citizens to assist first responders in emergency and non-emergency situations. While more than 7,000 CERTs are active throughout the country, including approximately 84 in N.C., Black Mountain will be the first in Western N.C. These programs have proven invaluable, with Billstrom, who coordinated communication for the town’s rescue and recovery efforts, was impressed with the specialized skills of his fellow volunteers. “In many ways, they had more training and experience with disasters than the police and fire chiefs,” he said. That · could include a small snow shovel, jumper cables, a flashlight, blankets and extra clothes, chargers for cell phones, water, food, a tow rope, a spare tire and a first aid kit. Mountain residents have learned to treat their vehicles as potential emergency shelters, recognizing that If you get stranded in your car during a blizzard, put your hazard lights on. New Hampshire officials · advise putting a distress flag in your window or on your antenna and staying put unless you can see a building where you know you can take shelter. Smart strategies include keeping A bag of sand or kitty litter is also helpful because it can weigh the vehicle down, making it easier to drive in the snow. Plus, if you get stuck, you can sprinkle it on the ground to help with traction. These preparations have proven life-saving during unexpected blizzards. Mountain communities have recognized that power outages during blizzards can last for extended periods. Palange has been through her fair share of winter storms in New Hampshire and Maine. She was once stuck with no power for two weeks after an ice storm in 1998. She had heat from a wood stove, but no way to cook or shower. This experience has shaped modern preparedness strategies. Liberty Utilities is preparing for potential power disruptions, according to posts on the utility company’s social media pages. Crews are standing by to respond to outages. They advise customers to ensure their contact information is up to date, keep electronic devices charged, fuel up automobiles, keep cash on hand and prepare at least a 48-hour supply of nonperishable food and water. Mountain communities have developed sophisticated communication networks to handle blizzard conditions. Members of CERT will be issued a radio through which they can communicate with the department, and also utilized in non-emergency situations, according to Billstrom. “We looked at other CERT teams, and one lesson from the ones that have thrived through the years is that they need to be deployed often,” he said. These communication systems serve multiple purposes, ensuring that emergency response teams can coordinate effectively even when traditional communication infrastructure fails. The approach recognizes that “This isn’t just get trained and wait for the next emergency, this helping out at the parade, festivals and perhaps, a large wildland fire. We’ll be looking for opportunities to deploy them, so they can use what they learn.” · One objective is to establish a multi-use resource for local first responders. Mountain residents have mastered the art of emergency food storage, moving beyond traditional “bread and milk” approaches. But if you stock your pantry with filling shelf-stable foods, you won’t go hungry while waiting for the snow to be cleared. Here are some of the most important snowstorm essentials to purchase well in advance of an impending storm: Bottled water (at least one gallon per person per day for at least three days) Canned goods, especially cozy, warming foods like soups and stews · Snack foods like chips, crackers and cookies in sealed packages. This strategic approach recognizes that While gathering all these supplies, don’t forget to fill up your car’s gas tank. Winter storms could interrupt fuel deliveries in your area. The emphasis on shelf-stable foods ensures families can maintain nutrition even during extended power outages when refrigeration becomes unavailable. Mountain communities have learned that relying on a single heating source during blizzards can be dangerous. Before the winter season begins, make sure you can heat your home safely. Prepare your home to keep out the cold with insulation, caulking, and weather stripping. Consider using an indoor thermometer or thermostat to monitor the temperature inside. These preparations have become standard practice in alpine regions. Install and test smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors with battery back-ups. Be ready to live without power, gas, and water. Learn how to keep pipes from freezing. The focus on backup heating systems and carbon monoxide detection reflects hard-learned lessons from past winter emergencies where residents faced life-threatening situations. Recent blizzards have demonstrated the critical importance of understanding road closure patterns. The snow has closed a 70-mile stretch of Interstate 80 near the Nevada state line for more than a day after highway officials reported stranded drivers Friday night. Some areas of the Sierra saw more than 7 feet of snow in a 72-hour period, according to the National Weather Service, including Sugar Bowl, California, which received 89 inches (7.42 feet) and Donner Peak, California, which got 87 inches (7.25 feet). Mountain communities have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring road conditions and coordinating with emergency services. “At one point, emergency personnel and tow trucks had a difficult time getting to motorists due to blizzard conditions,” the agency said. Many other roadways in the area are closed due to the weather and some are being chain controlled, requiring vehicles to have chains to proceed on the roadways. Mountain ski resorts have become integral to community emergency preparedness strategies. Ski resorts were thrilled with the impending snowfall but joined officials in warning that mountain roads could be closed during the worst of the storm. Ski resorts could face partial or full closures during the peak of the blizzard on Friday and Saturday. “We do expect that Sunday will be a day of patience as we dig out,” Palisades Tahoe said on social media. These facilities provide crucial resources during emergencies, including “It’s going to DUMP,” Mammoth Mountain said on social media. “It’s looking like we have a lot of digging to look forward to the next few days.” · “During these major storms expect DEEP snow, always ski and ride with a buddy, keep your buddy in sight and avoid the base of trees. Be aware of Snow Immersion Suffocation (SIS) dangers,” Mammoth Mountain said. Mountain communities have dramatically improved their weather monitoring capabilities, recognizing that “It’ll arrive with a vengeance,” said meteorologist Amanda Young of the National Weather Service’s Reno office, which issued a rare blizzard warning for the region, which is typically issued only once a year or every other year. This level of forecasting precision allows communities to prepare more effectively. A blizzard warning through Sunday morning covers a 300-mile stretch from north of Lake Tahoe to south of Yosemite National Park. “Your safe travel window is over in the Sierra,” the National Weather Service in Reno posted Thursday morning on social media. “Best to hunker down where you are.” Communities have learned to take these warnings seriously, with Meteorologists predict as much as 10 feet of snow is possible in the mountains around Lake Tahoe by the weekend, with 3 to 6 feet in the communities on the lake’s shores.
