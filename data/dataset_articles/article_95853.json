  "text": "Outfielder Jesse Winker and the New York Mets have agreed on a one-year deal, according to multiple reports Thursday.\nWinker, 31, will return to the Mets after the club acquired him in a trade from the Washington Nationals at the deadline last summer. The deal is pending Winkler passing a physical, according to reports.\nHe signed a minor-league deal with Washington coming off an injury-plagued 2023 campaign with the Milwaukee Brewers. He thrived with the rebuilding Nationals, hitting 11 home runs with a .257/.374/.419 slash line, which made him an attractive trade candidate for contending teams seeking a left-handed bat.",
