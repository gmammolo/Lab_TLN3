  "text": "UFC Hall of Famer Michael Bisping is expecting Jamahal Hill vs. Jiří Procházka will steal the show at UFC 311.\nUFC light heavyweight contenders Jamahal Hill and Jiří Procházka may not be the headlining fight at UFC 311, but their clash is arguably just as important as a title fight. Both fighters are looking to make a strong case for another shot at UFC light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira after brutal knockout losses to the titleholder in their most recent outings.\nThere’s a lot of pressure on Hill and Procházka this weekend to make a statement to the rest of the UFC light heavyweight division. Both former titleholders have one-punch knockout power, and their fight is expected to be an intriguing matchup for as long as it lasts.\nMichael Bisping feels Hill vs. Procházka not only has the chance to earn ‘Fight of the Night’ honors but there’s a chance it’ll end destructively.\nREAD MORE: Arman Tsarukyan’s incredible ‘$100 million’ net worth leaked by MMA legend ahead of UFC 311 Photos by WWE/Getty Images, Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images Michael Bisping predicts Jamahal Hill vs. Jiří Procházka won’t go the distance During the UFC 311 preview show on TNT Sports , Bisping gave his breakdown for Hill vs. Procházka.\n“Jamahal Hill has been going after everyone online, doing a great job at turning the fanbase against him,” Bisping began on Hill vs. Procházka. “But the way I look at that is he has a chip on his shoulder…he’s annoyed, embarrassed, and mad. And those emotions could help you! He holds this dear to his heart. And on the flip side, Jiří Procházka, the samurai. We call that a joke, but he’s serious when he says he’s been out in Japan training with karate grandmasters…he’s got a wild style, crazy aggressive, unpredictable…\n“I cannot wait for this fight. This could be ‘Fight of the Night’ as long as it lasts, it’s going to be one of the most exciting fights you’re ever going to see. And somebody is going to get knocked out cold, I guarantee it!”\nHill and Procházka both demonstrate tendencies to search for finishes inside the Octagon, with both positive and negative outcomes. The two former champions earned light heavyweight gold by dismantling some of the division’s top challengers in horrific fashion.\nProcházka’s most-recent TKO/KO win came against Aleksandar Rakić at UFC 300 last April. The victory earned him a short-notice title rematch against Pereira at UFC 303, falling to the Brazilian for the second time by stoppage.\nHill, who earned the then-vacant belt by outpointing Glover Teixeira at UFC 283, earned three consecutive knockout wins before the Teixeira clash. He finished Jimmy Crute, Johnny Walker, and former title challenger Thiago Santos before getting the title shot.\nREAD MORE: ‘This is gonna be WrestleMania’… Israel Adesanya makes prediction for UFC 311 title fight Jamahal Hill vs. Jiří Procházka winner could be next for Alex Pereira Pereira, who most recently defended the belt against Khalil Rountree Jr. at UFC 307 in October, is expected to face the surging Magomed Ankalaev for his next title defense. But Hill and Procházka have the opportunity to potentially skip the line and change the UFC matchmakers’ course for the division.\nAdding to the intrigue surrounding Hill vs. Procházka, there have been some back-and-forth barbs between the two former champions in recent months. While the extent of their brewing bad blood is debatable, their pre-fight barbs could add to a likely furious-paced fight at UFC 311.\nHill and Procházka are both looking to kick off the new year with a bang, and Bisping and other analysts believe it’s almost a guarantee that their clash won’t last long.\nREAD MORE: Joe Rogan’s rib-crushing kicks leave UFC fans speechless",
