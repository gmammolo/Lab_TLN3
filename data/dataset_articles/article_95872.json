  "text": "Toughman Contest returns to Clarksburg Friday\nCLARKSBURG, W.Va (WDTV) - The 46th annual Original Toughman Contest is back in Clarksburg tomorrow at the Nathan Goff Armory. The owner of the event says the Toughman is unique.\n“For the most part, 80 to 85% probably are brand new people who have never been in this before, and I think that’s what makes it so exciting because you’re seeing different people with little or no experience,” said Jerry Thomas, owner of the Original Toughman Contest.\nFighters from all over will compete in dozens of bouts. One of those boxers who will be fighting in a pro-match is Dakota the Lone Wolf Linger from Buckhannon. He wants fans to be on the edge of their seats.\n“I’m hoping they see a lot of action like always and a knockout,” said Linger.\nThe pugilist will have a chance to win up to $25,000 in prize money. The 1993 Toughman champion calls the tournament a battle of wills.\nTickets for the Friday and Saturday events start at $25, and the fight begins at 7 p.m. sharp.\nThomas wants fans to know anything can happen at Toughman.\n“Ya never know what you’re going to see that’s the other part to this, when I think I have seen everything something new happens and I’m excited myself to see the event and see these new people get in the ring and slug it out for that title,” said Thomas.\nCopyright 2025 WDTV.
