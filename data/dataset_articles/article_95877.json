  "text": "OHSAA expands postseason tournaments for high school track and field, cross country\nHigh school runners, jumpers, throwers and vaulters can rejoice.\nThe Ohio High School Athletic Association announced Thursday that postseason tournament divisions in track and field and cross country will be expanded beginning with the 2025-26 school year. The move was unanimously approved by the OHSAA's board of directors.\nTrack and field will add two divisions, increasing from three to five. Cross country will expand from three to four divisions.\nDivision I tournaments for both sports will have the smallest amount of schools. The number of schools in the other divisions will be divided as equally as possible.\nIn the current three-division format, the number of schools in each division are divided equally.\nThe Ohio Association of Track and Cross Country Coaches have made a number of proposals for expansion in both sports. Thursday's decision follows the OHSAA's recent tournament expansion of basketball, baseball, soccer, softball and girls volleyball.\n“We have been studying expansion in track and field and cross country for quite some time, just like how we studied expanding divisions in those teams sports,” OHSAA Executive Director Doug Ute said in a statement. “Adding divisions and decreasing the size of Division I has already brought such a positive change for those team sports, and now we have worked through the process to do that in track and field and cross country. We appreciate the dialogue with the OATCCC leadership and their assistance and patience.”\nDetails and postseason format information for track and field and cross country will be announced after the OHSAA board of directors approves the tournament regulations.\nReach Mike at mike.popovich@cantonrep.com\nOn X: @mpopovichREP",
