  "text": "Miami Heat Veteran Celebrates Jimmy Butler’s Impending Return\nCount Miami Heat forward Kevin Love among those excited to see Jimmy Butler hit the court Friday night.\nLove celebrated Butler’s impending return with an Instagram post Thursday. The veteran big man shared an infamous scene from The Wolf of Wall Street where Leonardo DiCaprio’s character expresses he’s “not f----g leaving.”\n“LIVE LOOK - Jimmy after his meeting with Micky,” Love wrote, adding a #getmyjoyback caption.\n“Micky” refers to Heat owner Micky Arison, who reportedly planned to meet with Butler before Friday’s game against the Nuggets.\nThe Heat suspended Butler two weeks ago for conduct detrimental to the team; he requested a trade Jan. 2. He remained in Miami during the Heat’s West Coast road trip and worked out at team facilities.\nIt is unclear how much Butler will play Friday night. He’s played only 59 total minutes across three games since Dec. 20.\nIt’s also unclear how the Kayesa Center crowd will react to Butler’s presence. At least he knows Love still has his back.\nHEAT BRINGING BACK VICE UNIFORMS\nButler isn’t the only impending returner for the Miami Heat.\nThe Heat announced Thursday they’ll begin wearing their popular Vice uniforms again, beginning Friday night.\nThese are the Original Vice jerseys the team first wore in 2018, a year before Butler arrived via trade.\nThe white Vice uniform replaces the Heat’s traditional white Association look.\n“This ain’t a dream - we’re ready to rock the #TheOriginalVice,” the Heat’s official X (formerly Twitter) account posted.\nButler is expected to return Friday night following his seven-game suspension. The Heat featured a Vice version of Butler’s jersey on their website Thursday morning.\nREDICK OFFERS LOFTY PRAISE FOR HERRO\nLos Angeles Lakers coach JJ Redick likes what he sees from Heat point guard Tyler Herro.\nIn fact, Redick acknowledged teams need to gameplan around Herro the way they do for an NBA great.\n“You gotta treat this guy like Steph Curry,” Redick said after the Lakers’ 117-108 victory over the Heat. “That’s the way he’s playing right now.”\nComparing any player to Curry, one of the greatest sharpshooters in league history, warrants serious examination. However, Herro has certainly earned that degree of praise in his best season yet.\nHerro scored a game-high 34 points on 12 of 18 shooting Wednesday night. He added four rebounds, three assists, and a steal.\nWhen it comes to modeling Curry, Herro drilled seven of his 12 three-pointers. Only Minnesota Timberwolves superstar Anthony Edwards, who has made 167 threes this season, has more than Herro’s 156.\n“Just trying to take what the defense gives me,” Herro told reporters Wednesday. “Open shots; they overreact to different things, and I just take advantage of what they give me.”\nGood news for Redick: he won’t need to see Herro again this season unless the Lakers and Heat miraculously face off in the NBA Finals.\nMIAMI HEAT ON SI’S JIMMY BUTLER COVERAGE\nNBA Legend Rips Pat Riley for Disrespecting Jimmy Butler\nNBA Insiders Believe Miami Heat Should Have Moved Jimmy Butler Last Season\n14-Year NBA Vet Blasts Heat President Pat Riley, Supporters\nMiami Heat Fans Still Debating Jimmy Butler’s Legacy\nMORE HEAT NEWS\nNBA Insider Reveals Jimmy Butler Hasn’t Opposed Trade To Eastern Conference Title Contender\nTrade Proposal: Miami Heat Add Electrifying Scorer From Utah Jazz\nJake Elman works as a contributing writer to Miami Heat on SI.
