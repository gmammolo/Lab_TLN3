  "text": "RJ Barrett scored 22 points as the lowly Toronto Raptors turned the tables on the Boston Celtics with a dominant 110-97 victory over the reigning NBA champions.\nThe Raptors, who are languishing three places off the bottom of the Eastern Conference, grabbed only their 10th win of the season after stifling Boston's offense.\nThe win came as sweet revenge for Toronto, who had been on the receiving end of a 125-71 mauling by the Celtics in Boston on December 31.\n\"It was a tough loss for us in Boston,\" head coach Darko Rajakovic said.\n\"This group is very connected and is a very prideful group - so we really wanted to go out there and compete at the highest level. Everybody contributed tonight.\"\nBarrett also had 10 rebounds and eight assists while Scottie Barnes added 18 points and Jakob Poetl finished with 16 points and 11 rebounds.\nThe Raptors limited Boston star Jayson Tatum to 16 points from five-of-15 shooting.\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE",
