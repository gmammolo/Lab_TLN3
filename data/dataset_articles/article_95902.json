  "text": "The statue unveiling ceremony for Miami Heat legend Dwyane Wade last October was a huge moment , honoring his incredible legacy. During the event, Wade gave a powerful speech and made a bold statement: “A house divided against itself will not stand. You’re either in, or you’re out.”\nThis line caught the attention and sparked some controversy, with fans wanting more explanation as it went viral. Recently, Wade cleared up the meaning behind his words.\nDwyane Wade explained that his comment was a reflection on the Miami Heat’s unwavering commitment to their unique organizational culture, heavily influenced by team president Pat Riley.\nTo elaborate on it in a recent podcast, he said, “I wanted them to know if you don’t want to be here and the way things are working here. Then don’t be here. This is not the org for that.”\nDwyane Wade on his “your either in or out” comments on statue night\n“I wanted them to know if you don’t want to be here and the way things are working here… then don’t be here. This is not the org for that… Lebron only stayed 4 years, it wasn’t ran the way he wanted it to, it… pic.twitter.com/PipYohWDY8\n— Emo Jimmy (@HeatCulture13) January 15, 2025 Referencing Lakers legend and former Heat player LeBron James, Dwyane Wade added, “LeBron only stayed 4 years. It wasn’t run the way he wanted it to be; it wasn’t run the way Wade wanted it to be. It’s run the way Pat Riley is going to run it.”\nHis explanation makes it clear that the organization won’t change to accommodate every star who joins. If an individual is dissatisfied with the organization’s management style, they should opt-out.\nDwyane Wade exposes flaws in Barkley’s NBA ratings idea In his Apple Podcast show The Why with Dwyane Wade, Miami Heat legend Dwyane Wade shared his thoughts on Charles Barkley’s idea to fix NBA ratings . Barkley, in an interview with Dan Patrick, suggested starting the NBA season at Christmas to avoid competition with other sports like college and pro football.\nWade, however, wasn’t on board with him. The former Miami star argued, “Once again we have a thousand games, they have 18 now games that they just put we can’t compete with them… if they decide to come on Christmas, they gonna come on Christmas just all them basketball fans just make sure y’all tune in.”\nHe added, “That’s our s–t. That’s… Christmas is ours. Thanksgiving is theirs, whatever. This is about making money okay so yes the player in me say yeah get this Christmas. This all it’s about making money.”",
