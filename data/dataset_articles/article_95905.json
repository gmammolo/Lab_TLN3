  "text": "'I think we stop here': Jannik Sinner sends Open crowd into hysterics with cheeky John McEnroe sledge\nItalian superstar Jannik Sinner drew raucous laughs from the Rod Laver Arena crowd with a cheeky sledge of tennis great John McEnroe on Thursday night.\nThe world No.1 had just knocked out Aussie Tristan Schoolkate in four sets after the local hope stunned him by taking the first set.\nUnlike American upstart Danielle Collins - who sledged the crowd about how much money she makes on tour after beating Australian player Destanee Aiava - Sinner showed class in thanking the fans who packed Melbourne's iconic stadium.\nREAD MORE: Tomic games probed in match fixing investigation\nREAD MORE: Teen stuns Medvedev in five-hour epic\nREAD MORE: American veteran gets entire crowd offside with sledge\nThe 23-year-old had looked flustered early in the match when Schoolkate got on top of him with a superb serve-and-volley tactic.\nBut Sinner is typically cool as a cucumber and remained relatively calm - a fact noted by McEnroe during their on-court interview following the match.\n\"I'm pretty emotional,\" McEnroe said.\n\"Generally , when I've been in Italy, Italians express themselves. You are able to control yourself so well.\nWatch the Australian Open live & free on the 9Network & 9Now. Stan Sport is the only place to watch every match ad-free, live & on demand with centre court in 4K.\n\"I want to know how you do it.\"\nAmerican great McEnroe was famously flamboyant on the court and prone to outbursts, as many top tennis players are.\nHis question to Sinner was met with a wry smile.\n\"We can say we are a bit different, me and you,\" Sinner joked as the crowd broke into laughter.\n\"But it shows that everyone is different, everyone has their own mentality.\n\"I have mine, I have to say I'm quite happy with my one.\"\nThe crowd erupted again as McEnroe responded, \"what are you saying?\", to which a red-faced Sinner said, \"I think we stop (the interview) here\".\nSinner faces Marcos Giron in round three.",
