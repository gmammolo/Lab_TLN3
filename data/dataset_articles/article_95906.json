  "text": "Mason Mitchell is back for a part-time ARCA Menards Series schedule in 2025, this time with Venturini Motorsports, Venturini announced Jan. 16.\nMitchell will run both Kansas Speedway races and the event at Iowa Speedway.\n“I feel at home racing in the ARCA series, the success, the relationships, and time spent with the series, I enjoy it a lot,” Mitchell said in a team release. “Kansas and Iowa are my favorite places because of them being in my backyard, the success we’ve had and they always provide for great racing!\n“VMS and I have had a competitive but positive relationship over the years, our one-off race in 2015 was great and now we will have a few races to prepare to go win.”\nSee also Tristan McKee Signs Spire Driver Development Deal, Will Run ARCA Races Mitchell’s car number for his starts was not revealed.\nIn 2024, Mitchell returned to ARCA after six years away.
