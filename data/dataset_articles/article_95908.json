As my days behind the wheel of a racecar continue to wind down, the partnership with Carvana continues to celebrate my career and it’s such an honor.”\nShould he qualify for both races, his start at Charlotte Motor Speedway will mark Johnson’s 700th race.\nIn 2024, Johnson made nine starts in the No. 84, earning a best finish of 26th in the season finale at Phoenix Raceway.",
