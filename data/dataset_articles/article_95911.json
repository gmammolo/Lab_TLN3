  "text": "On the heels of its most successful regular season in franchise history, The Detroit Lions are gearing up for their first playoff game on Jan. 18, 2025, against the Washington Commanders.\nAnd when they take the field Saturday evening at Ford Field, they will have the full backing of Saints Nation.\nThe St. Clair College Centre for the Arts and the College's Main South Campus will be splashed with a Honolulu blue hue starting on Thursday, Jan. 16, as a show of support for the surging Lions as the team begins its quest for its first-ever Super Bowl title.\n\"Saints Nation stands with the Detroit Lions as they embark on what we all hope will be a deep push into the playoffs,\" said St. Clair College President, Michael Silvaggi. \"We know firsthand how much it meant to our Saints Football team when fans and the community rallied behind our eventual National Champions.\"\n\"We want the Lions to feel that same love from the Windsor-Essex community and hopefully, get the same results.\"\nCaesars Windsor, businesses throughout Windsor-Essex, and the City of Windsor are also showing their pride for 'The Pride' by casting blue light onto their respective buildings.\nStaff and students are also encouraged to get into the playoff spirit by donning their favourite Lions swag and colours to school on Friday, Jan. 17. And hopefully, that Friday tradition will continue as the Lions stalk their prey en route to the Vince Lombardi Trophy.\nGo Lions!",
