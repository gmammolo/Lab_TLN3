  "text": "Stephen Curry, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant are some of the biggest NBA stars who are getting older and close to retiring. LeBron, at 40 years old, is very close to retirement, and in maybe two or three years, Stephen Curry will retire too.\nThere is no shame in acknowledging that as they age, they can no longer perform as like as their prime. So, it looks like Curry understands their time in the NBA is coming to an end, and he doesn’t want to annoy fans or younger players.\nStephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors captain, has hinted multiple times that this might be his last year playing basketball, or maybe just one more season. He has already started thinking about his retirement, and during a special “NBA OGs Convo” on Christmas Day, Curry again mentioned that retirement is near.\n“We’re not gonna be the bitter old heads coming back hating on the younger generation, we definitely have appreciation and admiration for what they’re able to do too.”✊\n– Steph Curry on leaving the game\npic.twitter.com/j5sgSTG6JR\n— NBACentral (@TheDunkCentral) January 16, 2025 In the interview, Curry was in talks with NBA legends LeBron James and Kevin Durant about their careers and life after basketball. Curry said he doesn’t want to be a retired player who criticizes younger players.\n“We’re not gonna be the bitter old heads that are coming back hating on the younger generation but definitely appreciation and admiration for what they’re able to do too,” Curry said. Then Durant added his thoughts by talking about their shared legacy and how they’ve built something big in basketball that’s hard for anyone to break.\nStephen Curry shuts down online critics with their latest win Stephen Curry shut down his critics with an amazing performance in the Warriors’ win against the Minnesota Timberwolves . Curry scored 31 points and made 8 assists, helping his team win 116-115 on January 15.\nThis win was a big response to the critics who had been talking a lot about the Warriors’ recent struggles and possible roster changes. After the game, Curry addressed the rumors in the media about the team.\nSteph Curry on SportsCenter following the Warriors gutsy 116-115 win over the TWolves tonight:\n\"All the twitter fingers who got deals that we need to make can kind of just shut up a little bit and let us figure this thing out.\" pic.twitter.com/8ivVKSRfev\n— KNBR (@KNBR) January 16, 2025 He said, “All the Twitter fingers who got deals we need to make can kind of shut up a little bit and let us figure this thing out.” He was positive about his teammates and said that they need to keep improving to stay competitive in the West.",
