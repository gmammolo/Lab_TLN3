  "text": "French Fête\nAustin watch party cheers on San Antonio Spurs in Paris game\nThe San Antonio Spurs are taking on the Indiana Pacers on Saturday, January 25 — but the game is taking place at the Accor Arena in Paris, France. For fans who can't commit to an international plane ticket, there are two official Texas watch parties. An Austin party creates a gathering place for fans ages 21 and up, while the San Antonio party is open to all ages.\nThe Spurs are actually playing the Pacers twice at the NBA Paris Games 2025, presented by Tissot, as part of their regular seasons. The first game is Thursday, January 23, but the watch parties are specifically for the Saturday game — that's considered the Spurs' \"home\" game.\nThere's also a special NBA Paris Jam on the day between, January 24. Celebrities, influencers, and \"NBA Legends\" will compete in a unique \"interactive basketball game\" that lets fans influence how the game plays out. Anyone can tune in by making an account at france.nba.com.\nOn Saturday, Austin-area fans can gather at Armadillo Den (10106 Menchaca Rd.) to watch together with tunes by DJ DMoney and Paris-themed photo ops; the party starts at 10:30 am for a game tipoff at 11 am.\nIf fans can't go to France, they might as well bring France to them, so free coffee, macarons, French pastries, and desserts will be on hand. Fans in Spurs gear will get a free drink ticket while supplies last. The event is only open to fans 21 and up, but dogs are invited, too. Free parking will be available in the lot.\nYounger fans might want to travel to the San Antonio party at The Rock at La Cantera (1 Spurs Way), starting at 9:30 am. Unlike the Austin event, this one will have a host: TV and radio personality Zay Zay. French pastries and mimosas will be available for purchase, and the first 100 fans of drinking age in Spurs gear will get a free drink ticket.\nTo watch the game even if you're not going to make the party, tune in on KENS or via the Spurs App presented by Frost.\nAccording to a press release, \"By taking part in the Paris Games, the Spurs aim to build meaningful relationships, highlight their culture and invest in initiatives that deliver long-term benefits to the community. This effort reflects the team’s focus on fostering connections and showcasing the unifying power of sports.\"",
