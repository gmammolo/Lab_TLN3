  "text": "Rosiak: From childhood fan to colleague, how lucky I was to have gotten to know Bob Uecker\nHaving been born, raised and lived my entire life in the Milwaukee area, I fully realize how cool it is to cover the hometown Milwaukee Brewers for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\nThe 2025 season will be my 15th on the beat, but my history with the team goes back much longer, and is much deeper.\nI spent a good portion of my youth at County Stadium watching games on Brewers Pepsi Fan Club tickets and prowling out front of the ballpark asking players for autographs. I still have the baseball Marshall Edwards flipped to me in the stands in 1983. Both he and Charlie Moore signed it, and my hands shook for days after. Mimicking the batting stances of Cecil Cooper and Ben Oglivie, even though none of us kids in the subdivision hit left-handed, were musts whenever we hit the sandlots.\nI’ll never forget our teachers rolling in the big TV on the stand so we sixth-graders could watch the Brewers play for an hour in the 1982 playoffs. What a treat that was, being allowed to stay up late on a school night to watch the World Series that year, as heartbreaking as it turned out to be for a kid.\nI'm not ashamed to admit I shed some tears in the stands on Sept. 28, 2000 when we all said goodbye to County Stadium for the last time.\nThe broadcasts on 620 WTMJ were the soundtrack to my youth. I can still hear the transistor radio crackling in the garage as my father worked on his assorted projects, or tuning the dial to the game while driving to or from grandma’s house in Bay View with the family. That's how I heard the miraculous ninth-inning comeback by \"Team Streak\" on Easter Sunday, 1987.\nHeck, I used to record games on cassette tapes to listen to in the winter, whenever I began missing baseball too much (I still have those, too, by the way).\nI'm guessing many of you out there can say many of the same things.\nThe constant in so many of those memories, those moments, of course, was Bob Uecker, who died early Thursday at age 90.\nHis \"The Tonight Show\" appearances were stuff of legend, as were his Miller Lite commercials. I read \"Catcher in the Wry\" multiple times. I couldn’t wait to watch \"Mr. Belvedere\" every Friday night on Channel 12. His turn as Harry Doyle in the movie \"Major League\" was legendary (and yes, I was in the crowd for the filming of that as well).\nSo imagine my excitement when, at the age of 39, I was formally introduced to \"Mr. Baseball.\"\nIt happened on opening day in 2011, my first season on the beat, in the visiting dugout at Great American Ball Park, where the Brewers and Cincinnati Reds were getting ready to square off. My partner on the beat, the venerable Tom Haudricourt, called me over to where Uecker was standing and informed him he'd be seeing a lot more of me at the ballpark.\nUecker offered a smile, extended his hand and shook mine. I don’t remember what he said exactly, but I do know he was gracious and welcoming. And I was left awestruck, considering my newcomer status around the team.\nThe absolute coolest, most mind-blowing part? He remembered my name from that point forward. There was nothing like getting a, \"Hello, Todd!\" and a poke in the side as he walked into the clubhouse when we'd pass by each other in the pressbox. Just thinking back on those moments now makes me smile.\nUecker was, understandably, a very popular person on the road before he cut his travel schedule back and then stopped traveling at all to broadcast games. Fans in the stands clamored for him if he was in the dugout before the game, and visiting media, without fail, always tried its best to get a sound bite or two from the legend himself.\nProbably my favorite memory of Uecker away from Milwaukee was during one of the inevitable, interminable rain delays in Pittsburgh in the mid-2010s. Sitting in the print media's portion of the pressbox at PNC Park, the three members of Milwaukee's traveling party were doing their best to pass the time when Uecker emerged from the broadcast booth and sat down with us.\nBefore we knew it, 30 minutes had passed and we'd laughed like crazy, grateful for a respite from the boredom.\nAt home, it could be even better. It wasn't at all uncommon for Uecker to venture out into the dugout before batting practice had even started, greeting players, staffers and media members alike. Seeing Uecker and Carlos Gómez go in for their handshake and exclaiming \"Nice! Real nice!\" was always a hoot.\nAs the years passed and I felt more comfortable just sidling up and beginning a chat, I'd do so. And Uecker was always happy to oblige. Baseball was always an obvious topic, as was fishing. He loved talking about heading out onto Lake Michigan on his boat.\nBut to me, Uecker's best stories often involved the entertainment business.\nI'd make a point to ask a specific question about an actor he'd worked with on \"Mr. Belvedere\" or \"Major League\" and off to the races we went, hearing stories about something funny that happened during shooting on a specific day or a memory he had about a particular episode. It said something that all these years later (the final season aired in 1990) that Uecker was still in contact with all the cast members from \"Mr. Belvedere\" who were still alive.\nAnd then there were \"The Tonight Show\" stories. Simply incredible stuff, as Uecker would recall how his first appearance in 1969 came to be, and how that paved the way to over 100 more through Johnny Carson's retirement in 1992. A chat of 30 minutes or more wasn't at all uncommon.\nCarson himself, Ed McMahon, Doc Severinsen, Redd Foxx, Dabney Coleman and so many more were quite the characters, as Uecker told it.\nMore than once Uecker left me so enraptured that I skipped my usual pregame duties in order to hear more (let's hope my bosses aren't reading this; if they are, I'm sorry and I'm sure you understand). Then, when it was time to part ways, I'd walk away tingling, fully aware of how lucky I was to have had that opportunity – and that he'd thought enough of me to give me the time.\nA few times, quick-thinking colleagues snapped pictures on their cell phones while we were talking then text them to me after. How appreciative I am of their thoughtfulness now.\nSpring training was always a treat, as well.\nWhat better way to start the long slog – \"Won't this season ever end?\" Haudricourt would comically and predictably bellow after the first pitch was thrown in Cactus League play – than to look to our right and see Uecker perched in his usual spot, calling the action.\nAnd should there be a scoring decision that Uecker didn't agree with, look out! The glare over from the radio booth was something to behold (and done in jest – most of the time).\nEvery spring up until 2024, Uecker would make time to update a couple of us ink-stained wretches on how his offseason went. Some sessions were easier than others; the winter he endured heading into the 2022 season with the passing of his daughter to ALS was a brutal one, but Uecker still told the story the best he could.\nUecker had spent the better part of an hour doing that particular interview, with longtime engineer and friend Kent Sommerfeld imploring him to get ready to get on the air at the tail end. We thanked Uecker for his time and, like always, he acted like we were doing him the favor.\n\"Shoot, you guys, anytime! Happy to do it!\"\nI snapped a few pictures of Uecker as we walked out of the booth that afternoon. The best one without a doubt was him pointing at me with a big smile on his face.\nThat image will always be in my mind.\nSo too, unfortunately, will be the moments immediately following the Brewers' Game 3 loss to the New York Mets in the teams' National League wild-card series at American Family Field.\nThe brutal nature of the loss itself had emotions running high for all associated with the team anyway. But then to see Uecker in the clubhouse making the rounds, presumably saying goodbye for the final time after having just called his final inning on the radio, was heartbreaking.\nThe tears streaming down the faces of Christian Yelich and Willy Adames told the story, even though what Uecker had actually told them at the time remained unspoken. The many staff members Uecker had grown close to over the years as well. These were true friends, people who had spent countless hours with Uecker both at home and on the road, shared laughs and meals with him.\nIt can't accurately be conveyed in words.\nAfter some time, Uecker began to make his way out of the clubhouse and into the service level of the ballpark, an area bustling with activity even after the most meaningless games. Countless family members milled about, most still in shock like everybody else.\nMaybe it wasn't my place, but I followed Uecker out the double doors. I quickly made my way to him and stuck out my hand. I couldn't really think of much to say – at that moment, what is appropriate? – and told him, simply, \"Thank you, Ueck.\"\nUecker grabbed my hand, shook it firmly and grabbed my arm with his other hand, looked me in the eyes and said, \"Thank you, Todd.\"\nOne of many goodbyes for Uecker on that night, and to someone who at best was on the very periphery of his life, a random guy he'd come to know at the ballpark years ago.\nBut I'm convinced he appreciated me taking the time. Lord knows, I'm so glad I had the opportunity.\nWhy did I thank Uecker?\nFor helping make me a baseball fan. For all the memorable calls on the radio. For all the enjoyment his acting provided me. For remembering my name. For all the laughs. For the time he gave me.\nFor being Mr. Baseball. For being Brewers baseball.\nThere will never be another. And the game in Milwaukee henceforth will never quite be the same.",
