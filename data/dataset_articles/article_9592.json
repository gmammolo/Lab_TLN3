  "text": "WILCO CARES\nSupport for Victims of the July 2025 Floods\nYour donation matters....\nIn the wake of the catastrophic flash floods that tore through Williamson County on July 5th, caused by an extraordinary surge of rainfall, entire communities have been left underwater, with families displaced, homes destroyed, and the tragedy of lost lives. Liberty Hill, Leander, and Georgetown suffered the brunt of the storm in Williamson County. We’re calling on our generous community to help rebuild lives torn apart in a matter of hours. Donations received will provide direct financial assistance to those in need. Please join us in supporting Williamson County relief efforts today. Every contribution, no matter how small, offers a glimmer of hope amid this tragedy.\nTo send checks, please make them out to CTXCF or Central Texas Community Foundation with the memo: WILCO CARES.\nMailing address: 302 N. Lampasas St., Round Rock, TX 78664\nFor those affected by this tragedy, the Central Texas Community Foundation will be working with Williamson County leadership to open the application for financial support. We will post updates and provide a link to the application soon. Our thoughts and prayers are with you.",
