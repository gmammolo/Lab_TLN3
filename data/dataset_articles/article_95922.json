  "text": "A-State Football Names Agyeman Safeties Coach 1/16/2025 2:05:00 PM JONESBORO, Ark. (1/16/25) – Arkansas State head football coach Butch Jones announced Thursday that Kwame Agyeman has been named the Red Wolves' safeties coach. \"Kwame Agyeman is an individual who has valuable experience coaching not only safeties, but every position in the secondary and as a co-defensive coordinator at the FBS level,\" said Jones. \"He also has history with our new defensive coordinator, Nate Dreiling, and was part of multiple bowl games and Pac-12 championships at Oregon. Coaching numerous NFL Draft selections and all-conference players, he has a strong knowledge of the game and will be a great asset to our players and coaching staff. We are excited to welcome Kwame and his wife, Lisa, to our Red Wolves football family.\" Agyeman (Ah-jih-man) comes to Jonesboro after serving in the same role last season at Utah State and brings 10 years of collegiate experience to the sidelines for A-State. He helped the Utah State defense rank 36th nationally with 13 total interceptions in 2024. \"I'm fired up to be joining Coach Jones' staff at Arkansas State,\" said Agyeman. \"It's a fantastic opportunity to work with a great staff and at a program with plenty of tradition. I'm eager to contribute to this program and the culture that Coach Jones has built.\" Agyeman arrived at Utah State after spending the 2022 and 2023 seasons as the co-defensive coordinator and safeties coach at Nevada. In 2023, the Wolf Pack ranked 15th nationally with three defensive touchdowns and their top two tacklers were safeties who earned all-Mountain West honors. During the 2022 season, Agyeman helped the Nevada safeties account for six interceptions, five by midseason All-America choice Bentlee Sanders. Four members of Agyeman's defense earned all-Mountain West honors following the 2022 season. Prior to joining the Wolf Pack, Agyeman spent seven seasons (2015-21) at Oregon. He was a graduate assistant working with defensive backs from 2015-17 before shifting to an analyst role working with inside linebackers (2018), safeties (2019) and cornerbacks (2020-21). During his time on staff, Oregon advanced to six bowl games culminating in back-to-back Pac-12 Conference titles in 2019 and 2020 and appearances in the 2020 Rose Bowl and 2021 Fiesta Bowl. In seven seasons at Oregon, Agyeman helped coach seven players who earned Pac-12 honors, six who were selected in the NFL Draft and another who played professionally after signing a free-agent deal. Agyeman began his collegiate coaching career at Northwestern. In 2013, he worked in the recruiting office before moving to the role of quality control for special teams in 2014. He started his coaching career in the high school ranks, working in both Oregon and Illinois. Agyeman lettered at Oregon from 2004-07 and was a two-year starter at linebacker. He then played in the Arena Football League for three seasons before coaching as a volunteer assistant at Springfield's (Ore.) Thurston High School. An Illinois native, he returned home to teach and coach at his alma mater, Lake Park High School from 2010-13. Agyeman and his wife, Lisa, were married in 2018.
