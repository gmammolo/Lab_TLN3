  "text": "By Dillon Williams ,\n4 hours ago No surprises here.\nOn Thursday afternoon, senior Penn State wrestler Greg Kerkvilet was named Big Ten Co-Wrestler of the Week alongside Maryland’s Jaxon Smith.\nKerkvilet got the ball rolling for Penn State in its 55-0 shutout victory over Michigan State in the Nittany Lions’ conference opener. Kerkvilet recorded a fall in 56 seconds as he took down Michigan State’s Max Vanadia.\nAfter last week’s victory, Kerkvilet improved to 10-0 on the year with five pins and five technical falls. Penn State travels to Nebraska for a duel against the Cornhuskers at 9 p.m. on Friday, January 17.\n1",
