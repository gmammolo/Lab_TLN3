  "text": "The WPL 2025, the premier women’s T20 cricket tournament in the world, promises a thrilling season of cricket.\nThe opening match will feature the defending champion Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) against Gujarat Giants (GG) on February 14. The opener will be at the newly constructed BCA Stadium in Vadodara, and promises to be an exciting season opener for women’s cricket.\nVenue Distribution for WPL 2025 Matches For the first time in WPL history, the tournament will be played across four venues: Vadodara, Bengaluru, Lucknow, and Mumbai. This marks a major expansion from previous editions. On January 16, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) unveiled the highly anticipated schedule, which includes a total of 22 matches in this third edition.\nWPL 2025 will feature four iconic venues that will host the tournament across a vibrant schedule. The modern Kotambi Stadium in Vadodara will play host to the first six matches, starting with the opener between Gujarat Giants and Royal Challengers Bengaluru on February 14. Next, it is the historic M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, which will host eight games, the most of any venue.\nThe tournament will also include four key games to be played on the premises of the Lucknow Stadium, marking its first stint with the WPL, thus giving top-of-the-line women’s cricket action in the city. Last but not the least, the last three matches and final game of the league stage and subsequent knockouts will take place at the home turf of Mumbai. The city will host two league-stage games and both knockout matches at the prestigious Cricket Club of India (CCI).\nThe playoff format will be the same as the previous season. The team at the top of the league will directly qualify for the final. The second and third-placed teams will play an Eliminator on March 13, and the winner will go into the grand finale on March 15. In this format, every match has importance, making the league stage very competitive.\nFollowing the success of single-header format, all 22 matches in WPL 2025 will be stand-alone events, focusing attention solely on each game and thereby enhancing viewership and excitement at stadiums as well as on broadcast platforms.\nAlso Read: SA20 2025: Match 11, DSG vs SEC – Where To Watch Live Streaming, Predicted Playing XI, Date And Time\nSchedule For WPL 2025 Group Stage Matches\nMatch No. Date Time Home Team Away Team Venue 1 Friday, 14-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Gujarat Giants Royal Challengers Bengaluru Vadodara 2 Saturday, 15-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Mumbai Indians Delhi Capitals Vadodara 3 Sunday, 16-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Gujarat Giants UP Warriorz Vadodara 4 Monday, 17-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Delhi Capitals Royal Challengers Bengaluru Vadodara 5 Tuesday, 18-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Gujarat Giants Mumbai Indians Vadodara 6 Wednesday, 19-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST UP Warriorz Delhi Capitals Vadodara 7 Friday, 21-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Royal Challengers Bengaluru Mumbai Indians Bengaluru 8 Saturday, 22-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Delhi Capitals UP Warriorz Bengaluru 9 Monday, 24-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Royal Challengers Bengaluru UP Warriorz Bengaluru 10 Tuesday, 25-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Delhi Capitals Gujarat Giants Bengaluru 11 Thursday, 26-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Mumbai Indians UP Warriorz Bengaluru 12 Friday, 27-Feb-2025 7:30 PM IST Royal Challengers Bengaluru Gujarat Giants Bengaluru 13 Sunday, 1-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST Royal Challengers Bengaluru Delhi Capitals Lucknow 14 Monday, 3-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST UP Warriorz Gujarat Giants Lucknow 15 Wednesday, 6-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST UP Warriorz Mumbai Indians Lucknow 16 Friday, 7-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST Gujarat Giants Delhi Capitals Lucknow 17 Saturday, 8-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST UP Warriorz Royal Challengers Bengaluru Lucknow 18 Monday, 10-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST Mumbai Indians Gujarat Giants Lucknow 19 Monday, 10-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST Mumbai Indians Royal Challengers Bengaluru Lucknow\nSchedule For WPL 2025 Knockout Matches\nMatch No. Date Time Teams Venue Eliminator Friday, 14-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST TBD TBD Final Saturday, 15-Mar-2025 7:30 PM IST TBD TBD Also Read: Ranji Trophy 2024-25: 2011 World Cup Hero Urges Rohit Sharma And Virat Kohli To Play Domestic Cricket",
