  "text": "Virginia Athletics Director Carla Williams Signs Five-Year Contract Extension\nUniversity of Virginia athletics director Carla Williams has reportedly signed a five-year contract extension, as reported by David Teel at the Virginian-Pilot on Thursday afternoon (January 16). Williams' current contract was set to expire in June of 2025, at the end of this academic year, but now she'll be under contract at UVA through 2030. According to Teel's report, the contract extension will also include a 29% increase in guaranteed compensation, which will put her on par with her counterpart ADs in the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nThis is an important event for the immediate future of the UVA athletics department, as uncertainty and speculation regarding Williams' future at the University could have negatively impacted the school's ability to hire a new men's basketball coach, a move which will likely happen at the end of the 2024-2025 season. With the program's all-time winningest head coach Tony Bennett retiring just before the start of the season and his hand-picked successor Ron Sanchez struggling with an 8-9 record and 1-5 mark in ACC play so far in his interim season serving as head coach, it's almost a guarantee that the Cavaliers will be expanding their search nationally to find a new head coach at the end of the season.\nTrying to find that next head coach for the Virginia men's basketball program would have been complicated, to say the least, if the athletics director who has the most responsibility in that process was operating in the final months of her contract, essentially making her a lame duck. Instead, Carla Williams appears to be here to stay for the next five years. That means Williams will be responsible for finding the full-time head coaching replacement for the greatest coach in the history of UVA men's basketball and possibly, finding a replacement for Tony Elliott should the 2025 Virginia football season not go according to plan.\nCarla Williams' seven-year tenure as Virginia's athletics director has so far been met with a range of mixed opinions throughout the UVA fanbase. Since Williams was hired as the athletics director at UVA in 2017, Virginia has won nine NCAA team national championships, but each of those titles were won by coaches who were hired by Williams' predecessor Craig Littlepage, including two head coaches - Andres Pedroso for men's tennis and Todd DeSorbo of swimming & diving - who were hired mere months before Williams replaced Littlepage.\nAs for the revenue-generating sports, the UVA football and men's basketball programs declined following the respective departures of Bronco Mendenhall and Tony Bennett, but the blame for those outcomes cannot reasonably be placed entirely on the shoulders of Williams, since both coaches stepped down without provocation. While it remains to be seen if Williams' two most high-profile hires at Virginia, football coach Tony Elliott and women's basketball coach Amaka Agugua-Hamilton, will ultimately pan out, there have been other tangible improvements, such as the funding and construction of the 90,000-square foot Hardie Football Operations Center, which opened in June of 2024 and the Harrison Family Olympic Sports Complex, which is scheduled to open in the fall of 2025, as well as the notable strides made to level the playing field in terms of NIL and talent acquisition for Virginia football, which received multiple sizable anonymous donations in 2024. Williams also negotiated contract extensions for many of those championship-winning coaches, ensuring that highly-successful leaders are remaining at UVA.\nThis contract extension brings some much-needed stability to the UVA athletics department, but it still seems as though Williams' upcoming performance in selecting and hiring the next UVA men's basketball head coach and whether Tony Elliott can usher Virginia football back into an era of winning in the next couple of years will ultimately define the long-term future job security and the legacy of Carla Williams at Virginia.",
