Stroud and the Houston Texans at Arrowhead Stadium.\nThe Chiefs are no strangers to playoff football under Reid and Patrick Mahomes. The franchise has gone to at least the AFC Championship game every season Patrick has been the starter; there is just something special about this time of the year.\nBut what makes it so great?\nReid offered up his opinion on that 1 special thing.\n\"You're one of the few standing first of all,\" Reid said. \"The preparation, you got to really take care of business there, the error margin there is tiny. Got to make sure that you play well, coach well, the whole works, which is great, we're in this to challenge ourselves. No better time than now.\"\nWith the Chiefs chasing a historic three-peat and aiming to become the first-ever team to achieve three straight Super Bowls, there is ample pressure on Kansas City to keep winning.\nRelated: Chiefs Mahomes Announces Playoff Prediction for Kelce\nA 15-2 regular season record, the No. 1 seed, and a first-round bye gave Reid's team its best shot at making a deep playoff run. But the Texans and Stroud will be no pushovers, and the Chiefs, it's worth remembering, having played a meaningful game in over three weeks, so rust could be a factor.\nIs that the edge the Texans have? Possibly, but let's not forget, the Chiefs have been here before several times, so they know how to navigate it.\nAnd as Reid said, there's no better time to challenge yourself than now.\nRelated: Chiefs Vets Helping Xavier Worthy Prepare For Playoff Debut\nCopyright 2025 The Arena Group, Inc.
