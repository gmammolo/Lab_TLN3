  "text": "Utah spoiled TCU men’s basketball perfect home record with a 73-65 victory Wednesday night at Schollmaier Arena.\nThe loss marked TCU’s first home defeat of the season after starting 9-0 under head coach Jamie Dixon, who remains three wins shy of 500 career victories. Utah’s defense proved too much for the Horned Frogs, who struggled offensively throughout the night, shooting just 38% from the field and 35% from beyond the arc.\nGuard Vasean Allette , who led all scorers with 19 points, said he felt like Utah had played harder than TCU and they wanted it more.\nNoah Reynolds , TCU’s leading scorer this season, tied with senior guard Brendan Wenzel at 12 points.\n“[The Utah Utes] are really good positional defenders,” Reynolds said. “They did a really good job squeezing the lane with their length. It was difficult to get to the rim on them.”\nlet VA cook 🧑‍🍳 | @PottingerVasean pic.twitter.com/dzsnsQPRkx\n— TCU Men’s Basketball (@TCUBasketball) January 16, 2025\nDespite forcing 13 Utah turnovers while committing only eight, TCU couldn’t capitalize on the advantage, scoring just seven points off those takeaways. The Horned Frogs did show effort on the offensive glass, pulling down 15 offensive rebounds to Utah’s nine.\nThe Utes demonstrated their passing prowess with 18 assists on 24 made field goals. They built their largest lead of 14 points midway through the second half at 45-31 before TCU mounted a late comeback attempt that ultimately fell short. The Utes maintained their advantage thanks to efficient shooting, finishing at 49% from the field.\nLooking ahead, the Horned Frogs travel to Waco, Texas and face No. 25 Baylor on Sunday. Reynolds sees the road matchup as an opportunity for redemption.\n“Anytime that you get the opportunity to play against a top 25 opponent in this league, it is huge,” Reynolds said. “Especially on the road, it’s definitely a great opportunity for us. If you can’t get up for that game, you shouldn’t be here.”\nTipoff is set for 4 p.m. on Sunday at Foster Pavilion. The game broadcasts on ESPN.",
