  "text": "Ravens RB Derrick Henry is embracing his new nickname Lightening McQueen from 'Cars'\nDerrick Henry is the king of rushing in the NFL, but Lamar Jackson blessed his teammate with a new name following the wild-card win over the Steelers.\nJackson indeed compared the speed of his backfield mate to an animated automobile.\n\"It looks like a movie clip,\" Lamar Jackson responded when asked what it feels like to be on the field with Henry.\n\"The movie 'Cars' … you know when Lightning McQueen is just flying and flashing past, and it's like [whooshing sound]. That's how Derrick looks when he was running past all those guys. … I'd rather be watching it than be on the other side of the ball, I know that.\"\nMcQueen, the protagonist of Disney/Pixar's Cars, is an anthropomorphic red stock car with yellow and orange lightning bolts painted on his body, and Derrick Henry embraces the name.\nHenry had 186 yards rushing on 26 carries last night (7.2 yards per carry average) and two touchdowns.",
