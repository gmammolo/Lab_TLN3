  "text": "Sports\nTexas Receives Good News on Star Pass Rusher on Thursday\nTexas received great news on Thursday.\nAccording to ESPN's Pete Thamel, Trey Moore has decided to return to Texas for the 2025 college football season rather than declare for the NFL Draft. Moore was the last key player from the 2024 roster that seemed to be teetering between another year in college or moving on to the professional level.\nHaving Moore return to Austin is a massive win for Steve Sarkisian's staff as he recorded 10 tackles for loss, 5.5 sacks and three forced fumbles this season. He is now expected to be one of the top pass rushers in the nation for the 2025 season.\nAlthough Texas is losing nearly two dozen players to the NFL Draft this offseason, the core of the Longhorns defense looks strong for 2025 with Colin Simmons, Anthony Hill, Trey Moore and Michael Taaffe returning to lead the unit.\nTexas will kick off the 2025 season in Columbus against Ohio State on Aug. 30.\nRelated: Tracker: Texas Players That Have Declared for NFL Draft After College Football Playoff Loss\nCopyright 2025 Athlon Sports.
