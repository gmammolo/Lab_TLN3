  "text": "Aidan O'Hara\nAidan O’Hara’s performances saw him finish the 2023/24 season at the top of the Irish darts rankings.\nThis earned him the captaincy of the Republic of Ireland team that went on to win the World Darts Federation European Boys Youths Gold medal in the team cup, and gold in the overall points table.\nThe Republic of Ireland finished the tournament undefeated. They topped the group stages which included Sweden, Slovenia and Lithuania. Aidan was undefeated in all of his matches.\nThe Irish team then went on to beat Northern Ireland, Turkey and Wales to earn a place in the final against favourites, The Netherlands.\nIreland triumphed 9-7 in a tense final, with Aidan playing a real captain's part by winning four of his five matches.\nDomestically, Aidan added the Irish Matchplay title to the All-Ireland doubles title that he won with Irish teammate Sean McKeon.\nThe 17-year-old also won nine Irish ADC tour titles and once again finished top of the rankings, which saw him qualify for the Ireland A team for the World Cup in Gibraltar.\nHis achievements earned him an Annerville sports award, sponsored by Bulmers. He and the other award winners will be honoured by the Tipperary United Sports Panel at the panel's annual function at the Talbot Hotel Clonmel on Saturday night, January 25.\nSome tickets for the event are available from Sports Panel member Ken Conway, email conwayken@eircom.net\nREAD ALSO: World handball champions among those honoured with sports awards\nSubscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie\nBuy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.\nKeep up with the latest news from Donegal with our daily newsletter featuring the most important stories of the day delivered to your inbox every evening at 5pm.",
