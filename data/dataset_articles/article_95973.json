The German tactician made the comments in his first public appearance as Red Bull's Head of Global Soccer.\nIn 2023, the Premier League accused Manchester City of breaching 115 financial regulations between 2009 and 2018. The English side have denied all charges, but a verdict on the same is expected sometime this year.\nSince 2009, the Sky Blues have won eight Premier League titles, including four consecutive ones between 2021 and 2024.\nIn the 2018-19 and 2021-22 seasons, Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool missed out on the Premier League title to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City by one point. In a press conference for Red Bull, the former Reds boss was asked about Liverpool potentially being crowned champions if City are stripped of their league titles.\nTrending Klopp said (via Liverpool.com):\n\"We're getting closer [to a decision]. Should [we be handed the titles]? I don't say anything. Would [we be handed the titles]? We had this discussion when we left, if it would happen I told all the people who want it, just book the flight and I buy the beer.\" \"Whatever we have to celebrate, good weather, we would have our own parade in my garden. God what a headline. We will see. I didn't follow it all. I'm surprised you're telling me it [a verdict] is two months away. Let's see.\" Expand Tweet Despite City's dominance in the league during his tenure at Anfield, Jurgen Klopp led Liverpool to the 2019-20 Premier League and the 2018-19 UEFA Champions League titles. He left the club at the end of the 2023-24 season.",
