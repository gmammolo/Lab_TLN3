  "text": "By Steve DelVecchio ,\n4 hours ago Dec 3, 2023; New Orleans, Louisiana, USA; Detailed view of the Detroit Lions helmet during warmups before the game against the New Orleans Saints at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Detroit Lions are officially getting one of their best players back for their Divisional Round playoff game.\nDavid Montgomery has been removed from the injury report ahead of Saturday night’s game against the Washington Commanders. The star running back missed the final three games of the regular season, but he is in line to return for the biggest matchup of the year.\nThe Lions did not have to play in the Wild Card round, as they defeated the Minnesota Vikings in Week 18 to capture the NFC North title and No. 1 seed in the NFC. That extra time off was likely key in Montgomery’s recovery from a knee injury.\nMontgomery was initially reported to have torn his MCL in the Lions’ Dec. 15 loss to the Buffalo Bills. The injury was expected to end his season , but he sought multiple opinions and was able to avoid surgery.\nMontgomery finished the regular season with 775 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns. The Lions rely heavily on him and backfield mate Jahmyr Gibbs, which is why the tandem has an awesome nickname .\nWith Montgomery now back in the mix, Detroit will likely lean on their two-headed monster on Saturday. The Commanders allowed 137.5 rushing yards per game during the regular season, which was the third-worst mark in the NFL.\nThe post Lions getting star player back for playoff game against Commanders appeared first on Larry Brown Sports .",
