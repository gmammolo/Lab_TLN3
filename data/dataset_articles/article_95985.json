  "text": "ORLANDO - Following an impressive introductory season into the Big 12, UCF women’s tennis is looking to expand on its prior success during the 2025 spring season. The Knights are set to appear in 22 regular season matches before heading to the Hurd Tennis Center in Waco, Texas for the Big 12 Championship from April 16-20.\nThe team features several key returning players, as well as an abundance of newcomers. The Knights 2024 recruiting class was ranked second according to the Tennis Recruiting Network, provoking a lot of promise for the Knights. In the Big 12 preseason poll, the Knights were projected to be ranked third within the conference.\nReturning for the Knights is senior Sophia Biolay, who previously earned a spot on the All-Big 12 first team for singles. Biolay reached a career-high singles ranking of No. 57 during the 2023-2024 season.",
