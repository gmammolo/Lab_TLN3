  "text": "Mikel Arteta warned Liverpool that \"sensational\" Arsenal are back in the English Premier League title race after beating Tottenham 2-1 in the north London derby.\nDesperately needing a win, Arteta's side staged a stirring fightback after Son Heung Min's early opener for the visitors.\nDominic Solanke's own goal hauled the Gunners level before Leandro Trossard's strike put them ahead late in the first half.\nSecond-placed Arsenal's first win in four games moved them within four points of Liverpool.\nAlthough Arne Slot's team have a game in hand, Arteta is convinced Arsenal have what it takes to track down the Anfield club.\nAsked if Arsenal are title contenders, Arteta said: \"Yeah we are. There is so much to play for.\"\nIt was a cathartic victory for Arsenal, who had been knocked out of the FA Cup third round by 10-man Manchester United on penalties on Sunday, just days after losing 2-0 at home to Newcastle in the League Cup semi-final first leg.\nBut Arteta, whose side face another test against Aston Villa tomorrow, was relieved to see his players show the hunger.\n\"We were sensational. It was a big test after two games and not getting rewarded,\" he said.\n\"We were incredibly good in the last game against United and we ended up losing somehow.\n\"It's how you respond to a situation... they want to go on the pitch.\n\"It was a test of attitude, what we are made of, the courage we have. From minute one, we fully deserved to win.\"\nAnge Postecoglou slammed his Tottenham flops as \"nowhere near good enough\" after the defeat in which Spurs \"were too passive.\"\n\"Too many losses this year. Too many games getting away from us. It needs to stop,\" the Tottenham manager said.\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE",
