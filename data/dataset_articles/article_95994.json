  "text": "Mizzou’s staff is reportedly whole again. Missouri football is expected to hire Miami’s Derek Nicholson as its next linebackers coach, per a report Thursday morning from ESPN’s Pete Thamel. Nicholson had been the linebackers coach for the Hurricanes since 2023 and added the title of co-defensive coordinator in 2024.Nicholson will fill the open position vacated by D.J. Smith, who took the defensive coordinator position with Appalachian State on Dec. 30. Smith was with Mizzou for five seasons and is the only assistant coach who has been hired away from the program so far this offseason.That means, with Nicholson coming on board, Mizzou will again have filled its assistant coaching staff.Nicholson, a Winston Salem, North Carolina native, was hired by Miami in 2023. He is a Florida State alum, playing for the Seminoles from 2006-09 before being signed as an undrafted free agent by the Atlanta Falcons.\nHis stay in the league was short because of a career-ending knee injury, and he got into coaching at Oak Ridge Military Academy in his home state of North Carolina. Since then, Nicholson has spent one season as the linebackers coach at Akron, one season as the defensive line coach at Alcorn State, four seasons at Southern Mississippi, two as the defensive line coach and two as the linebackers coach and co-defensive coordinator, and three seasons at Louisville on Scott Satterfield’s staff as the inside linebackers coach.Miami recently hired a new defensive coordinator in Minnesota’s Corey Hetherman, who also coached linebackers while with the Golden Gophers.\nMizzou will have some significant turnover at the linebacker position in 2025, with at least two of the Tigers ’ core four-player rotation moving on due to eligibility after last season.\nChuck Hicks and Corey Flagg Jr. both graduated from the program, and Missouri is still waiting on a decision to return from Triston Newson, who previously was expected to run out of eligibility but can now play another year due to a recent waiver from the NCAA for former junior college players, which Newson once was.\nKhalil Jacobs is eligible to return after sustaining a season-ending injury midway through the 2024 season, as are freshmen Nicholas Rodriguez, Jeremiah Beasley and Brian Huff.Mizzou has signed two linebackers out of the transfer portal, with West Virginia’s Josiah Trotter and Nebraska’s Mikai Gbayor signed to join the roster. Missouri added two linebackers in it Class of 2025, four-star Dante McClellan and three-star Jason King. Both players are expected to enroll early and be on campus in the spring.",
