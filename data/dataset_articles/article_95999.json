  "text": "Iga Swiatek romped into the third round of the Australian Open to set up a high-profile clash with former US Open champion Emma Raducanu.\nWhile Poland's Swiatek was racing past world No 49 Rebecca Sramkova 6-0, 6-2 on Rod Laver Arena, Britain's Raducanu endured a topsy-turvy match at the nearby Kia Arena to beat her good friend Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-5.\n\"For sure it's going to be a tough one,\" world No 2 Swiatek said of facing Raducanu.\n\"Emma can play great tennis. We all know that.\"\nRaducanu, seeking to climb up the rankings after an injury-hit 2024, said she was looking forward to the challenge of playing against the five-time Grand Slam champion.\n\"It will be a very good match for me. It's an opportunity to test my game, see where I'm at,\" the British star said.\nRaducanu had reached the second round in Melbourne on three previous occasions but never advanced further.\nRaducanu, now ranked 61, missed a large part of the 2023 season following wrist and ankle surgery, and was then sidelined for two months by a foot injury.\nShe pulled out of her Australian Open warm-up event in Auckland with a back niggle and needed an injury time-out for a tight leg muscle when 3-0 down in the second set against Anisimova.\n\"Every match I can play against these top opponents, I'm loving it,\" Raducanu said.\n\"I have nothing to lose, I'm just going to swing and give it my best.\"\nSwiatek, who lost her top ranking to defending champion Aryna Sabalenka last season after a one-month doping ban, has a poor record in Melbourne by her lofty standards. She has only once progressed beyond the fourth round, in 2022, when she lost in the semi-finals.\nSwiatek now has Naomi Osaka's former coach Wim Fissette in her corner after hooking up with the Belgian towards the end of last year. He has installed a hitting partner for Swiatek as she aims to improve her record in Australia, and she said the partnership was working well.\n\"He's been great,\" said Swiatek. \"I feel he's really supportive. And you know being on the women's tour, I think it's not easy especially when most of the coaches are men. They also need to understand what we go through sometimes.\n\"I feel like Wim is doing that very well.\"\nIn men's singles, top-ranked defending champion Jannik Sinner advanced to the third round, along with American Taylor Fritz, but exciting 18-year-old Joao Fonseca was edged out in a five-set thriller.\nSinner, 23, dropped a set for the first time in 14 matches but fought back to defeat Australian wildcard Tristan Schoolkat 4-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-3. It was the Italian's 16th consecutive victory in an ominous sign for next opponent Marcos Giron.\nFritz swept through to a third-round clash against Frenchman Gael Monfils with a brutal display of power hitting in a 6-2, 6-1, 6-0 win over Chilean qualifier Cristian Garin.\nFonseca could not follow up his first-round upset of Russian ninth seed Andrey Rublev, the teenager going down to Italian Lorenzo Sonego 6-7 (6/8), 6-3, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 to the disappointment of the vocal Brazilian fans.\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE",
