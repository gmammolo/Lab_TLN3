  "text": "During a recent appearance on “The Wrestle Spot” podcast, Jeff Hardy expressed his desire to reintroduce his Willow character to TNA Wrestling.\nHardy stated last year that Willow would “definitely” return after last appearing in 2016.\nHe said, “I’ve been talking about that a lot, man. In Hillsboro, North Carolina, there’s a new Willow mask. Me and my oldest daughter designed a new face plate, and he got it, and he made the mask. I just haven’t picked it up yet. But once I get there and try it on, if it feels good, I can’t wait to bust out a Willow promo on social media or something. [I’m] super excited about that, bringing Willow back to TNA. It’ll be so much better than it was before. I think in this current evolution of what we’re doing right now, I think we wanted to go through and win the titles as kind of the OG Hardy Boys, and then after we did that and we kind of claimed the prize that we really wanted, and that was [to] have another strong tag team title reign, I think even maybe starting as early as Genesis, you’re going to start seeing a little bit of an evolution of Matt and Jeff Hardy, where they’re going to transcend being pro wrestling superstars or whatever else. We have some ideas, we have some things on the table that we’re looking to implement, and I think it will have some things that remind people of the broken universe and those characters, characters that are a little larger than life, and we think it’s time to evolve and repackage ourselves. So we look forward to doing that in 2025.”\nDuring a recent interview with Tokyo Sports, Kazuchika Okada revealed why he missed NJPW x AEW Wrestle Dynasty 2025 at the Tokyo Dome.\nYou can check out some highlights from the podcast below:\nOn how he’s adjusted to being in AEW: “I wanted to put in the effort. That’s something I can’t do in Japan. Here, I have to do completely different things, like speak English, so that’s fun. The number of matches has decreased a lot, but the number of things that aren’t matches has increased a lot, so I feel it’s rewarding.”\nOn a possible rematch with Kenny Omega: “I don’t know what the situation will be like, and it’s not impossible that he’ll be in a bad shape after returning. He’s just recovered from an illness, so I think it would be good if he could take his time and get himself in shape.”\nOn what he wants people to notice about him now: “I’d like people to watch AEW, not Kazuchika Okada. There are a lot of good wrestlers, and they’re all cool. There’s a great atmosphere, so I hope people will realize how fun AEW is.”\nOn not appearing at Wrestle Dynasty: “I can’t really say anything about it (laughs bitterly). Whether I get an offer or not is another matter, but I don’t think it’s the right time yet. I quit with the feeling that I would never compete again (in Japanese matches). If I were to go back while I was feeling like I wanted to fight well in the US, then something might have changed in my feelings. I don’t have any intention of competing in a single match, so that’s the feeling I had when I went to the US.”",
