  "text": "Kylee Owens is making a name for herself on the volleyball court. She has earned a spot on the 2024 American Volleyball Coaches Association Division I All-Americans Honorable Mention Team. This prestigious recognition highlights her exceptional contributions to Prairie View A&M University’s Lady Panthers volleyball team during an outstanding season.\nOwens has had a record-breaking year as an outside hitter, amassing 355 kills, 47 aces, and 318 digs throughout the season. Notably, she also surpassed the milestone of 1,000 career kills.\nCourtesy of Prairie View A&M University Athletics Owens’ performance this season has garnered her national attention and secured her the title of Southwestern Athletic Conference Volleyball Player of the Year, alongside a place on the All-SWAC First Team. “This is another huge accolade for Kylee, and I am so excited for her,” said Lady Panthers Head Coach Cheri Lindsay. “She definitely deserves all of these accolades that she has worked hard to get her here.”\nKylee is keeping her family’s athletic legacy going. The daughter of NFL Hall of Famer Terrell Owens, she follows in the footsteps of her father, who is celebrated as one of the greatest wide receivers in NFL history. Terrell Owens was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018. He holds multiple records, including three seasons leading the league in touchdown receptions.\nHer brother, Terique Owens, also contributes to the Owen’s legacy. After playing college football at Missouri State University, he signed with the San Francisco 49ers as an undrafted free agent.\nKylee’s achievements reflect the bright future of women’s athletics at Prairie View A&M and the broader HBCU community, inspiring a new generation of talent to follow in her footsteps.\nThis article sources information from Prairie View A&M University.",
