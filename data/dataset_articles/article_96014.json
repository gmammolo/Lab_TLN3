  "text": "MTU Cork power past University of Galway in Fitzgibbon Cup\nMTU Cork laid to rest the demons of last year’s 19-point Fitzgibbon Cup quarter-final defeat in Dangan with a powerful and potent performance in Galway tonight, where they were full value for their victory despite the home side’s tally of 15 wides in the hour.\nThe scoring power of MTU’s inside forward line was what leapt off the teamsheet as the main weapon for Pádraig Gould and his selectors and he certainly got a fine tune out of Alan Connolly in particular, who had a very fine night from frees and from open play.\nHowever it was in the back division where they really dominated, and this was made all the more impressive by the fact that Kerry star Evan Murphy was carried off with a little over 10 minutes played.\nMicheál Mullins, Ciarán Joyce and Sam Fitzgerald all had huge games for the underdogs, and they were central to MTU Cork establishing a solid platform in the first half.\nA clever bit of finishing from Liam Collins to beat Cathal Wilson inside the near post gave University of Galway a solid start in top of the ground conditions, but Alan Walsh struck a monster point in response, Joyce was on the mark with some trademark booming strikes from long range, and it fell to Brian Lynch to nudge them in front at 0-7 to 1-3 with 17 minutes played.\nGalway senior hurlers Niall Collins and Gavin Lee carried the fight for the home side through the second quarter but they were taking on water, culminating in Alan Walsh’s low shot to establich a five-point interval lead, 1-11 to 1-6.\nConnolly missed an excellent chance to really squeeze Galway when he fired for goal early in the second half, but his shot was at a good height for Cormac Kenny to make the save. By now MTU were winning most of the ruck balls and getting the better of things in the air, and while there was a brief rally that saw Liam Collins, Colm Molloy and Dan Bourke score in five minutes for UG, the middle ten minutes in the second have saw MTU Cork really open up to go six clear again.\nOnce again, the failure to add a second goal was crucial as three heroic blocks from Mark Hardiman kept UG alive, and a late run of points – including some sumptuous scores from Liam Collins – ensured a tense finish, albeit one that was eventually settled by Seán Walsh rounding off the scoring in stoppage time.\n: N Collins (0-8, 0-7f), L Collins (1-4), G Thomas (0-1), C Molloy (0-1), D Bourke (0-1).\n: A Connolly (0-8, 0-5f, 0-1 65), A Walsh (1-1), C Joyce (0-3, 0-1 65), D Healy (0-2), B Lynch (0-2), M Mullins (0-1), S Walsh (0-1)\n: C Kenny (Cappataggle); K Hanrahan (Loughrea), D Loftus (Turloughmore), M Hardiman (Athenry); T Killeen (Loughrea), G Lee (Clarinbridge), C Cunningham (Moycullen); I McGlynn (Kilconierin), L Leen (Clarinbridge); G Thomas (Castlegar), D Bourke (Ballinamere, Offaly), N Collins (Cappataggle); L Collins (Cappataggle), C Mitchell (Kilcormac-Killoughey, Offaly), C Molloy (Kilnadeema-Leitrim)\n: J Ryan for Cunningham (h-t), M Tarpey for Leen (46), D Comar for Molloy (49), T Leen (Clarinbridge) for McGlynn (59).\n: C Wilson (Newcestown); F O’Connell (St. Catherine’s); E Murphy (Causeway, Kerry), D O’Sullivan (Ballinhassig); S Fitzgerald (Clashmore/Kinsalebeg, Waterford), C Joyce (Castlemartyr), M Mullins (Whitechurch); M Finn (Midleton), R Walsh (Kilmoyley, Kerry); D Healy (Lisgoold), B Lynch (Ballinhassig), S Walsh (Fourmilewater, Waterford); A Walsh (Kanturk), A Connolly (Blackrock), J Cahalane (St. Finbarr’s).\n: E Varian (Glen Rovers) for Murphy (12), R McCarthy (Carrigaline) for O’Connell (43), R O’Sullivan (Newcestown) for Lynch (60+1), M Kelleher (Dicksboro, Kilkenny) for Cahalane (60+2).\nM Farrell (Roscommon).",
