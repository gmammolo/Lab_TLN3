  "text": "Malakai Black could be in store for a significant push in WWE, should he return to the promotion following his departure from AEW.\nPW Torch is reporting that Black has “influential people in WWE” backing him regarding a potential return to the company.\nBlack’s supporters within WWE see him as a “possible top singles act.” The report adds that Black sees WWE as more “palatable” with Triple H running things.\nThis report comes amid reports and speculation that Black is finishing his time with AEW if he has not already exited the company.\nBlack had reportedly told “some people in AEW” that he was “burned out” and is ready for time away from the ring, even suggesting a retirement.\nBlack signed with WWE in June 2016 and debuted as part of an NXT live event in January 2017. He would debut on TV in NXT UK the same month.\nBlack hasn’t appeared for AEW since November. More recently, House of Black members have been encouraged to forge their own paths on TV.",
