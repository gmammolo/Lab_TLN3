  "text": "It's no surprise that NFL WAGs often juggle family life, career, and supporting their husbands. But for Kelly Stafford, wife of LA Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, the mental toll of balancing it all was real when she took her sick daughters to the Rams' wild-card game against the Minnesota Vikings. Kelly explained how she was overcome with guilt for taking her sick children to the game, and how Matthew helped her move forward.Guilty of Battling Family ResponsibilitiesDuring a recent episode of The Morning After podcast, Kelly shared the emotional struggles she faced leading up to the trip. With her daughters feeling under the weather, she wrestled with the guilt of whether it was right to be on a flight and at the game.There was a huge guilt factor,\\\" Kelly said, reflecting on the flight. \\\"I was thinking, 'Should we even be on this plane right now with everyone surrounding us and all the players preparing for the game?' But Matthew said, 'Get your ass on that plane. We all need to be together'\\\" Her husband's reassuring words lifted her spirits, reminding her that sometimes family needs to stick together, no matter the circumstances.https://youtu.be/W3eT7gaTWnU?si=GYEg1vs9FLda1L86The Support of Matthew StaffordIt was Matthew’s mental support that helped Kelly feel confident in her decision to attend the game. Despite her doubts, Matthew’s insistence on their unity helped push past her guilt.Kelly recalled, \\\"That was such an incredible thing for me to hear because there was a little bit of like, ‘Should I just stay back with my children?’ Matthew was like, ’No, we will do whatever it takes. We are all getting on this plane. We are going to be together right now.\\\" The fact that Matt had been steady, as they all were going to get through this together.Acknowledging The LA HeroesAs for Kelly, she had sleep disorders because of the fires; however, what triggered her is when she got concerned about whether the fires are coming closer or the city she resides in, as it created fear in her that kept her from sleeping well, adding up her stress level.Her emotional messages about the LA firefighters and their sacrifices remind us to recognize the unsung heroes working behind the scenes.\\\"I just pray for the safety of these individuals and for God to come in the hearts of their families and protect them. We don't thank our First Responders enough ever. You know it always takes something like this for everyone to go to the firehouses and to thank them but really we should be doing that all the time.\\\"Kelly Stafford's journey through guilt, family struggles, and supporting her husband while battling personal demons shows the strength in her. She was able to push through because of Matthew and the importance of family, even when the obstacles were too overwhelming.Also read - Trolling Hits Hard for NFL WAGs, and Girlfriend of Braxton Berrios Alix Earle Is No Exception—Here’s How It Affected Her and How She Developed Thick Skin Amid Online Criticism",
