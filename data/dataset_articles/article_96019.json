  "text": "CHICAGO -- The Cubs and new outfielder Kyle Tucker avoided an arbitration hearing by agreeing to a $16.5 million contract for next season, according to sources familiar with the deal.\nTucker, 27, was scheduled to go to a hearing with the team after his camp filed for a salary of $17.5 million for 2025 while the team countered at $15 million. That won't be necessary, as the sides met near the middle, settling on the $16.5 million figure just a day before the team's fan convention gets underway in Chicago. Tucker is one of the headliners for the weekend.\nTucker, acquired by the Cubs from the Astros in a trade last month, compiled a 4.7 bWAR in just 78 games played last season for Houston due to injury, making his arbitration case a unique one.\nAn arbiter could have viewed him as a part-time player, and so the outcome of his contractual situation does have some precedent moving forward for players with a similar number of at-bats. It's what held up an agreement to this point. But the sides were able to quickly get past that before the potential ugliness of an arbitration hearing took place.\nTucker, who has a career .870 OPS, will be a free agent at the end of next season.",
