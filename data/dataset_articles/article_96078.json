The versatile defender has played at right-back and centre-back in his career, making him a good option to strengthen their backline.\nTrending A number of football fans have shared their opinions on the transfer on X.\nExpand Tweet A fan questioned the club's preference for signing Argentine players.\n\"Damn you're allowed to sign non argentine players btw\", they wrote.
