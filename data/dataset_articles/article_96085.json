However Freije say he always has seen her continue to grow as a player.\n\"All the time 'hey can I get in the gym' and I respond I am not going to tell you no\" said Freije. \"She just has that desire and drive to become better and better.\nAt this point in the season, Warner leads the Sabers in points per game with 10.9, assists per game with 4.4, and steals per game with 4.1; however despite the offensive point productin, Warner says that what matters most is being able to include others in the Sabers offense.\n\"F or me it's more important to find the open person,\" said Warner. \"If it's not me, I always look for a teammate\".\nIf you ask Warner's teammates, it is not how much she is able to produce for this seam, but how much effort she puts in for herself and each of her teammates.\n\"She goes into every game and she's just ready to play,\" said senior guard Addison Rosenkrans. \" She probably has one of the higher scoring averages on the team, but that's because she goes out there and she plays aggressive and she plays the game that she loves\".\nWarner is very involved in Susquehanna Valley athletics, playing soccer in the fall and flag football in the spring; the senior says just having that variety helps her see the court better.\n\"In a way both help me,\" said Warner. \"I n basketball seeing the open person knowing when to pass it just helps your IQ for sports.\"\nRosenkrans also added that playing with her both for basketball and soccer she has seen the chemistry translate to different sports.\n\"She anticipates the next pass and next move,\" said Rosenkrans. \"she's just very good bringing everything together and she's some of the glue that brings the team together\".",
