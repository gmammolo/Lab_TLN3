  "text": "Sports\nDan Orlovsky Drops Bold Prediction About Travis Kelce’s NFL Future\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are gearing up for a Divisional Round matchup against the Houston Texans on Saturday at 4:30 p.m. ET.\nThe Chiefs are now looking to win their third Super Bowl in a row, which has never been accomplished in NFL history. One important piece of this potentially happening is the star tight end, Travis Kelce.\nHowever, at 35 years old, there are rumors that Kelce could be contemplating retirement once the season concludes.\nDuring ESPN's \"First Take,\" analyst Dan Orlovsky thought it was a real possibility under certain conditions.\n\"Kelce's more than capable of being the difference maker,\" he said. \"I think he's got one great run left. I think if he goes and has that Vintage Kelce performance...and they go on to three-peat, I think retirement becomes a very real thing for Travis Kelce.\"\n.\n— First Take (@FirstTake)[@danorlovsky7]says Travis Kelce has \"one great run left\" in his NFL career\n\"If he goes and has that vintage Kelce performance ... and [the Chiefs] go on to three-peat, I think retirement becomes a very real thing.\"[pic.twitter.com/SVEWmohH4r][January 16, 2025]\nIf Orlovsky were right, then Kelce would be considered a lock for the Hall of Fame, as he already has 1,004 receptions, 12,151 yards and 77 touchdowns.\nHe's also been named First-Team All-Pro four times, made 10 Pro Bowl teams, and played a key role in all three of his Super Bowl wins.\nHowever, he has not confirmed if retirement will happen, but recently on \"The Stephen A. Smith Show,\" he admitted that he would reevaluate things after the season and that his girlfriend Taylor Swift has encouraged him to continue playing.\nRelated: Rob Gronkowski Backtracks, Picks New AFC Team to Make Super Bowl LIX\nCopyright 2025 The Arena Group, Inc.
