  "text": "A former Lancefield resident is preparing to represent Australia at this year’s Invictus Games in Canada.\nA bi-annual event, the Invictus Games aims to provide competitive, adaptive sport to support wounded, injured, and sick service personnel and veterans in recovery.\nOne of those heading to this year’s games in Whistler, Canada is Australian Defence Force (ADF) veteran Torben Louwen-Skovdam, who has a history and connection with the Macedon Ranges.\nMr Louwen-Skovdam served a 16-year tenure with the ADF and experienced a mental health breakdown in 2022, fuelled by undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder.\nFollowing this, he experienced intense anxiety attacks, increased alcohol intake, episodes of depression and suicidal ideation, and a subsequent medical discharge from the ADF in July 2024.\n“I grew up playing team sports … and I continued to play cricket and AFL throughout most of my military career. After my deployment to Sudan, I found myself withdrawing from my AFL club in Darwin,” Mr Louwen-Skovdam said.\nAfter beginning running and then avoiding social sport, Mr Louwen-Skovdam discovered the Invictus Games and realised it was something that he “really, really” wanted to do to aid with his recovery.\n“I needed the short-term fitness goal to support my physical rehabilitation, but also needed the purpose as I adjust to life outside Defence,” he said.\nWhile most connected with wheelchair basketball, Mr Louwen-Skovdam will also compete in indoor rowing, swimming, and biathlon at the upcoming games.\nHe said that his experiences growing up in Benloch and Lancefield – and seeing military convoys from nearby Puckapunyal pass through town – contributed to inspiring him to later join the ADF.\nHe and his two brothers were involved with the local Joeys, Cubs and then Scouts, later joining the army cadet unit at Braemar College.\nThe Invictus Games will run from February 8–16.",
