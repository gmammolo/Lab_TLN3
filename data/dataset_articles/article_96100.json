Sayles, Associate Director of Athletic Communications Billy Taylor Earns Hugh Durham Award Midseason Coaching Honor ELON, N.C. – Elon University men's basketball head coach Billy Taylor was recognized as the recipient of the Hugh Durham Award midseason coaching honor as announced by CollegeInsider.com on Thursday, Jan. 16. The Hugh Durham Award is presented annually to the top mid-major college basketball coach in Division I. Taylor has led the Phoenix to one of its best starts in its Division I history this season. Elon is 12-5 on the year for its best 17-game start in school history during its Division I era. The maroon and gold has also started 3-1 in the CAA for its best league start since 2017-18 and is currently unbeaten at 7-0 on its home floor at Schar Center. Among the notable victories this season for the Phoenix includes Elon's 84-77 win at Notre Dame on Nov. 22. It was Elon's first win over a Power 4 opponent since 2012 and its first win over an ACC foe since 2005. The Phoenix also received its highest NCAA Net ranking in school history at No. 82 and currently sits at No. 124, the second-highest in the CAA. The Phoenix has four players averaging double-figures in scoring and is one of the top defensive teams in the country. Elon ranks 11th in nation, holding opponents to 37.9 percent from the field. They are also ranked fourth nationally in rebounds per game (43.4) and sixth in the NCAA in rebound margin (+11.0). The Hugh Durham Award is presented annually to the nation's top mid-major coach. The award is named in honor of Hugh Durham who had retired at the end of the 2004-05 season. Durham is one of just twelve coaches to have led two different programs to the NCAA Final Four (Florida State in 1972 and Georgia in 1983). He is the only coach among that group to have led both schools to their lone Final Four appearance. The Phoenix is back on the court this evening at Drexel with game time scheduled for 7 p.m. -- ELON -- Print Friendly Version",
