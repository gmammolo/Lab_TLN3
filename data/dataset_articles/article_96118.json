  "text": "The Commanders are on a winning streak, the best since 2006 and their next destination is the Motor City. If you have tickets for the big game Saturday evening, it would be worthwhile to set aside some time to explore a few unique Detroit attractions and restaurants.\nThe Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation\n20900 Oakwood Blvd, Dearborn, MI 48124\nthehenryford.org\nThis is Detroit’s answer to the Smithsonian. Cars, planes, trains, this place has it all. Besides the big game, this may be the highlight of your trip.\nActive exhibits include: With Liberty and Justice for All, Driving America and Presidential Vehicles. This exhibit showcases various vehicles, including the horse-drawn carriage utilized by Theodore Roosevelt and the presidential parade cars that transported Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush. Among these, the standout vehicle is the 1961 Lincoln Continental Presidential Limousine, which tragically carried John F. Kennedy during his assassination on November 22, 1963. This vehicle underwent reconstruction and went on to be frequently used by Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon. Motown Museum\n2648 W Grand Blvd, Detroit, MI 48208\nmotownmuseum.org\nDetroit Institute of Arts\n5200 Woodward Ave, Detroit, MI 48202\ndia.org\nThe Detroit Institute of Arts is renowned for its exceptional art collection, which is widely regarded as one of the best in the United States. With over 65,000 works, the museum exhibits a diverse range of art, from mummies and modern art to African masks and Monets.\nBe sure to visit the Center for African American Art, within the DIA, where you can explore a remarkable gallery featuring 400 pieces created by African American artists in various media. Lafayette Coney Island\n118 W Lafayette Blvd, Detroit, MI 48226\nAmerican Coney Island\n114 W Lafayette Blvd, Detroit, MI 48226\namericanconeyisland,com\nThis is very Detroit, and visitors may be wary to try. Think Ben’s Chili Bowl, kinda. Both Lafayette and American are renowned for their hot dogs, served on steamed buns and topped with chili, onions, and mustard. Located next to each other, locals have a favorite - although it is pretty hard to tell the difference.\nThe Coney dog has its origins rooted in Greek immigrants who relocated from Coney Island, New York to Detroit during the early 20th century. These immigrants bestowed a Greek touch upon the American hot dog by incorporating a chili sauce infused with traditional Greek spices. Leo’s Coney Island is a favorite if you are staying in the suburbs.\nBuddy’s Pizza\n1565 Broadway Street, Detroit, MI 48226\nbuddyspizza.com\nEstablished in 1946, Buddy’s Pizza is renowned for pioneering the Detroit-style square pie.

Order ahead for carry-out.\nMike’s Famous Ham Place\n3700 Michigan Ave, Detroit, MI 48216\nIf you are a fan of Virginia ham, then this could be the ideal spot for you to satisfy your cravings while in Detroit. The original lunch counter has proudly stood here since the 1950s, and remarkably, not much has altered throughout the years.
