  "text": "By Ian Sacks ,\n17 hours ago\nSIOUX FALLS, S.D. (KELO) — The last time the Augustana hockey team played a home game in Sioux Falls, the calendar read November. The Vikings return to Midco Arena this weekend.\nThe Vikes are set to host Lindenwood Friday and Saturday night. The team is fresh off a sweep of eighth-ranked Colorado College the first weekend of 2025. Augie has lost just once over its last nine games and boasts a 7-1-1 mark in that stretch.\nThe team leads the CCHA in goals scored at 2.9 per game and sits second in goals allowed, yielding a hair under two a contest.\nWhile its been seven weeks in between home games, the Vikings are looking to channel their nerves and excitement into two wins.\n“I’m sure there’s going to be some butterflies with our guys and excitement to play it at home,” Augustana head coach Garrett Raboin said. “It’s been such a long time. We’re really excited, but we need to bottle that excitement and channel in the right way.”\nPuck drop is set for 7:07 p.m. Friday and 6:07 p.m. Saturday. Those two contests are the first two of eight home games between now and the end of the regular season.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
