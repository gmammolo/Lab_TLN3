  "text": "It’s been a rollercoaster season for Dak Prescott and the Cowboys, especially after missing out on the playoffs. But even with all the ups and downs, the Prescott family just got a big reason to smile. And it’s not on the football field in Dallas.\nTurns out, Prescott’s nephew, Jaymez Beaner, has officially joined the Angelo State Rams football team, and Dak couldn’t be prouder. He shared a story on Instagram, “Congratulations Nephew @_.jaymez @cobiloc29 Now y’all can have matching tattoos of a Ram lol.” Jaymez didn’t hold back either, sharing his own pic with the caption, “Go Rams💙💛 #Blessed.” It’s clear—Jaymez is ready to bring his A-game to the next level in the Lone Star Conference.\nView this post on Instagram\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nAngelo State has a pretty solid football program, with a history of producing some serious talent. The Rams’ alumni list includes former NFL players like Chris Ivory and Brandon Johnson. With coach Jeff Girsch leading the charge, Jaymez is joining a team with a strong legacy of success. It’s extra special for him since he’s repping his home state of Texas. Where the football community is all about passion and pride for their teams.\nBefore making the move to Angelo State, Jaymez put in work at Lovejoy High School in Lucas, Texas (not to be confused with the other Lovejoy in Georgia). Known for its competitive football team, Lovejoy helped shape Prescott’s nephew into the athlete he is today, showcasing his skills and determination on the field.\nJaymez is clearly pumped for this next chapter. He posted on X, saying, “#AGTG BEYOND BLESSED 💙💛,” tagging Angelo State’s WR coach @Coach_JJohnson and Offensive Coordinator @KevinKilmer. He’s definitely ready to put in the work and take his game to the next level with the Rams.\nAs for Prescott, there’s been plenty of buzz about what’s next for him in Dallas. While trade rumors are heating up, he seems focused on celebrating family wins for now. Whether QB Prescott stays with the Cowboys or finds a new home, it’s clear his nephew’s success is a proud moment for the entire Prescott crew.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nWill Dak Prescott's family pride overshadow the swirling trade rumors about his future with the Cowboys?\nHave an interesting take?\nThe trade rumors and Dak Prescott’s future\nWhile Dak Prescott’s family is celebrating his nephew Jaymez Beaner’s big move to Angelo State, the rumor mill around Prescott’s future with the Cowboys is still spinning. Even though the QB has been a cornerstone for Dallas, there’s been talk about him potentially being traded, or his contract being restructured to free up cap space for other players to be added to the Cowboys’ roster.\nA Heavy article fueled the speculations of trade, wondering if the Cowboys might look to move on from Dak Prescott. But ESPN’s Adam Schefter quickly shut it down, calling the idea “fantasy football.” He made it clear that it’s super unlikely the Cowboys would trade their starting QB, especially given Dak’s leadership and importance to the offense.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nDespite his injury woes this season, it can’t be denied that the QB pulled in decent numbers. I mean, he pulled in 1900+ passing yards in mere 8 games that he attended with 11 TDs to his name. While interceptions remained an issue for the QB, overall, the team has multiple other pain points that could be better focused on rather than trading Prescott and losing a key player.\nFor now, the QB seems focused on supporting his family and staying positive through the offseason. Whether he sticks with the Cowboys or explores other options, one thing’s for sure—the Prescott family’s football legacy is only growing, with Jaymez now part of the Angelo State Rams, and Dak couldn’t be prouder. Rest assured, the pieces of the puzzle will slowly fall into place as the Dallas team will unravel their strategies for the next season.\nHave something to say?\nLet the world know your perspective.\nChallenge Your Sports Knowledge!\nSolve the puzzle and prove your knowledge of iconic players, terms, and moments.\nDebate\nWill Dak Prescott's family pride overshadow the swirling trade rumors about his future with the Cowboys?",
