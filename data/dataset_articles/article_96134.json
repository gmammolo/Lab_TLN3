  "text": "Ipswich Town 0-2 Brighton: Mitoma and Rutter seal win for visitors\nKaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter were on target as Brighton claimed their first Premier League win since November at Ipswich.\nBrighton beat relegation-threatened Ipswich Town 2-0 at Portman Road to end a run of eight Premier League games without a victory.\nGoals from Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter after half-time were enough to seal victory for the Seagulls, boosting their hopes of European qualification.\nIpswich did threaten in the opening period as Liam Delap and Omari Hutchinson forced Bart Verbruggen into saves.\nBut Mitoma smuggled in an effort just before the hour mark before Rutter's clever flick made the points safe nine minutes from time, taking Brighton up to ninth in the table.\nThey are just four points behind sixth-placed Manchester City, while Ipswich drop back into the relegation zone on goals scored, behind Wolves.\nData Debrief: Game of two halves\nIpswich were more than competitive during the first 45 minutes at Portman Road, matching Brighton at 4-4 in terms of shots and losing the xG battle by a marginal 0.14-0.27.\nThe Seagulls upped their game in the second period, though, restricting their hosts to just one effort despite taking the lead with 30 minutes still to play.\nFabian Hurzeler's side racked up seven shots and 0.7 xG after the break, ultimately winning very comfortably.",
