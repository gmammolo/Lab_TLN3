  "text": "YORK, Maine — Several fire departments responded Tuesday to a parked camper engulfed in flames on Nubble Road in York Beach.\nYork Beach Fire Department was first dispatched before others assisted \"due to the gravity of the situation,\" according to a social media post from York Beach Fire. Crews contained the fire before it reached the home where the camper was parked.\nThe department said the home did not sustain major damage aside from cracked windows and burnt shingles on the roof.\nYork Ambulance also assisted and transported one person for smoke inhalation. No other injuries were reported.\nThe cause of the fire is still being investigated, though foul play is not suspected, according to officials.",
