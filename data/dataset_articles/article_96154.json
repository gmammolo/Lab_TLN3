  "text": "Gardner stuns with 'unbelievable' catch! | 01:23 Will Faulkner from Fox Sports January 17th, 2025 5:23 pm Australia has completed a clean sweep of England in the ODI series within the Women’s Ashes, leaving the visitors on life support for the rest of the series after an 86-run win in Hobart.\nWatch every ball of The 2025 Women’s Ashes Series LIVE with no ad-breaks during play on Kayo | New to Kayo? Get your first month for just $1. Limited time offer.\nA run-a-ball 102 from Ash Gardner in the first innings catapulted Australia to an incredible position of strength, after reeling at 4/59 with her arrival at the crease.\nHer maiden international century with the help of Tahlia McGrath (55), Beth Mooney (50) and Georgia Wareham (38* off 12 balls) meant that England would need to defy history and chase their highest-ever ODI target to win as the hosts set them a target of 309.\nGardner’s whirlwind knock brought the upmost praise from great Elyse Villani in the commentary box, highlighting her future potential as a leader.\n'Run out of words!' Gardner's timely 100 | 03:30\n“You can see that hunger and desire wanting to lead. She’s doing that at the moment through her actions, she’s having ownership of big moments, she’s done that a lot with the ball and now she’s starting to do that with the bat as well,” Villani told Fox Cricket.\n“Now that she’s got that going, I think now is the right time to have opportunities as a leader.\n“I feel as though Australia may have missed a trick in not making her at least the vice-captain with Tahlia McGrath.”\nNat Sciver-Brunt (2/51 off 10 overs) and Charlie Dean (2/53 off 10) proved the best of the bowlers for England, but quick flurry of runs from Wareham at the end proved a major thorn in their side.\nAt 1/1 and 2/29, England’s hopes of a miracle win already looked as good as gone, but half-centuries from Sciver-Brunt (61) opener Tammy Beaumont (54) gave them a slither of hope during the middle overs.\nOnce the Poms ticked over 200 on the scoreboard with six wickets still in hand, victory wasn’t entirely out of the realms of possibility. But a collapse of 6/22 ended their dream rapidly, with Alana King (5/46) claiming career-best figures for the second match in a row to roll through their lower order.\nKing was well-supported by Wareham (2/27) with the ball, who took the crucial wickets of Beaumont and Sciver-Brunt upon her addition into the attack. But Australia’s intent in the field was great all day, highlighted by player-of-the-match Gardner’s epic catch on the boundary to put England eight wickets down.\nAustralia’s 3-nil win now means that they are just one win off retaining the Ashes, with the three remaining T20’s worth two points each for a win in the multi-format series. A victory in the one-off Test to close out the series is worth four points.\nThe T20 series will start next Monday in Sydney at the SCG.\nRe-live our live blog of the third ODI between Australia and England below!",
