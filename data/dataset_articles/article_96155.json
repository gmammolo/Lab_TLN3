  "text": "Partizan ended its streak of three consecutive away games in the Euroleague with two wins, after outclassing Olimpija in Milan - 90:70.\nThe \"black and whites\" played a great game, and by the end of the month they will be the hosts twice - to Paris, so the city rival and Željko Obradović's team will have a great opportunity to join the fight for the playoffs.\nSterling Brown shone in the \"Arena\" with 27 points and seven rebounds, along with a great three-point shot (6-4). Karlik Jones added 24 with nine assists, and his namesake Tyreek had 22 points and seven rebounds.\nNikola Mirotic and Sammy Shields each scored 16 points for the losing team.\nPartizan has a record of 11 wins and 12 losses, while Milan has one win more after the 22nd round, and is in 10th place, the last place that leads to the playoffs.\nIn the Madrid derby, Olympiacos defeated Real Madrid - 96:86. Madrid was saved from a debacle by the relaxed guests from Piraeus.\nEvan Fournier scored 28 points. Saša Vezenkov had 13 points and nine rebounds, Nikola Milutinov had 13 points and eight rebounds.\nFor Real, Mario Hezonja had 19 points and seven rebounds, Dzanan Musa had 14 points.\nOlympiacos is the leader with 16 wins from 22 games, Real is ninth with 12 wins and 10 losses.\nLyon and Paris defended their home court. Lyon beat Alba after overtime - 96:89, while Euroleague newcomer Paris beat Maccabi Tel Aviv 96:83.\nAsvel was led to victory by Edwin Jackson with 18 and Theo Maledon with 17 points, followed by Melvin Ajinsa with 11 and Nando De Colo with 10 points.\nMatt Thomas stood out for the guests from Berlin with 20 points. Asvel is in 14th place with 10 wins and 12 losses, and Alba is in last place, 18th place with three wins and 19 losses.\nIn the next round, Asvel will welcome Barcelona, while Alba will host Bayern in Berlin.\nBonus video:",
