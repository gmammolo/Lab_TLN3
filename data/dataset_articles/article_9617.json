  "text": "As storms were moving into Delaware County on Wednesday night, Darby firefighters were making quick work of a house fire in the borough.\nCrews were dispatched about 7:25 to the 100 block of South Fifth Street for a fire.\nThe first arriving Station 4 engine reported a twin home with fire visible from the front of the house and extended porch.\nEveryone was safely out as firefighters used a handline to attack the flames, according to Darby Fire Company.\nThe working fire dispatch brought additional units as crews were able to keep the fire to the original home.\nNobody was injured and the incident was quickly brought under control, officials said.",
