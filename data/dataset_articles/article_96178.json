  "text": "By Shane Garry Acedera ,\n1 hours ago\nLos Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James had done it all. James has won four NBA championships, the inaugural NBA Cup, four MVP awards, four Finals MVP trophies, and an NBA Cup MVP. \"The King\" also has three Olympic gold medals and one Olympic MVP award and is the NBA's all-time scoring leader. That's just the tip of the iceberg.\nBut if you ask LeBron, none of those are the biggest achievements of his NBA career. What is, according to \"King James,\" is being able to play with his son in the league.\n\"That's like one of the biggest accomplishments and probably the number one accomplishment I've been able to do,\" said LeBron on the \"New Heights\" podcast. \"To work with your son, I've heard it from people, not only in sports, but I've heard it in business and all walks of life, and they say it's the greatest thing you could ever, ever have.\"\nBron played long enough for his son to become eligible to play in the NBA LeBron and Bronny are unofficially the 100th father-and-son duo to play in the NBA. However, James tandem is the first to ever play together on the same team and to see action in the same game. While that sounds ridiculous, it's not. LeBron was only 19 and the reigning NBA Rookie of the Year when his then-girlfriend Savannah Brinson gave birth to LeBron Jr.\nWith LeBron's incredible durability, he has played long enough to see his Junior get drafted by the team he plays for, despite the controversy. But for all the criticism that father and son have received, being able to wake up every morning and go to work with his son is the greatest achievement of Bron's career.\n\"To see him everyday grinding and going through the process of trying to become who he wants to be while I am sitting there, and just watching him and doing the things that he wants to do, and being able to just take it all in, it helps me get some of the minutes and hours and years back that I did not have with them because I was playing so much and on the road doing my own thing. To be able to get some of this time back, it's pretty special,\" added James.\nRelated: Joe Dumars explained the key difference between guarding Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan: \"Magic is a lot stronger than Michael\"\nNot everyone values the achievement like LeBron does While the four-time Champ's eyes sparkle when he talks about playing with Bronny, not many people understand what he's trying to say. Perhaps the best reaction to the father-son story came from Inside the NBA's Ernie Johnson, who, like LeBron Jr., got the chance to work with his dad but in the broadcast booth.\n\"As much fun as I have had through the years working with you guys and everybody else at TBS and TNT, nothing will ever match the opportunity I had in the 90s to work with my dad and to call ball games with my father shoulder to shoulder. And so for LeBron James, looking at his opportunity. Enjoy every second. Soak it in and enjoy every second because it doesn't get any better than that,\" he said .\nLike Ernie has worked with the best broadcasters, Lebron has played with the best players in the game. He has played on the biggest stages and has won almost everything that there is to win in the sport. However, nothing matches the opportunity to work with one's son or one's father. Only those fortunate enough get to understand its significance. But that does not make it less impressive.\nRelated: LeBron James recalls when he started with his famous powder pre-game ritual: \"I started throwing it up a little bit one time, and they got a little bit more excited\"",
