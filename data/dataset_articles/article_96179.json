  "text": "By John Jefferson Tan ,\n52 minutes ago\nMagic Johnson is undeniably one of the most fun and charismatic among the legendary figures in NBA history. He has a unique ability to bring joy and excitement to every moment he shares with his fellow NBA legends, making each gathering a memorable experience.\nDuring a private link-up with the great Julius Erving at The Brentwood Oasis in California in 2023, Johnson once again showcased his entertaining spirit. In front of a small yet enthusiastic audience, the Los Angeles Lakers icon delighted everyone by playfully mimicking some of \"Dr. J's\" most iconic plays.\nAs expected, Magic's performance was not just a plain imitation as it was infused with his trademark charisma and humor, captivating those in attendance, including Erving himself.\nMagic personally paid tribute to \"Dr. J\" Some may have already forgotten, but Johnson followed in Erving's footsteps as he made his way into the pros. After two seasons at UMass, Julius leaped into the pros and joined the ABA. Like \"Dr. J,\" Magic also spent two remarkable years at Michigan State and declared for the NBA Draft following a sensational NCAA championship run.\nTo this day, Johnson still vividly recalls the pivotal moment when Erving played a crucial role in guiding him with his big decision. During their mini-reunion, Magic took the opportunity to pay tribute to Erving, expressing his deep gratitude for the profound impact that \"The Doctor\" had on his life and career.\nIn front of his idol, \"Buck\" emphasized how Erving's guidance helped shape his path towards NBA superstardom. Together, the pair shared a wholesome and heartfelt moment.\n\" This dude here, [is] my hero right here, my hero. Thank you… See, everybody remember, Doc had to shoes before anybody. [Converse] The Docs. Then in college, I call him and say I'd like to talk to you because you left college early, can you give me some advice? He said I'm gonna do you one better, I'mma fly you to Philly and you gonna hang with me. Now, I'm in college… Then we go out… Man, [Dr. J] is first class right here. [There's] No Magic without this dude right here,\" Magic told Erving.\n\"Dr. J\" went from being Magic's hero to foe In a separate occasion, Johnson detailed how Erving influenced his decision to go pro in such a profound way. In his reflection, Magic opened up about feeling elated by the rare opportunity to be taken under the wing of the future Hall of Famer.\nTrue to form, Johnson wound up in the NBA and became one of the biggest names in the league, just like Erving. However, Magic admitted that it was kind of bittersweet to face \"Dr. J ,\" his mentor, in the NBA Finals. At that point, the legendary point guard put his admiration for Erving aside and prioritized what mattered most: winning an NBA championship.\n\"I was like 'What did you just say?' So he [Dr.J] said it again and so I hung up the phone and I'm howling and screaming 'Guess what everybody!! I'm going to Dr. J's house.' I'm going crazy, I couldn't hold it and I'm going around the street telling everybody that I'm going to be staying in Dr. J's house,\" the three-time MVP once recalled .\n\"So I get there and he's talking to me and I'm just mesmerized right? I don't care if I'm sleeping on the floor or on the couch, I sleep anywhere. So, I went to sleep, woke up, went to the Playoff game, and who would've ever thought, this was how it ended up as blessing. I ended up playing in the NBA championships in my first year as a rookie six or seven months later, I'm in the Finals against Dr. J,\" Magic recounted.\n\"I love that man but he was in between me and that NBA championship. I wasn't going to let him beat me and you know that series, I'm still the only player in NBA history to be named Finals MVP as a rookie,\" he added.\nRelated: LeBron James recalls when he started with his famous powder pre-game ritual: \"I started throwing it up a little bit one time, and they got a little bit more excited\"\nMagic and Doc are two of the most electrifying players of all time Johnson and Erving are not only celebrated as two of the greatest basketball players in the history of the sport, but they also stand out as remarkable entertainers who captivated audiences across the globe. Their extraordinary talent, combined with their charismatic personalities, created a lasting impact on the game.\nBoth icons are renowned for their flashy, graceful, and electrifying styles of play, which transformed the way basketball was viewed on a larger scale. With his incredible passing skills and court vision, Magic brought a sense of creativity and flair to the game. Similarly, \"Dr. J\" mesmerized fans with his acrobatic dunks and athleticism, pushing the boundaries of what was generally deemed possible on the court.\nAs great athletes, two icons played a significant role in popularizing basketball, elevating it from a niche sport to a global phenomenon. Their historic performances not only made the game more interesting and competitive but also infused it with a level of entertainment that drew fans in like never before.\nRelated: Magic Johnson breaks down what made Jerry Buss the greatest owner in NBA history: \"Once \"Showtime\" over with, we're gonna go upstairs and have a good time\"\n6",
