  "text": "By Matthew Wadleigh ,\n57 minutes ago\nThe Miami Hurricanes got some massive news with Georgia quarterback Carson Beck deciding to enter the transfer portal and come play for Mario Cristobal.\nWith Cam Ward leaving for the NFL, Beck immediately comes into Miami and becomes the QB1 and a big name to watch in 2025. Moreover, the Hurricanes roster looks that much better, although there are still holes to fill if they want to compete for a College Football Playoff spot next season.\nWhile Beck's move sparked plenty of criticism, NFL Draft expert Mel Kiper Jr. is all aboard the decision, as he explained during an of NFL on ESPN alongside Field Yates.\n\"I couldn't be happier,\" Kiper stated while clapping. \"The decisions that players make sometimes will leave you scratching their head, I mean that's why I'm losing my hair...I'm ripping my hair out with decisions that these guys make. When you have time to play college football, I'm begging you, take it.\"\nKiper also mentioned it doesn't matter where players are drafted, but rather how prepared they are for the jump to the NFL.\n\"It doesn't matter where you go, it's how well-prepared you are for what's going to be asked for you to do in the National Football League,\" Kiper continued.\nHe also mentions that they need to play at a \"Consistency high level\" in the NFL, and that's what it's all about at the next level.\nIt's a different approach than many have made with transfers, but Kiper has a valid point. Beck could improve his draft stock and he is already making a ton of money in the reported NIL deal at Miami.\nIf it works out, Beck could be a big name in the 2026 NFL Draft, and he could last much longer in the NFL if he refines his skills this season at Miami.",
