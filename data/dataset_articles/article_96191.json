  "text": "There is a new big man in Los Angeles, one who hopes he can have a major impact on any team he plays for.\nThe LA Lakers have signed center Trey Jemison, waiving guard Quincy Olivari , tweaking their roster with a move they hope can pay off.\nCenter is a position the Lakers are light at, and there have been trade rumors linking the team with the likes of Jonas Valanciunas .\nJemison has experience on the Wizards, Grizzlies and Pelicans, and joins after being waived in New Orleans just days ago.\nPhoto by Nick Cammett/Getty Images Trey Jemison has the physical tools Trey Jemison has the physical tools to succeed in the NBA, standing at 6 10″, and claims to be ‘elite’ at doing the dirty work battling to win the ball back for his team.\nSpeaking to the Pelicans podcast earlier this season, Jemison compared his physique to former Lakers big man Dwight Howard .\nHe explained: “These are genetics, I was blessed with Dwight Howard shoulders from a young age.\n“I try to use them to set those screens and handle my business.”\nJemison has signed a two-way deal with the Lakers and hopes for an opportunity to help the team, in their efforts to make the play-offs and make an impact .\nTrey Jemison aims high Trey Jemison added that he sets his targets high, and aims to lead the whole NBA in offensive rebounds.\nHe explained: “I have a goal, and my mindset is to set high goals, and if you fall short, you probably did good no matter what.\n“I want to lead the league in offensive rebounding. If I do that, I give my team more chances to get open shots.\n“I’m not here to score the ball, we have amazing scorers in our team, and to get them to shoot the ball one more time would be great.”\nNow on the Lakers, there will be more pressure and attention on Jemison than he has experienced before.\nDuring his senior year at UAB, Jemison led the Conference USA in rebounds per game, showing he can back up his talk.\nTransferring that to the NBA is more difficult, with 13 rebounds in a game his best return, while his season average on the Pelicans was 4.3 per game – yet as he points out, there is nothing wrong with aiming high.",
