  "text": "The Miami Heat have seen many legends come and go from their organization over the years and one current star is dreaming of following in their footsteps.\nThe Heat are a side in the middle of some drama at the moment with the future of Jimmy Butler shrowding much of the good work the side is producing.\nIn Butler’s absence Tyler Herro has highlighted how Bam Adebayo has stepped up as a leader in the side, he is now the most experienced player on the roster.\nAdebayo has been with the Heat since being picked up as the 14th overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft and he has been a strong pair of shoulders to rely on over the years.\nPhoto by Soobum Im/Getty Images Adebayo would love to have Heat Jersey retired Despite being just 27 Adebayo plays with the poise and nouse of an NBA veteran and is hoping to wear just one jersey for his entire NBA career.\nAdebayo wears the number 13 jersey with pride and is dreaming of having it retired one day by the heat.\nHis on-court skills which see him average 15.9 points, 9.6 rebounds and 4.6 assists this season combined with his brilliant personable skills have seen him become a huge favorite in Miami among both fans and teammates.\nThe three-time NBA All-Star is not afraid to share his knowledge with up-and-coming Heat talent , something that not all stars like to do.\nBam who made the 2024 All-Defensive First Team explained how he wants to finish his career as a Heat legend when he spoke with Andscape : “What creeps in my mind is when I start seeing my name just pass somebody for third, just pass somebody for fourth, you start creeping up and my goal was I want to be top three, top two, even one in all categories in Heat history.\n“So, for me to do that, I got to be here long enough. I’ve been here eight years and looking forward to continuing being here.”\nAsked whether he deserves a statue like Heat legend Dwyane Wade he said: “Do I deserve a statue? You dream of that. Obviously, that comes with championships, all other good stuff. But I do dream of seeing my jersey in the rafters.”\nPhoto by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images Stars to have Heat jerseys retired If Adebayo does have his jersey retired he will be joining some pretty legendary company at the Heat.\nWhile it will likely take a potential championship win or similar to guarantee this his loyalty to the franchise should not be overlooked.\nIn a time where players move around constantly through the trade market loyalty is hard to find.\nHeat retired jerseys\n1 – Chris Bosh 3 – Dwyane Wade 10 – Tim Hardaway 32 – Shaquille O’Neal 33 – Alonzo Mourning 40 – Udonis Haslem In an interesting coincidence, the Heat have already displayed the 13 jersey worn by Adebayo. However, this was done to acknowledge the former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino.",
