  "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers have confirmed the signing of free agent center Trey Jemison.\nThe LA Lakers made a roster move, waiving Quincy Olivari to make room to sign center Trey Jemison .\nJemison is a player who likes to do the dirty work, and claims to be ‘elite’ at what he does.\nIt’s an interesting move for a Lakers team who lack depth at the center position, adding a player who is in his second season in the NBA.\nHe was cut recently by the New Orleans Pelicans, who were prioritising the development of rookie center Yves Missi , a first round draft pick .\nPhoto by Justin Ford/Getty Images Trey Jemison achievement Trey Jemison’s best stretch in the NBA in his career came last season during a stint with the Memphis Grizzlies .\nHe set a record in the process with a 24 point game against the Washington Wizards, the team for who he made his NBA debut.\nJemison’s score ended up being the highest number ever scored in the NBA by a former Univerity of Alabama at Birmingam (UAB) graduate.\nIt was a proud achievement for the player, and a sign of what he can do on the offensive end of the court too.\nTrey Jemison has now set a new record for points in an NBA game by a former UAB player with 18 (and counting) 👀 https://t.co/PU4ZXGP34I\n— UAB Men's Basketball (@UAB_MBB) March 13, 2024 View Tweet What Trey Jemison did well Memphis Grizzlies head coach Taylor Jenkins spelled out what he liked about Jemison’s career best performance last season.\nHe explained: “I thought he did a really good job of screening and rolling, something we’re continuing to work with him on, the chemistry with the guards out there. I thought he did a good job of really getting hits because they were staying with their own, and that freed up our guards quite a bit\n“I’m really impressed. Overall, I’m proud of him, career high and all of that stuff, but he is doing the little things that impact winning.”\nLeBron James recently said that the Lakers are continually trying to improve their roster , and this latest move shows there is some work being done.\nJemison will get an opportunity to show what he is capable of, and he can’t ask for more than that.\nIf he can bring his peak Grizzlies form to the Lakers with some consistency, then he has a chance to be successful in LA.",
