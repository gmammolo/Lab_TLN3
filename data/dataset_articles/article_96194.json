  "text": "Detroit's success is largely due to its impressive running game. Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery are both in their second year with the Lions, but they have formed one of the best running back tandems in the league.\nA duo as good as this one deserves a nickname, and Gibbs and Montgomery have a good one.\nPast running back duos have received nicknames including \"Thunder and Lightning\" or \"Smash and Dash.\" Gibbs and Montgomery, though, have a more specific nickname.\nThe two are going by \"Sonic and Knuckles,\" a modern nickname for a modern running back room. Here is how Gibbs and Montgomery got their moniker.\nSN'S PLAYOFFS HQ: Live NFL scores | Full NFL schedule | Updated NFL bracket\nJahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery nickname, explained\nLions running backs coach Scottie Montgomery is the one who first gave the duo the nickname, which is inspired by the video game series \"Sonic the Hedgehog.\"\nIn the series, Sonic is the main character. The blue hedgehog is known for his speed. Knuckles is one of Sonic's rivals, a red echidna known for his strength.\nIn the case of Gibbs and Montgomery, Gibbs, 22, represents Sonic as the faster of the two, while Montgomery, 27, is Knuckles due to his toughness and physicality.\n\"'As you can see, if you watch David, he is a huge fan of cartoons and Disney channels and 'Sonic and Knuckles.' And speed and then also the brashness of Knuckles,\" said Scottie Montgomery, via Benjamin Raven of mlive.com. \"And, of course, I knew about it because I have children, right? So 'Sonic and Knuckles,' I think it works well. They love it, so I'm gonna run with it.\"\nThis nickname is a change from last year, when Gibbs and Montgomery went by \"Peanut Butter and Jelly.\" But the shared nickname of \"Sonic and Knuckles\" gives a better idea of who the two are as players and how they complement each other.\n\"I would say it's pretty accurate, but I would say in some ways, we could change roles, depending on situations,\" Gibbs said of the nicknames.\nLions head coach Dan Campbell described the pair as \"like brothers,\" with the elder Montgomery as the big brother displaying a protectiveness over Montgomery. Still, even though Gibbs sees those roles and the Sonic and Knuckles nicknames as accurate, he emphasized their versatility as well.\n\"We both can do everything, so it's hard for defenses to scheme up against us,\" Gibbs told ESPN. \"I mean the production speaks for itself, too.\"\nMORE NFL PLAYOFFS:\nHaving Sonic and Knuckles on your team isn’t all it’s cracked up to be 😆\n— NFL on CBS 🏈 (@NFLonCBS)[pic.twitter.com/Vz2lVvUPNJ][November 26, 2024]\nCBS even featured the video game-turned-movie characters of Sonic and Knuckles in a video featured Tuesday on social media to preview the Lions' Thanksgiving game against the Bears.\nGibbs and Montgomery showed up to Detroit's Thanksgiving game wearing Sonic and Knuckles-themed jackets and with the two mascots alongside them. Each running back also is wearing customized cleats in the game that are Sonic and Knuckles themed. This will likely draw a fine from the NFL, but the running backs likely don't mind.\nTry and keep up!\n— Detroit Lions (@Lions)[pic.twitter.com/6gTLWK1PNS][November 28, 2024]\nNFL DRAFT NEWS:\nLions RB 2024 stats\nJahmyr Gibbs | David Montgomery | |\nGames | 17 | 14 |\nRushing Attempts | 250 | 185 |\nRushing Yards | 1,412 | 775 |\nTouchdowns | 16 | 12 |\nYards per Attempt | 5.6 | 4.2 |\nBoth Gibbs and Montgomery finished in the top 30 in the league in rushing yards, and they were both among 10 players in the NFL with at least 12 touchdowns.\nLast year, Gibbs and Montgomery combined for 1,960 rushing yards and 23 touchdowns.",
