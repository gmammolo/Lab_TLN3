  "text": "The matchup is set, and there will be MVP storylines galore when the Baltimore Ravens travel to Buffalo to face the Bills in the divisional round of the AFC playoffs.\nThe Ravens avoided embarrassment and moved onto the AFC Divisional Round of the playoffs with a convincing 28-10 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers at M&T Bank Stadium on Saturday night. Buffalo secured an impressive win over the Denver Broncos. Ahead of Sunday’s gigantic matchup, both quarterbacks have avoided any MVP discussion, choosing to focus on the team.\nLamar Jackson & Josh Allen are certainly doing their best to take the attention away from themselves and the MVP showdown this Sunday #BillsMafia #RavensFlock pic.twitter.com/wnFLvvuWHc\n— Matthew Bové (@Matt_Bove) January 15, 2025\n“We’re just trying to win.”\nLamar on not buying into hype around the game: pic.twitter.com/P2ZeImrx64\n— Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) January 15, 2025\nLast week, Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson was 16-21 passing for 175 yards, two touchdowns, and a 132.0 rating. Jackson rushed 15 times for 81 yards, while Derrick Henry carried the night, logging 186 yards on 26 rushing attempts and two touchdowns.\nBaltimore’s defense held Pittsburgh to 280 yards of offense, with just 29 yards rushing on the ground. Najee Harris finished with six carries for 17 yards, and Jaylen Warren had two for six yards on the night. The Steelers had the football for just 20:27.\nFor Buffalo, quarterback Josh Allen was 20-26 passing for 272 yards (10.5 avg), two touchdowns, and a 135.4 passer rating. As a runner, Allen had eight carries for 46 yards (5.8 avg,) while James Cook had 23 carries for 120 yards rushing (5.2 avg) and one touchdown.\nThis matchup will feature the two leading MVP candidates in a game that should be a must-see on the NFL on CBS.\nThis week, it should also create tons of content for ESPN, NBC, NFL Network, and other platforms.",
