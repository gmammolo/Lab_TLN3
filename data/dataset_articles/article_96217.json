  "text": "By Michelle Kaufman ,\n1 hours ago\nInter Miami continued to fill out its 2025 roster on Thursday with the signing of Argentine defender Gonzalo Lujan to a contract through the 2027 season with an option for 2028.\nLujan, 23, comes from Argentine top-flight club San Lorenzo, where he made 97 appearances. He also has played 15 matches for the Argentina Under-23 team and was on the 2024 Argentine Olympic team under first-year Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano.\n“Bringing in a young and versatile defender like Gonzalo Luján will be important for the upcoming 2025 season,” said Inter Miami president of football operations Raul Sanllehi. “He provides our First Team squad with quality depth and reinforces our defensive unit, while his versatility will be a valuable asset as he can perform in several positions across the back line.”\nLujan, who is 5-11 and plays center back and fullback, said: “It is a privilege to be able to join a top organization like Inter Miami. I’m excited to begin this new stage in my career and will work hard to help my teammates and the club have a successful 2025 season.”\nLujan is the third Argentine player to sign with Inter Miami in the past 48 hours. On Wednesday, the club re-signed goalkeeper Óscar Ustari to a one-year contract through the 2025 season. The 38-year-old, a friend and former Olympic teammate of Lionel Messi’s, spent the last few months of the 2024 season with Inter Miami.\nAlso joining Inter Miami was forward Tadeo Allende, who comes on a one-year loan from Spanish LaLiga club Celta de Vigo through the end of 2025.\nBoth Ustari and Allende are awaiting visa paperwork and may not be available for the first preseason game Saturday in Las Vegas against Mexican champion Club America (10 p.m.).",
