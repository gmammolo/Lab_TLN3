  "text": "The Rigby football team equaled rival Highland for the most successful run in Idaho Class 6A history this past season.\nThe Trojans joined the Rams as the only team in classification history to win four state titles in six years (2019, 21, 22, 24). Highland did it from 1997 to 2022.\nSo understandably, Rigby dominated the annual 6A All-Southeastern Conference team with 30 selections alone. This included sweeping all four of the major categories.\nSenior offensive line Feki Pouha was named the Player of the Year. The running back tandem of senior Jerzey Duenes and junior Amani Morel were the Co-Offensive Players of the Year. Senior defensive back Parker Graham, who just signed with Idaho State, was the Defensive Player of the Year. And last, but certainly not least was Armando Gonzalez, who was the Coach of the Year. The Trojans hadn’t won a single state championship prior to his arrival in 2017.\nJunior Owen Golding was a multiple-time first-team selection for them at wide receiver and kick return. Joining him on the first team were junior Jake Flowers (QB), senior Kasyn Thomas (WR), senior Bryson Youngstrom (TE), senior Braiden Byrd (OL), senior Kannon Oswald (OL), senior Dayton Boone (OL), senior Casen Sylvester (DL), senior Gauge Larsen (DL), junior Ethan Hickman (LB), senior Gaige Jones (LB), junior Cannon Korth (DB) and junior Kobe Walker (DB).\nMadison boasted 26 selections, including senior Barkley Beck being both a first-team running back and defensive back.\nAnd Thunder Ridge rounded it all out with 18 picks. Junior wideout Preston McDaniel was their lone first-team selection.\nThe full teams are listed down below.
