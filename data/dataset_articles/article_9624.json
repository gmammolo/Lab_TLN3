  "text": "Workers Rescued After Tunnel Collapse Source : ABPLIVE AI In a late-night rescue, all 31 workers trapped in a collapsed industrial tunnel in Wilmington were safely brought to the surface, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD).\nThe incident occurred just before 8 p.m. Wednesday near the intersection of South Figueroa Street and Q Street. Initial reports indicated that at least 15 workers were unaccounted for, sparking a massive emergency response.\nAuthorities now confirm all 31 individuals have been rescued and are safe.\nEmergency Response In Action The workers were believed to be as far as six miles from the tunnel’s only known entry point at 1701 North Figueroa Street, a challenging scenario that required a highly coordinated effort. Over 100 LAFD personnel, including specialised Urban Search and Rescue teams trained in confined-space operations, were deployed to the site.\nHelicopter footage captured the intense scene as crews worked tirelessly through the night. Emergency responders could be seen gathered around a large open shaft — the critical point of access for the rescue.\nWorkers were brought up in groups of eight using a crane, each emergence met with visible relief. In a heartwarming moment captured by NewsChopper, several of the rescued workers embraced after reaching the surface, overwhelmed by emotion and gratitude.\nMayor Karen Bass Posts: Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass shared the news on X, (formerly Twitter):\nLAFD has just reported that all workers who were trapped in the tunnel in Wilmington are now out and accounted for.\nI just spoke with many of the workers who were trapped. Thank you to all of our brave first responders who acted immediately. You are L.A.'s true heroes. pic.twitter.com/6hdAwbH1MI\n— Mayor Karen Bass (@MayorOfLA) July 10, 2025",
