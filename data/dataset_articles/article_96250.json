  "text": "Tessa Blanchard comments on the working relationship between WWE and TNA Wrestling.\nTessa Blanchard recently returned to TNA Wrestling, and just recently, TNA began an official working relationship with WWE. Under the relationship, WWE NXT Superstars will continue to appear on TNA wrestling programming, and vice versa.\nTessa Blanchard recently discussed the working relationship between TNA and WWE NXT, telling Dominic DeAngelo of SEScoops what she thinks of some of the young stars of the WWE developmental program. First, she discussed her history with Stephanie Vaquer in CMLL.\n“Stephanie Vaquer and I, we have a history in CMLL over in Mexico. We’ve had some banger matches out there. So her and I were actually chatting and we’re like, ‘Hmm, maybe we’ll get to see each other in the ring again one day,’ and I know that would be just a treat.”\nBlanchard also highly of Kelani Jordan and Sol Ruca. Ruca has appeared on TNA programming in the past.\n“There’s some girls that I’m not familiar with personally, but watching their work, I watch it and I’m like, ‘Gosh!’ There’s Kelani Jordan. She’s absolutely phenomenal in the ring. Sol Ruca, she’s phenomenal in the ring and just seeing the way that these ladies move – there’s a lot of promise over there, and I hope that some of the ladies in the TNA locker room get to mix it up with a lot of them.”\nBlanchard recently discussed talks she had with TNA about a possible return to the promotion in 2024. Read more here.\nBlanchard will wrestle Jordynne Grace at TNA Genesis. Check out the full card for that event here.\nClick here to learn more.",
