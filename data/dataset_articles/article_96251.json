  "text": "On Tuesday, January 28, the Shenendehowa Central School District will host the Shaker Blue Bison Basketball teams for a triple-header event.\nWhile both school’s boys and girls varsity teams are currently ranked in the upper echelon for New York State’s Class AAA, the on-court action won’t be the only highlight.\nShenendehowa’s former standout athlete and 2016 graduate, Kevin Huerter, will be in attendance for a jersey retirement ceremony in between the games on Jan. 28, honoring his contribution to the school’s athletics.\nHuerter is in his seventh season in the NBA, and third as a member of the Sacramento Kings.\nFor the evening, there will be one admission price of $4, which will be good for any or all of the three games.\nPer Shenendehowa’s press release, this event will have a limited capacity and will likely sell out. GoFan tickets are available at https://gofan.co/event/2299570?schoolId=NY1384.\nThe boys’ junior varsity game between Shenendehowa and Shaker will tip-off at 4 p.m., followed by the girls’ varsity game at 5:30 p.m. The boys’ varsity matchup is scheduled for 7:15 p.m.",
