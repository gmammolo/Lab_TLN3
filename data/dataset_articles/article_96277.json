We're here to help you sift through it all.\nUsing FanDuel Research's daily NBA projections as a guide, here are some NBA player prop bets that look appealing on FanDuel.\nPlease note: lines and projections are subject to change throughout the day after this article is published. All NBA odds come from FanDuel Sportsbook.\nToday's Best NBA Player Prop Picks\nPhoenix Suns at Washington Wizards\nTyus Jones 2+ Made Threes (-145) / 3+ Made Threes (+210)\nBradley Beal (ankle) is listed as doubtful for tonight's competition against the Washington Wizards. His absence should allow Tyus Jones -- whose minutes have been down -- to reclaim a meatier role. That's just one of the reasons why I like Jones' made threes prop tonight.\nJones is averaging 2.1 three-point makes (3PM) for the season. He's made at least two threes in 57.9% of games and has nailed three triples in 36.8% of games -- up from the 32.3% implied probability on these +210 odds.\nWashington serves as the easiest matchup in basketball. They rank fourth in pace and dead-last in defensive rating. They're also coughing up the most three-point attempts (40.4) per game.\nJones is netting 2.2 3PM and has made at least two threes in 66.7% of games versus top-10 pace teams. When playing a bottom-10 defense, Jones has made two threes at a 66.7% rate and three three-pointers at a cushy 55.6% rate.\nIn 10 games without Beal this season, Jones averaged 2.7 3PM on 32.2 minutes. He made two threes in 80.0% of the games in the split and drained three threes in 50.0% of those contests. With Beal's absence colliding with the soft matchup, this could end up being a fruitful night for Jones.\nLos Angeles Clippers at Portland Trail Blazers\nJames Harden Over 35.5 Pts + Reb + Ast (-113)\nJames Harden played only 23 minutes in last night's 59-point rout over the Brooklyn Nets, but he still managed to tally 38 combined points, rebounds, and assists (PRA) in his abridged appearance. I like him to hover around that PRA range again in tonight's contest against the Portland Trail Blazers.\nHarden is averaging 35.4 PRA. He's been extra special against weak competition and seems primed to ravage Portland's 27th-ranked defense.\nHere's a look at Harden's PRA output versus the bottom 10 defenses in the NBA: 38, 33, 48, 31, 54, 37, 48, 34, 49, and 43 PRA. In the split, he has averaged 41.5 PRA and cleared 35.5 PRA at a 70.0% rate. Even his floor in this sample (31 PRA) is encouraging.\nJames Harden - Pts + Reb + Ast\nThe Blazers let up the seventh-most points, eighth-most assists, and 12th-most rebounds per game. The road Clippers are favored by just 7.0 points, putting Harden in a spot to get decent run as there isn't a ton of blowout risk. Notably, 13 of Harden's last 25 games have been decided by at least 20 points, yet he's still managed to consistently stuff the stat sheet.\nThe kicker? Portland surrenders the 10th-most free throw attempts per game and the fourth-most FT attempts on their home court. Unsurprisingly, Harden shoots the sixth-most charity stripe attempts in the league.\nHere's a look at his PRA output against clubs that rank in the top eight of most free throws allowed: 43, 38, 54, 38, 31, 37, 36, 37, and 34 PRA. That's good for a 38.7 PRA average and a 77.8% hit rate on the over at this line.\nCleveland Cavaliers at Oklahoma City Thunder\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander to Record 6+ Assists (-125)\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander is converting potential assists to the stat sheet at the lowest rate in the NBA (among eligible players).\nWhile he's netting 6.0 dimes per game, he should be averaging 7.0 assists based on the league average conversion rate. Positive regression could be forthcoming, so I like him to dish out at least six assists in tonight's marquee game against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nThe Cavs come in with the eighth-best defensive rating. SGA has played 12 games against top-eight defenses. In this split, he's averaging 6.3 dimes and has notched at least six assists in 66.7% of games.\nCleveland surrenders the 10th-most assists per game to guards. Both Cleveland (6th) and OKC (8th) play at a quick pace, leaving us with a slate-high 233.0 over/under.\nThere should be a lot of points to go around, and Cleveland has top defensive guards who will look to turn SGA into a passer.\nOur NBA projections expect SGA to dish out 6.5 dimes in this one.\nGet a [No Sweat Token](https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/navigation/nba?ampSessionId=1737042091444&DeviceId=97f43a98-a0eb-4590-b07c-8d731f5f599b&SessionId=undefined&DeviceId=undefined) to use on a 3+ leg SGP wager on either of the NBA on TNT games happening tonight, January 16th!
