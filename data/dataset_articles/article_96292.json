  "text": "The Brief Kevin O'Connell wants to stay with the Vikings on a contract extension and has been talking with the Wilf ownership family O'Connell is 34-19 in 3 seasons, but 0-2 in the playoffs O'Connell says fans should be proud of the season Sam Darnold had, with career-highs in yards (4,319) and touchdowns (35) EAGAN, Minn. (FOX 9) - Kevin O’Connell’s least favorite day of the year is when he has to make roster cuts before the start of the regular season.\nHis second least favorite? The day after their season is over. This year, that was Tuesday after they lost to the L.A. Rams 27-9 in the NFC Wild Card Playoffs Monday night. O’Connell reflected on the 2024 season Thursday with reporters at TCO Performance Center, and addressed his potential future in Minnesota.\nThe Vikings won 14 games, but they’re also now 0-2 in the playoffs under O’Connell. He walked into an extremely emotional locker room Monday night, a season abruptly over with bigger aspirations unfulfilled.\n\"Did not end the way any of us envisioned. The finality of it all is probably the thing that stings the most. Nobody expected it to be over when it was,\" O’Connell said.\n‘I love our ownership’ What we know: O’Connell is under contract with the Vikings through the 2025 season, but could get a contract extension this offseason. Does he want to stay in Minnesota?\n\"I do. I’ve had great dialogue with our ownership this week. Anything beyond that I’d prefer to keep those discussions internal,\" O’Connell said.\nWhat we don’t know: Is there tension between O’Connell and the Wilf family? There were no contract talks after the Vikings went 7-10 and missed the playoffs last year. A report surfaced before they faced the Lions in the regular season finale that multiple teams would be calling to check on O’Connell’s availability in a trade. O’Connell was asked Thursday if there is any tension between himself and the Wilf’s. He didn’t say no.\n\"What I would say is I love being the head coach of the Minnesota Vikings. I love our ownership, I have a great relationship with our ownership,\" O’Connell said. \"Not only the way they support us and believe in us, but also the impact they have on our players and ultimately where we all want to go together.\"\nO’Connell talks quarterbacks Why it matters: A former NFL quarterback himself, O’Connell helped resurrect Sam Darnold’s career. Darnold is a Pro Bowler after throwing for more than 4,300 yards and 35 touchdowns, both career-highs. He also had his two biggest failures in the two biggest games of the season.\n\"I think Sam should be very proud about the season he put together. I think he learned a lot about what he can be in this league. I envisioned him having that kind of year,\" O’Connell said.\nDarnold can become a free agent in March, while J.J. McCarthy is back on the field throwing. We don’t yet know what the 2025 quarterback room will look like, but it will include McCarthy after they invested the No. 10 overall pick in him.\n\"I’m very excited where J.J. is at. He’s right where we hoped he would be at this point,\" O’Connell said.",
