  "text": "Rescue efforts in the Red Sea have brought new hope as four more survivors, three crew members and a security guard, were pulled from the water on Thursday, following the deadly Houthi attack on the Greek-operated vessel Eternity C earlier this week.\nAccording to maritime security sources, the newly rescued individuals had been adrift for over 48 hours before being spotted and saved.\nTheir rescue brings the total number of people recovered alive to ten, including eight Filipino sailors, one Indian national, and one Greek security guard.\nSearch teams continue to scour the area for eleven others still missing after Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for sinking the vessel. The Iran-aligned group also claimed they were holding some members of the crew, though this has not been independently verified.\n“This fills us with more courage to continue to search for those missing, as the Greek vessel operator requested, and shows that our search plan was correct,” said Nikos Georgopoulos, an official with Diaplous, a Greece-based maritime risk management firm supporting the rescue operations.\nThe Eternity C, a commercial vessel flying a Liberian flag but managed by a Greek company, was struck by a missile on Tuesday while transiting the southern Red Sea, a region that has grown increasingly volatile due to repeated Houthi attacks on shipping lanes.\nInternational maritime organisations and naval forces have condemned the assault, calling for an immediate end to hostilities against commercial vessels.\nRescue teams, bolstered by naval support from several countries, continue to search the surrounding waters amid ongoing hopes of finding more survivors.",
