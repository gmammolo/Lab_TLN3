  "text": "Boxing\nAnthony Joshua Finds New Foe: Next Big Fight Announced After Tyson Fury's Retirement\nIt is crystal clear that the envisioned biggest match in the history of boxing between Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury will never happen again following the total pullout of Fury from boxing. Amid that, Joshua has quickly been paired up with another fierce opponent which is expected to gain more ground.\nA shocking retirement from the \"Gypsy King\" some days ago is a negative signal revealing the end of his career, and particularly an end to a dream match with Joshua. Fury retired from boxing two months after his second defeat to the current heavyweight champion Aleksandr Usyk.\nSaudi Arabian adviser at the Royal Court under the rank of Minister and the current Chairman of the General Entertainment Authority, Turki Alalshikh, had Fury-Joshua on his list of fights to see in 2025 and expectations were high, but, as it happened that the match will not longer happen, Turki quickly makes a tough opponent for Joshua.\nSpeaking to TalkSport, Alalshikh revealed intentions to make Anthony Joshua vs. Deontay Wilder a reality.\n“I want to see Joshua and Wilder now,” Alalshikh said. “If Tyson is not available, why not Joshua and Wilder?\"\nJoshua and Wilder are greater fighters, and they have equally had their worst moments in the ring. In just six years, between 2019-24 Anthony Joshua lost 4 bouts in 6 matches. Moreover, Wilder has lost more matches in recent times, the first of which was against Tyson Fury in their trilogy.\nJoshua vs Wilder was one of the biggest fights of Joshua’s prime. Negotiation issues plagued this matchup when both men were undefeated, and now they are both coming off devastating knockout losses. It’s bittersweet, but the allure is still there.\nIt is doubtful if Anthony Joshua will want to see himself in the ring with Wilder. The American boxer has never been his interest. Besides, AJ needs a bigger boxer like the \"Gypsy King\" to rebuild his portfolio.\nWill AJ versus Wilder match ever happen?",
