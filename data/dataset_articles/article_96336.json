  "text": "On Jan. 9, FHSAA’s 1A District 16 teams were scheduled to meet in the Southernmost City for district duals action. Despite an eight-team pool, only two showed up. Perhaps that was because the host team, Key West, had already won 15 straight district duals. That number now stands at 16 after the Conchs defeated Coral Shores 58-18.\nCoral Shores won points in three weight classes. At 106 pounds, Costa Tuttle won his match by forfeit while David Beltran (157) and Andrew Grgek (285) pinned their opponents.\nThe Conchs claimed the remainder of the matches, with wins from Alexander Holtcamp (113), Jacob Ferguson (120), Lazaro Diaz (126), Abram Canet (132), Elvis Garcia (138), Kyle Condella (144), Dames Searcy (150), Michael Guzman (165), Alfredo Corrales (175), Sanford Horn (190) and Malik Cooper (215).\nBoth teams advance to the next round of duals, scheduled for Jan. 16 at Key West’s Bobby Menendez Gymnasium.\nThe Lady Conchs also saw action on the mat last week. They traveled to Coral Reef High School, where Sheyla Figueira won first place in the 105-pound class. Teammates Maria Halushka and Isabella Cosme both took the third-place spots at the podium in their weight classes, and though they fell short of reaching the podium, Sunisa Kuhn and Wenxin Yu both won matches at the tournament.",
