  "text": "Jannik Sinner’s fate will be decided by CAS, which will issue the Clostebol doping issue ruling in a closed-door hearing, in mid-April.\nThe Italian is currently focusing on the 2025 Australian Open, where he has just reached the 3rd round, but it is inevitable for him and his team not to think about the CAS ruling, especially given WADA’s tough request for a 1-2 year suspension for the young Italian, in an interview with Daily Maverick.\nSome weeks ago, USADA Chief Executive Travis Tygart (who prosecuted cyclist Lance Armstrong) expressed on the case involving the ATP No.1, stressing that he does not believe Jannik is a doper.\n\"If Jannik is a doper, which I don't believe he is based on the facts that have been made public, then a not guilty verdict was a perfectly appropriate outcome based on the rules and the facts,\" he explained.\nAnd just a few hours ago, following Jannik's access to the 3rd round of the Australian Open 2025, his coach Darren Cahill, who will leave the Italian's team at the end of the season, reposted the USADA chief's interview on X to underline his belief that his player is totally innocent of the facts and that their split does not depend on the Clostebol doping issue.\nHead of US Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart.\n— Darren Cahill (@darren_cahill)\nA good read.[https://t.co/CMONPM8bVI][January 16, 2025]\nTygart, also with Daily Maverick, already before Iga Swiatek's issue, talked about a wide range of doping issues, including the Italian's case, dismissing the idea that Jannik had somehow received preferential treatment from the ITIA-appointed tribunal.\n\"Unlike TMZ 23 in China, the rules, and if you're specifically talking about the Jannik's case, the rules were followed. The transparency was upheld. Why wasn't Sinner provisionally suspended? Well, he was. But he appealed and they revoked it. That's within the regulations.\nCompare that to the Chinese cases. They've never even provisionally suspended athletes and the regulations are absolutely clear on that kind of positivity. You have to be suspended. You can challenge it and an independent hearing officer can revoke the order, which is what happened in the Sinner case. So the outcome of the case was no finding of fault,\" he said.\nWe recall Jannik was found positive for Clostebol at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, failing two doping tests. The Italian was later found innocent by an independent tribunal commissioned by ITIA. WADA subsequently announced an appeal to CAS against this ruling, asking for a 1-2 year suspension for the ATP No.1.\nJannik Sinner",
