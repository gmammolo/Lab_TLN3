  "text": "TGL was created with the goal of the PGA Tour achieving even greater power on the golf scene and stopping LIV Golf and its progress. The creators of this story, Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and the PGA Tour, seem to be doing a good job, at least judging by the TV ratings.\nThe intention of the creators of this league was to attract a younger population, and to present something completely different to golf fans in general. It is noticeable that golf has been losing viewership in recent years, which has set off red alarms for key organizations. TGL is just one step towards raising the rating, and we have no doubt that both sides will start many projects in the future, wanting this sport to be side by side with others.\nTV ratings: TGL creators can be happy\nTGL was created even for those who do not follow golf, with the intention of attracting them. It is interesting that Tiger Woods' debut in this league was watched by more than a million viewers, which is an increase of 9% compared to the first matches of the league. It is impressive that Woods' match had more viewers than the NBA on TNT.\nTiger Woods' team did not impress, experiencing an absolute debacle. However, Tiger didn't seem worried. He looked quite cheerful with a smile on his face. This great golfer is aware that TGL could represent a new era in this sport.\nESPN has obviously done a good job, just like the PGA Tour, and it seems that this partnership could bring a lot of positive things for both parties. The continuation of the competition could arouse even greater interest from fans, who are hungry for something new in the world of golf.\nTGL is becoming an increasingly recognizable story, with Woods and Rory having a big credit in this story. Let's hope they can be just as successful in the weeks and months ahead.\nTiger Woods",
