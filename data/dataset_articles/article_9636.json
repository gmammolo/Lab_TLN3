  "text": "Los Angeles, California – A late-night collapse inside a massive wastewater tunnel project in Wilmington trapped 31 construction workers underground on Wednesday, in a harrowing incident that shines a light on the dangerous and often unseen labor behind Los Angeles’ infrastructure ambitions. The collapse occurred along a 7-mile-long tunnel being constructed as part of the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a $630.5 million project intended to modernize the city’s aging sewage system. According to the Los Angeles Fire Department, a section of the tunnel collapsed around 8:55 p.m., isolating the workers as much as six miles south of the tunnel’s sole access point near the 1700 block of North Figueroa Street. Despite the alarming nature of the collapse, all 31 workers were rescued alive and without visible injuries, fire officials said. The workers had managed to scramble onto a pile of soil beyond the collapse and were shuttled out several at a time by tunnel vehicle. Emergency crews, including all of LAFD’s Urban Search and Rescue teams, were mobilized in what officials described as a rapid and coordinated response. Four additional workers had entered the tunnel after the collapse to assist their colleagues, who were hoisted to the surface roughly an hour later. The project has now been placed on indefinite hold while authorities investigate the cause of the collapse. “This is a dangerous job,” said Chelsea Fernandez, whose husband was among those rescued. “Every day he goes in there, we don’t know if he’s going to come out.” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass praised the emergency response, calling the first responders “L.A.’s true heroes.” She visited the site shortly after the incident and spoke with several of the rescued workers. The tunnel, located 450 feet below ground, is designed to transport treated wastewater from the Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant to the Pacific Ocean. It is part of a broader regional effort to overhaul Los Angeles’ water infrastructure and increase recycled water use, a decades-long project that city leaders hope will eventually provide half of L.A.’s drinking water. Constructed by Flatiron Dragados as part of the Los Angeles County Sanitation District’s Clearwater Project, the tunnel was intended to replace two aging sewage lines built in 1937 and 1958. Tunneling had been projected to finish by April 2025, with full activation scheduled for January 2028. That timeline is now in question, as city and county officials seek to determine what led to the collapse and how to ensure it doesn’t happen again. For now, the rescue stands as a rare stroke of good fortune in a situation that could have ended much differently.",
