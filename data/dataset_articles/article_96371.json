  "text": "Premier League: Ipswich 0 Brighton 2 (Mitoma 59, Rutter 81) A first league win in nine for Brighton and the latest hard truth for Ipswich. The home side had been under little serious threat until Kaoru Mitoma, profiting from loose defending, scored just before the hour but were never in the game after that.\nThey were smothered by visitors who chose to do anything but sit back on their lead, Georginio Rutter doubling the lead and ensuring a swift return to the relegation zone for Kieran McKenna’s team.\nBrighton cruised home and, with players newly fit, will hope to have drawn breath for a march up the table.\nThe prematch levels of respect between McKenna and Fabian Hürzeler had been considerable: two of the best young managers around oversee teams to be proud of, and there was another clear point in common.\nREAD MORE Both sides might wonder how their seasons would look if draws more regularly became victories; Brighton had tied six of their winless run while Ipswich, freshly out of the bottom three on goal difference, could point to the recent dropping of two points late on at Fulham.\nLast time out at Portman Road, though, they had torn into Chelsea and claimed the kind of win that can transform a season. The idea must have been for a similarly roaring start here but Brighton, composed and methodical, called the early tune and kept an often raucous venue quiet.\nBrighton's Kaoru Mitoma (centre) celebrates with Pervis Estupinan after scoring the opening goal against Ipswich. Photograph: John Walton/PA Their ample possession hinted at threat more than exuding it, a well-timed tackle by Kalvin Phillips on Yasin Ayari snuffing out their only approximation of an opening in the first 20 minutes.\nPhillips, a surprising goalscorer in the FA Cup win over Bristol Rovers, had retained his place in midfield. It meant a rare relegation to the bench for Sam Morsy, the Ipswich captain, and they struggled to get a grip in the veteran’s absence. Carlos Baleba, imperious as ever, controlled the engine room and the hosts were not helped by a series of cheap concessions from the back.\nAs usual, Ipswich looked threatening when they did land on the front foot. They struck the first serious blow in the 23rd minute when Nathan Broadhead, carrying the ball across Brighton’s half before turning inside, executed a low curler that Bart Verbruggen turned wide with a strong hand. Proceedings had warmed up, Liam Delap ending a strong run with a marginally less taxing effort that Verbruggen could hold.\nIt was as heady as the first half action, its tempo respectful rather than rapid, ever became. By half-time Ipswich were consistently posing the greater danger, Verbruggen saving smartly from the returning Omari Hutchinson’s 20-yarder and two promising Wes Burns breaks going to waste. Delap barrelled into Jan Paul van Hecke twice; the third time he skipped past the Dutchman before Joël Veltman thundered in fairly.\nCould anyone break the impasse that had taken hold under a luminous yellow moon? Amid a bright Ipswich re-emergence Delap nibbled off the ball at Veltman, continuing what had become a running spat, and was booked.\nA VAR check clears Georginio Rutter's goal for Brighton. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images Brighton responded by finally contriving a glimmer, Jacob Greaves reacting smartly to block from Simon Adingra.\nJoão Pedro, heckled by Ipswich’s fans for perceivedly milking another knock before half-time, piqued their ire further by going over limply in the box and then summoning rather more force to clatter in late on the goalkeeper Christian Walton.\nNow the night had some edge, Burns almost plunging the knife into Brighton when snatching a shot wide from Jens Cajuste’s long throw.\nSo it was a sickener for Ipswich when Brighton found a breakthrough from their first genuine opportunity. It came when Greaves misjudged a Veltman pass down the right for Ayari, only helping it into his opponent’s path. Ayari centred for Matt O’Riley, who quickly found Mitoma for a shot that went through a possibly unsighted Walton.\nHürzeler went for the kill with three changes, Luke Woolfenden clearing from near the line during a spell of desperate defending. João Pedro, showing his more edifying side, then spun and drew a spectacular save from Walton. The pendulum had swung decisively.\nIpswich barely left their own half in the 20 minutes after conceding; they could not match Brighton’s power off the bench and one of the replacements, Rutter, cleverly turned in a long-signposted second after a left-sided free-kick had been poorly dealt with. Ipswich had long since faded. – Guardian\nSign up for push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Listen to our Inside Politics podcast for the best political chat and analysis",
