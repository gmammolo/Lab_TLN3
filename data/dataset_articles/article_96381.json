He is the only Cal player to win this honor.\nMack was a 3-time First Team All-Pac 10 performer and he went on to be a first round selection by the Cleveland Browns in the 2009 NFL Draft.\nMack played 13 seasons in the NFL and was named to the NFL 2010 All-Decade Team.\nHe was a 7-time Pro Bowl selection and a 3-time second-team All-Pro.\nBefore attending Cal, Mack was a standout football player and wrestler at San Marcos High School.\nLast year he was inducted into the San Marcos Athletic Hall of Fame and in 2023 Mack entered the Santa Barbara Athletic Round Table Hall of Fame.\nThe 2025 College Football Hall of Fame Class will officially be inducted during the 67th NFF Annual Awards Dinner on Dec. 9 at the Bellagio Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.",
