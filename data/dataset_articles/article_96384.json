  "text": "The Kansas City Chiefs cheerleaders have a unique and heartfelt way of commemorating their Super Bowl appearances-by getting tattoos. This tradition has evolved into a cherished ritual for the squad, ensuring that their unforgettable moments on the NFL's biggest stage are permanently etched in their memories. It's not just about the game; it's about the bonds formed and the experiences shared.\nIn a TikTok video shared after the Chiefs' 2024 Super Bowl victory, veteran cheerleader Stefanie Hill unveiled this \"crazy tradition.\" Hill explained, \"We have this crazy tradition where we get tattoos every time we go to a Super Bowl.\"\nFilmed in March 2024, the clip captures Hill and her fellow cheerleaders arriving at Definitive Tattoo Gallery, the same studio they visited the previous year. \"Last year, we went to Definitive Tattoo Gallery and we absolutely loved it, so we're back!\" she added enthusiastically, showcasing the excitement that surrounds this annual event.\nRelated:\nFor Hill, this visit marked her fourth Super Bowl appearance and her fourth tattoo. She proudly displayed the Roman numerals inked on her foot from previous championships: Super Bowl LIV, Super Bowl LVII, and Super Bowl LVIII. Now, she was there to add another milestone to her collection-Super Bowl LIX. Reflecting on her journey, Hill shared that this tattoo would be particularly significant as she had just completed her \"sixth and final season\" with the Chiefs cheerleading squad. This adds a layer of nostalgia, making the experience even more poignant.\nThe inspiring tradition of Chiefs cheer squad\nThe video also showcased the camaraderie among the team as they filled the tattoo studio, laughing and sharing stories. While this tradition has become a beloved part of their Super Bowl experience, Hill made it clear that participation is entirely optional. \"It is not a requirement to get a tattoo,\" she emphasized, highlighting the personal choice involved in this meaningful ritual. Many of her teammates chose to join in, with some opting for matching designs while others expressed their individuality through different tattoos.\nThe Kansas City Chiefs cheerleaders have become a vibrant part of the team's culture, celebrating their achievements in ways that go beyond the sidelines. Their tattoos serve as lasting reminders of the hard work, dedication, and unforgettable moments they've shared on football's grandest stage. Each design tells a story, representing not just victories but the spirit of teamwork and the joy of being part of something greater than themselves. As the Chiefs continue their journey in the playoffs, all eyes will be on the cheer squad to see if they keep this heartwarming tradition alive.",
