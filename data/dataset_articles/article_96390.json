  "text": "Sports\nMassive Trade Proposal See Lakers Lands $28M Scorer\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are expected to be one of the more active teams ahead of the NBA trade deadline. Following the move to land wing defender Dorian Finney-Smith, many around the league are wondering what's next for Los Angeles.\nThe Lakers are in a unique spot where they can either go all-in for another star or just add more talent around the edges. In this new trade scenario, Los Angeles does the latter and builds up more depth for the postseason around stars LeBron James and Anthony Davis.\nAfter looking over the new CBA restrictions and using the Spotrac trade machine, here is what a deal could look like. The trade would be between the Lakers, Charlotte Hornets, and Utah Jazz.\nLakers receive: Jordan Clarkson, Walker Kessler, and Seth Curry\nHornets receive: Jarred Vanderbilt, Patty Mills, and a 2025 second-round draft pick\nJazz receive: Gabe Vincent, Jalen Hood-Schifino, Christian Wood, protections off the 2027 first-round draft pick that Los Angeles owes Utah, a 2029 first-round draft pick, and a 2026 second-round draft pick from the Hornets\nThis move helps the Lakers in a multitude of ways. First off, they get a dynamic scorer in Clarkson, who can take some of the burden off others in the second unit.\nIt would be a reunion for Clarkson as he spent the first few seasons of his career with the Lakers. For the season. Clarkson has averaged 16.0 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 3.8 assists per game.\nClarkson is the type of microwave scorer who could help take over a playoff game or series. Additionally, he can handle running the offense for Los Angeles since they would be moving Vincent in this deal.\nKessler would give the Lakers some additional size up front, alongside Davis. Los Angeles has lacked depth in the frontcourt all season and the former Auburn Tigers product could help.\nWhile he doesn't space the floor, Kessler can provide strong minutes as the backup center or running mate with Davis. For the year, he has averaged 10.8 points, 11.3 rebounds, and 1.5 assists per game.\nAnd finally, Curry would be a bonus for depth purposes. The sharpshooting 3-point scorer could add more firepower to the Lakers offensive attack.\nEven if he were to only play a few minutes, Curry could add some threat on the offensive end. The veteran has only seen limited minutes this season with Charlotte so he likely wouldn't be expecting more from Los Angeles.\nWhile a move like this could be beneficial for the Lakers, it's not without risk. Losing a point-of-attack defender in Vincent would hurt as well as Vanderbilt.\nBut the Lakes have their sights set on another title and this move would put them closer to achieving that goal.\nMore news:Heat Fans Turn on Jimmy Butler, Take Massive Shots at Star With Mural\nFor more Lakers and NBA news, visit Newsweek Sports.\nRelated Articles\n2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC.\nThis story was originally published January 16, 2025 at 3:10 PM.",
