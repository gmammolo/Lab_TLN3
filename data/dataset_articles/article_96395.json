  "text": "Fata's Cowboys Crush Cappiello's Ladies\nNível 24\n: Blinds 20,000/40,000, 40,000 ante\nMario Fata raised to 80,000 from early position before Candido Cappiello three-bet to 200,000 from the hijack. After it folded back to Fata, he four-bet shoved for roughly 1,150,000. Cappiello called to put himself at risk.\nCandido Cappiello: Q♦Q♣\nMario Fata: K♠K♥\nCappiello started the hand with a stack of around 1,000,000 and needed to find a queen if he was to remain in the tournament. The dealer put out a board of 8♥6♥4♣J♣A♠ which kept Fata's Cowboys ahead, sending Cappiello to the rail close to the end of the day.\nJogador | Fichas | Progresso |\n---|---|---|\n|",
