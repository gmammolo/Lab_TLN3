  "text": "Next week, the Kiev team will face Galatasaray in the Europa League.\nDynamo Kyiv crushed CSKA 1948 in the last friendly match of the winter training camp in Turkey. The meeting in the city of Belek ended with a score of 1:4.\nIn the first half, Nikolai Shaparenko and Vladislav Vanat scored for the “white-blues”.\nAt the start of the second half, the club from the city of Sofia reduced the deficit thanks to the efforts of Mario Ilievski. However, then the charges of Alexander Shovkovskiy scored twice more – goals were scored by Nazar Voloshin and Vanat, who scored a double.\nFull video of the match CSKA 1948 – “Dynamo”\nThis is the second victory of the day for the “white-blues”, as earlier the Kyivians defeated Slovenian “Maribor” (2:0). Before that, at a training camp in Turkey, “Dynamo” lost to German “Magdeburg” (1:3), won over Romanian FCSB (2:1) and snatched a draw against Polish “Widzew” (1:1).\nOn Tuesday, January 21, Dynamo will play its first official match in 2025. The Kyivans will compete with Turkish Galatasaray in the seventh round of the main stage of the Europa League. After that, on January 30, Shovkovsky's team will finish its European Cup campaign with a match against the Latvian club RFS.\nThese matches will no longer have tournament significance for the Kyivans, because they prematurely lost their chances to reach the Europa League playoffs after six defeats in a row. Currently, Dynamo occupies the last, 36th place in the overall standings of the main round of the Europa League and remains the only participant in the tournament that has not yet scored a single point.\nRecall that the Kyivans went into the winter break as the leader of the Ukrainian Premier League (UPL). “White-blue” (43 points) are 5 points ahead of “Oleksandria” and 10 points ahead of “Shakhtar”, which has a match in hand.\nIn the first match of the “spring” part of the UPL, the Kyiv team will host “Karpaty”. The base date for the matches of the 18th round of the elite division of the Ukrainian championship is February 22.",
