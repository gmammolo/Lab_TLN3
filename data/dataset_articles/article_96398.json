  "text": "Blades sign Alberta U18 AAA scoring leader Halat to WHL Scholarship and Development agreement\nSaskatoon, SK – The Saskatoon Blades are happy to announce the signing of 2009-born forward Adam Halat to a Western Hockey League (WHL) Scholarship and Development agreement.\nThe Okotoks, AB product was acquired by the Blades on December 27, 2024 from the Calgary Hitmen in exchange for 19-year-old forward Lukas Hansen.\n“Adam has dynamic skill, soft hands, and high-end offensive creativity,” said Blades director of scouting, Dan Tencer, “He’s a guy that you can count on to make everyone around him better. He’s one of those guys that you know will bring that down the line in a WHL uniform because he competes with everything he has and isn’t afraid of pressure or big moments.”\nHalat is the leading scorer in the Alberta Elite Hockey U18 AAA League (AEHL) as a member of the Okotoks Oilers. The left-handed shot is averaging just under a goal-per-game as a 15-year-old rookie, owning 23 goals and 45 points in 26 games. Halat is tied with 2008-born Blades prospect Kohen Lodge for the most points-per-game in Alberta U18 AAA at 1.73.\nThe Blades want to welcome the Halat family to the organization and city of Saskatoon, and look forward to working with Adam under the guidance of head coach Dan DaSilva’s staff.",
