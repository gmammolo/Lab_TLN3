  "text": "Sports\nPenn State Reacts to Saquon Barkley News Ahead of Rams-Eagles Playoff Game\nThe No. 2 seed Philadelphia Eagles are preparing to host the No. 4 seed Los Angeles Rams on Sunday afternoon in the divisional round of the NFL playoffs, continuing their quest for a spot in Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 9 in New Orleans.\nAhead of the matchup, the Maxwell Football Club, home to several prestigious awards, announced that Eagles running back Saquon Barkley has been named the recipient of the Maxwell Football Club Bert Bell Award, which honors the NFL Player of the Year.\nIn response to the announcement, Penn State, where Barkley had a legendary collegiate career, shared a brief four-word message celebrating his achievement.\n\"Best in the League.\" Penn State posted.\nBest in the League.\n— Penn State Football (@PennStateFball)[#WeAre]x[@Saquon][pic.twitter.com/DS75FOLUUg][January 16, 2025]\nBarkley is in his first year with the Eagles and has already made a major impact, achieving several historic milestones along the way. He became the franchise's all-time single-season rushing leader, led the league in rushing, and secured his second career playoff victory last weekend when the Eagles defeated the No. 7 seed Green Bay Packers 22-10.\nThis season, Barkley has rushed 345 times for 2,005 yards and totaled 14 touchdowns, while averaging an impressive 5.8 yards per carry.\nAhead of their matchup with the Rams, Los Angeles head coach Sean McVay offered high praise for Barkley, especially remembering his dominant performance in their earlier meeting in November, where he rushed for 255 yards and scored twice, while breaking off for two 70-plus yard touchdown runs in the outing.\n\"That's the thing that makes Saquon so special,\" McVay said. \"He's patient and he hits you for a couple of those runs, but if he gets clean to the second and third levels, he's such a slash runner and he has the speed to finish. That's why he's such a dynamic player. I think our sense of urgency will be appropriate for the task at hand this week. We love it and we're looking forward to it, but we have a ton of respect for this group.\"\nRelated: Saquon Barkley Calls Philadelphia \"Biggest Blessing\" in Fresh Start with Eagles\nCopyright 2025 Athlon Sports.
