  "text": "Ipswich Town vs Brighton and Hove Albion. Premier League.\nPortman RoadAttendance29,403.\nIpswich 0-2 Brighton: Joao Pedro avoids red card as Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter ends Seagulls' winless Premier League run\nMatch report and free highlights as Brighton end eight-game Premier League winless run with 2-0 victory at Ipswich; Joao Pedro avoids red card for clash with Christian Walton; Kaoru Mitoma gave Brighton lead six minutes later before Georginio Rutter sealed win\nThursday 16 January 2025 22:27, UK\nBrighton ended their eight-game winless run in the Premier League with a 2-0 win over Ipswich - in a game where the decision not to send Joao Pedro off was the major talking point.\nWith the Seagulls frustrated by Ipswich at the start of the second half, Brighton forward Pedro appeared to jump into home goalkeeper Christian Walton off the ball while trying to catch a back-pass.\nReferee Tony Harrington delayed his decision before brandishing a yellow card, with VAR agreeing with the call.\nThe incident became even more significant when, six minutes later, former Brighton goalkeeper Walton let Kaoru Mitoma's shot go through his hands and into the net to break the deadlock of a slow-starting game.\n\"I've not watched it back. I think he's left a little bit on the goalkeeper. I think he knows what he's doing,\" said Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna. \"It's football, it happens.\n\"The referee gives the yellow card and dealt with it. It's not something that we're going to cry about too much.\"\nAsked about the incident, Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler said: \"He comes too late, yes. He has no bad purpose, he doesn't want to hurt him. I don't see a red card for this challenge.\"\nBrighton then made changes to consolidate their authority on the game and one of the substitutes in Georginio Rutter doubled the lead with a clever flick from a set-piece. VAR checked whether Lewis Dunk was obscuring Walton's view as the shot went in, but deemed the Brighton defender onside.\nThat second goal was particularly damaging for Ipswich as it took them back into the relegation zone on goal difference. McKenna's side failed to make use of a slack Brighton first half, with Nathan Broadhead, Liam Delap and Omari Hutchinson all denied by solid Bart Verbruggen stops.\nFor Brighton, however, the victory lifts them into the top half and ends their longest winless run since December 2021, when Graham Potter's Seagulls went 11 games without a win.\nThe big incident - have your say!\nPedro has been there before...\nSky Sports' Sam Blitz:\nIt is not the first time Joao Pedro has been involved in an incident where his intent is being questioned.\nOn December 27, Pedro avoided a red card against Brentford despite swinging his elbow out at Brentford's Yehor Yarmoliuk. The Brazilian did not make contact with the midfielder, even though the Laws of the Game state that \"attempting to use excessive force\" warrants a sending off.\nHow does this compare to this situation? It's a tough one to call and referee Tony Harrington did take his time in making his mind up, despite calls from Ipswich players and fans at Portman Road to take the strongest action possible.\nPedro appears to jump into Walton - which could be deemed excessive - but is the Brighton forward trying to get out the way of the goalkeeper? As soon as Harrington branded the yellow card, it would have been difficult for VAR to overturn it.\nBut it still feels right to say that Pedro is lucky. Another referee may have taken a harder sanction.\nMcKenna: First goal changed the game\nIpswich manager Kieran McKenna:\n\"I thought we had more threat and got the ball in better areas. I think we finished the first half strongly, started the second half even better.\n\"And we were the better team until their first goal which was their first real threat on our goal. We defended the situation not as well as we would have liked and we should have stopped the goal. And it changed the game really.\n\"From our point of view, I think the first goal changed the game disproportionately to what we would have wanted. But I think we could have found a better reaction than what we did.\n\"But it looked like our confidence dropped in the game. Theirs certainly went up and they have very good substitutes who brought them confidence and they were the better team in the last 30 minutes.\"\nHurzeler: Brighton should get some confidence back\nBrighton manager Fabian Hurzeler:\n\"Overall we controlled the game, we defended quite well. Especially in the second half we managed to get more chances. We stayed in our structure and played more vertical in the second half and felt we deserved the win.\n\"The game always opens when you score a goal because the opponents have to react, defend higher, press higher and gives us more space in behind - we were able to use that.\n\"For me it's very important that we focus on and trust the process. We had better performances in the last eight games and we didn't win the games. Today, we played okay, we were solid but it was not the best performance from us.\n\"This win should give us self-confidence and the belief back.\"",
