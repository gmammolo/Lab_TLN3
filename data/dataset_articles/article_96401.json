Premier League.\nOld TraffordAttendance73,722.\nManchester United\n3\n- A Diallo (82nd minute, 90th minute, 94th minute)\nSouthampton\n1\n- M Ugarte (43rd minute own goal)\nMan Utd 3-1 Southampton: Amad Diallo hat-trick saves Ruben Amorim's side after Saints led into 82nd minute\nMatch report and free highlights as Manchester United's Amad Diallo produced an astonishing hat-trick with all three goals coming late in the game to beat Southampton at Old Trafford; win lifts Ruben Amorim's side to 12th; Saints remain 10 points adrift\nThursday 16 January 2025 22:21, UK\nAmad Diallo's dramatic late hat-trick turned the game around as Manchester United beat Southampton 3-1 at Old Trafford.\nIt is 91 years since United last lost more than three home league games in a row but when Manuel Ugarte's own goal left Ruben Amorim's side behind to the Premier League's bottom club at the break, a fourth looked likely. But Amad had other ideas.\nHe forced home the equaliser in the 82nd minute before playing a delightful one-two with Christian Eriksen in the 90th minute to put United ahead. Amad then latched onto a characteristic Saints defensive mishap to clinch the match-ball and transform the night.\nIt was a struggle for much of the evening but the victory lifts United above three London clubs into 12th and builds on that FA Cup win over Arsenal at the weekend. For Ivan Juric and Southampton, it is a desperate blow. They remain 10 points from safety.\nAlejandro Garnacho did miss a big chance to slot United in front early on but that was a rare opening for Amorim's tentative team with Southampton looking the better side in a first half in which only Andre Onana came out with any credit for the home side.\nThe United goalkeeper kept out the lively Kamaldeen Sulemana, who tormented Leny Yoro throughout, before producing a sensational double stop to deny Tyler Dibling and Mateus Fernandes. But Onana was helpless to prevent Ugarte's own goal.\nSouthampton had been the only team not to score a Premier League goal from a corner prior to this game but United's weakness from set-pieces was evident again, a tenth goal conceded from a corner. Sulemana might have doubled Saints' lead after that.\nAnd when substitute Antony contrived to miss an open goal, the mood at Old Trafford turned bleak. Amad, as he has so often this season, changed that. As others shrink, he seems to grow under pressure, always wanting it, offering movement on and off the ball.\nIt was enough to salvage the three points against a Southampton side that crumbled like a team that has won only once all season. Amorim can hardly be satisfied with the overall performance. But for the second time inside a week, he could point to the spirit.",
