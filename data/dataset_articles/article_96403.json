  "text": "Two-time Olympic figure skating silver medallist Kagiyama Yuma earned the highest score in the men’s short program Thursday (16 January) at the Torino 2025 World University Winter Games.\nThe Japanese skater managd a season's best of 106.82, ahead of compatriot Sato Shun (96.30) and Italy's Daniel Grassl (93.82).\nKagiyama opened his program, set to The Sound of Silence, with a clean quadruple toe loop, triple toe loop combination. He followed it up with a quadruple Salchow that moved seamlessly into his sit spin.\nHis final jumping pass was a triple Axel, to the delight of coach and Olympic bronze medallist Carolina Kostner, who jumped for joy behind the boards.\nThe 2024-25 season has started strong for Kagiyama, 21, who won both of his Grand Prix assignments and finished runner-up at the Grand Prix Final to world champion Ilia Malinin of the United States.\nHe recently claimed his first-ever Japanese national title, a championship once held by his father. At the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022, Kagiyama won silver medals in both the individual and team events.\nSato, 20, was last to skate Thursday and one of the few with the resume coming into the event to challenge Kagiyama for the top spot, having clinched the Cup of China Grand Prix earlier in the season. He delivered a clean program, jumping a quad toe, triple toe combination to open, followed by a quad Flip and a triple Axel, but came up short.\nIt was a much needed turn-around for Sato who finished a disappointing seventh at the recent Japanese nationals.\nFor 2022 European silver medallist Grassl, it was a season best score powered, in part, by a quadruple Lutz opening jump.\nThe men’s free skate at the World University Winter Games is set for Saturday (18 January).\nA winter wonder in Italy awaits! 🏂❄️🎿 Ticket-inclusive hospitality packages for the Olympic Winter Games in Italy go live on 6th February 2025! 🎫 Don't miss your chance to secure Milano Cortina 2026 tickets to the most sought-after sporting sessions paired with luxury service, accommodation, and more.\nWorld University Winter Games Torino 2025 - men's short program results, top 10\n- Kagiyama Yuma (JPN), 106.82\n- Sato Shun (JPN), 96.30\n- Daniel Grassl (ITA), 93.82\n- Shaidorov Mikhail (KAZ), 91.79\n- Cha Junhwan (KOR), 82.40\n- Yamamoto Sota (JPN), 78.81\n- Lee Sihyeong (KOR), 73.60\n- Corey Circelli (ITA), 70.48\n- Raffaele Francesco Zich (ITA), 69.66\n- Samy Hammi (FRA), 69.30",
