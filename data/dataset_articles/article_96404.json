  "text": "Sports\nAlbany Academy boys’ basketball feasts against La Salle\nTROY - Jack Louridas happily chomped on a cookie Tuesday evening.\nThat's a post-game ritual the Albany Academy junior standout would have found difficult had it been attempted Saturday or Sunday when the Cadets suffered from a team-wide stomach bug that hindered their efforts in a pair of losses.\nLooking for a huge bounce-back performance, Albany Academy authored a master class in how to spread the floor, share the ball, and attack an athletic and highly-skilled contingent from La Salle. Albany Academy shot a sizzling 64.8% from the field, registered 22 assists and committed just five turnovers in producing an 88-53 victory.\n\"We wanted to come back in this game and make a statement,\" said Albany Academy senior guard Ras Elijah Godbolt, who delivered 17 points and eight assists. \"We wanted to prove we are the best around here.\"\nAlbany Academy (12-2), ranked No. 1 in the Class AA state poll, went through a rough week as it first lost junior guard Xavier Lopez to a compound fracture of his ankle. The team then dropped a pair of contests on the road to No. 6 Class AAA ranked Iona Prep (63-50) and No. 1 Class AAA ranked Archbishop Stepinac (73-67).\n\"We lost Xavier Lopez to a horrific injury and we miss 'X.' It was a real emotion thing for us,\" Albany Academy coach Jim Driggs said. \"Then we play Saturday and most of the guys have the stomach bug. We regroup and have a good game against one of the best teams in the country in Stepinac. We were up seven in the fourth quarter. ... We came out of it on the other side rejuvenated. I am happy with the way we executed tonight, especially on offense.\"\n\"We wanted to get back to winning. La Salle is a very good team, but I thought we executed very well,\" said Louridas, who led Albany Academy's five starters, which all scored in double digits, with 25 points on 9-for-12 shooting.\n\"We knew they were a good team and that they were going to make their shots. We tried to do our best,\" La Salle sophomore Davon Maloney said. \"They were coming for a win after those two losses.\"\nLa Salle (6-3) trailed 17-13 after one quarter, but could not keep pace with the visitors in the second quarter when Albany Academy knocked down 10 of 14 shots to extend its lead to 39-23 at halftime. La Salle fared well on the offensive glass, yet made just 3 of 17 shots in the second quarter.\nWhether it was against a 2-3 zone or man-to-man defense, Albany Academy methodically moved the ball around and constantly created quality chances. The visitors ended up making 37 of 54 shots, never dipping below 50% in any quarter. Jamar Macon tallied 14 points, while Cyrus Matia and Elijah Taylor each added 12 points for Albany Academy.\n\"Give credit to the guys. They are buying in to what we're trying to teach on offense,\" Driggs said. \"They played a lot of zone, so we wanted the ball to move with energy. They did a good job with that.\"\n\"No one wants theirs. We all want each others,\" Louridas said. \"Everyone's shot is the right shot.\"\n\"We moved the ball well and played unselfish. That is our game,\" Godbolt said.\nMaloney, who paced La Salle with 23 points in an outing where he produced three dunks, a pair of beautiful reverse layups and two 3-pointers, believes an outing such as Tuesday's will prove beneficial in the team's quest to capture a Section II Class AA title in March.\n\"This game helps us a lot. (Albany Academy) is the best team around here. We're a young team that needs to get better. This shows us our flaws,\" Maloney said. \"You have to give them their props, for sure. They're good.\"\nCopyright (C) 2024, Tribune Content Agency, LLC. Portions copyrighted by the respective providers.\nThis story was originally published January 16, 2025 at 3:49 PM.",
