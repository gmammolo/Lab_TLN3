  "text": "DALLAS — This week, nonprofit pet transport charity Wings of Rescue has been operating relief flights in response to catastrophic flooding across Central Texas.\nThe nonprofit delivers humanitarian and veterinary aid to affected communities and airlifts shelter pets out of crisis zones to safety, where they find adoptive homes.\nKey Relief Efforts\nYesterday, Wings of Rescue evacuated 127 pets from overcrowded shelters in Kerrville and neighboring regions. Some pets are now secure in Fort Worth, Texas, thanks to foster care and a partnership with shelters.\nOthers continued to Best Friends Animal Society in Kanab, Utah, the nation’s largest no-kill animal sanctuary. This work freed up valuable space at local shelters, allowing them to receive animals displaced by the flooding.\nToday, Wings of Rescue airlifts 115 more pets from San Angelo, Texas, with similar destinations and goals.\nImpact, Community Support\nShelter directors emphasized that without these flights, they would have faced the heartbreaking decision to euthanize existing shelter pets to make room for flood victims.\nThe operation is a collaboration between Wings of Rescue, Best Friends Animal Society, the Humane Society of North Texas, SPCA of Texas, and Austin Pets Alive!. These flights are saving lives of pets already in shelters and those newly displaced by disaster.\nVolunteers and donors play a vital role, providing emergency foster homes, supplies, and funding for flights and relief efforts. Ongoing needs include pet food, medical supplies, and additional foster and adoptive homes.\n“Had Wings not flown in, we would’ve had to euthanize the pets already in our care just to make room for flood victims,” Shelter Director, Central Texas.\nHow You Can Help\n- Foster or adopt: Open your home to a rescued pet.\n- Donate:\nSupportorganizations like Wings of Rescue and Best Friends Animal Society. - Volunteer: Assist with local shelter operations or transport logistics.\nWings of Rescue performs an important part in disaster assistance by airlifting pets and delivering humanitarian aid to afflicted communities. Best Friends Animal Society offers sanctuary and adoption options for evacuated pets, providing a safe place for them to recover before finding new homes.\nAs part of its disaster relief operations, the Humane Society of North Texas offers emergency foster care and adoption services to evacuated animals.To help control the influx of animals during disasters, the SPCA of Texas supports shelters and disaster response efforts.\nLastly, Austin Pets Alive! collaborates with other organizations as a rescue and coordination partner to ensure the safe placement and transportation of animals in need. Together, these partners form a collaborative network dedicated to supporting communities in need and saving the lives of these furry family members.",
