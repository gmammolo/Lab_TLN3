  "text": "Dodgers Team News\nDodgers Operating With The Confidence That They’ll Sign Roki Sasaki\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers put all of their international signings on hold for the 2025 class. They’re currently exploring trades in order to get more international bonus pool money.\nThe actions of the organization essentially say it all: The Dodgers are operating with the confidence that they will sign Roki Sasaki.\nDodgers Nation’s Doug McKain provided more insight on the Sasaki sweepstakes in a recent episode of Dodgers Dougout Live.\n“What I’ve heard on Roki Sasaki so far is Yoshinobu Yamamoto is playing an important role in whether the Dodgers land him,” McKain said. “Los Angeles has been operating with the confidence that they will sign Sasaki.”\nMore news: Tyler Glasnow Spoke to Roki Sasaki On the Phone in Attempt to Recruit him to Dodgers\nWhile everyone looks to Shohei Ohtani as the biggest reason for Sasaki to join the reigning World Series champions, McKain pointed toward the importance of Yamamoto, who is a starting pitcher “solely by trade.”\n“Yoshinobu Yamamoto embracing Roki Sasaki is going to have a major impact,” McKain said. “Shohei transitioned to The Show seven years ago, Yamamoto did it last year.”\nWith Yamamoto making the jump to stateside baseball just a year ago, McKain believes Sasaki will have someone to relate to since the process is still relatively fresh for the Dodgers star. Additionally, the two pitchers have the same agent which also adds to the familiarity aspect.\nSasaki has until Jan .23 to sign, when his posting window closes. The Dodgers, San Diego Padres, and Toronto Blue Jays are the three finalists in the Sasaki sweepstakes. But the Dodgers don’t usually take such big risks without being confident about an impending reward.\nThe Dodgers’ recent actions only highlight just how optimistic the organization is about signing Sasaki.\nThe Dodgers can also bulk up the amount they offer Sasaki by making trades in the coming days. The Dodgers have the least amount of money in their international bonus pool out of the three final teams; however, the team can get over $8 million in their bonus pool by orchestrating multiple trades.\nAlthough making trades could increase the amount of money in their bonus pool, it’s uncertain the Dodgers absolutely have to in order to sign Sasaki. It’s evident the 23-year-old isn’t joining MLB for the money, or else he would’ve waited until he was eligible to receive a lucrative contract at 25 years old.\nMore Roki Sasaki News:\nWhen Will Roki Sasaki Sign With Dodgers, Padres, or Blue Jays?
