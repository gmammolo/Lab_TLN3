  "text": "Showing courage and determination, the Philippine national women’s futsal team pulled off a 2-0 victory over Turkmenistan on Wednesday night in the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Women’s Futsal Asian Cup China 2025 Group C qualifiers in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.\nThe performance immediately drew praises from fans and the team’s mother federation.\n“We are very happy of the way the girls are performing. We wish they can continue with this until the end of the tournament,” said Philippine Football Federation secretary general Angelo Mercader. “The girls have shown their competitive spirit, palaban sila.”\nIt was the Philippines’ second win in the tournament, following a 3-0 draw with host Uzbekistan earlier in the qualifiers.\nThe victory also kept the Filipinas at the top of Group C and strengthened their chances of reaching the finals in four months.\nKatrina Guillou opened scoring in the 22nd minute, while Dionesia Tolentin sealed the win with a second goal in the 29th.\nTheir combined efforts propelled the Filipinas closer to earning a slot in the tournament proper, scheduled from May 7 to 18.\nFootball officials said the team has turned around since its revamp last wee, following a disappointing showing during the recent 2024 ASEAN Women’s Futsal Championship.\nThe first goal was a result of a well-orchestrated play. Cathrine Graversen initiated the attack by setting up Judy Connolly, who delivered a precise pass to Guillou.\nGuillou skillfully dribbled past defenders and found the net just outside the box.\nNew coach Rafael Merino, with national women’s football team coach Mark Torcaso assisting him, has kept the Filipinas in fighting shape.\nAs the 30th minute approached, Tolentin capitalized on an error by Turkmenistan’s keeper, Malika Eminova.\nTolentin intercepted a stray pass to Maya Musaskaya and sent the ball into the unguarded net.\nLater Wednesday evening, Uzbekistan defeated Kuwait 5-0 to retain third place and stay in contention with a 1-1-0 record.",
