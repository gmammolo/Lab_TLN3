  "text": "Amad Diallo saved Manchester United blushes with a trio of goals at Old Trafford. We bring you the best facts and Opta data with our Man Utd vs Southampton stats page.\nA late hat-trick from Amad Diallo saw Manchester United beat Southampton 3-1 at Old Trafford to keep the new year momentum going for Ruben Amorim’s side.\nUnited trailed for most of the second half after going behind to a Manuel Ugarte own goal, only for Amad to switch on the style with three late goals.\nIt took Amorim’s men a while to get going, with bottom-of-the-table Southampton the better team for much of the first hour in Manchester, but second-half pressure from United eventually told.\nAndré Onana made an important save from Kamaldeen Sulemana in the 12th minute, before pulling off an impressive double stop from efforts by Tyler Dibling and Mateus Fernandes as Southampton piled the pressure on in the first half.\nUnited were largely second best in the opening 45 minutes, but did have a great chance to take the lead through Alejandro Garnacho, but the Argentine fired wide from Rasmus Højlund’s low cross.\nSouthampton had attempted seven shots by the 35th minute, more than they managed in the entirety of the reverse fixture in September (6), but it didn’t take a shot to give them the lead in the 43rd minute. Fernandes’ corner was flicked on at the near post by Dibling, before the ball hit Ugarte on the back and went in despite Onana’s best efforts to keep it out.\nUnited have conceded 10 goals from corners in the Premier League this season. Not only the joint-most along with Wolves, but just one shy of the club’s most ever in a single season in the competition (11 in 2023-24), despite this being just their 21st league game of the campaign.\nThe home fans couldn’t believe their side weren’t level in the 59th minute as a United break led to Garnacho squaring the ball for Antony, but the sliding substitute somehow diverted the ball into the arms of Aaron Ramsdale at the back post when he had all the goal to aim at.\nJust as it seemed the game would get away from United, a familiar face came to the rescue. In the 82nd minute, Amad picked up the ball on the right before running at goal. His initial shot was blocked by Kyle Walker-Peters, but the ball fell kindly for the young Ivorian who made no mistake to equalise with his second effort, finishing well past Ramsdale.\nHis second came after a give-and-go that led to Christian Eriksen chipping the ball over the top for Amad to volley in, before he robbed Taylor Harwood-Bellis of the ball in the penalty area in stoppage time as the Saints defender gift wrapped the hat-trick.\nAmad has now been directly involved in 10 goals in his last 11 Premier League appearances (5 goals, 5 assists). Only Mohamed Salah (20) and Alexander Isak (17) have more Premier League goal involvements since the start of November than him.\nIt may not have been a convincing performance from Man Utd, but it was a night to remember for their new 22-year-old hero.\nOur Opta match centre delivers you all the Manchester United vs Southampton stats from their Premier League meeting at Old Trafford.\nThe match centre below includes team and player stats, expected goals data, passing networks, an Opta chalkboard and more. It gives you everything you need to do your own match analysis.\nUnderneath the match centre you can find the official Opta stats on the game as well.\nMan Utd vs Southampton: Post-Match Facts\n- Only Wayne Rooney (21y 4d vs Bolton in October 2006) has scored a Premier League hat-trick for Manchester United at a younger age than Amad Diallo tonight (22y 189d), who is now the Red Devils’ youngest ever hat-trick scorer at Old Trafford in the competition.\n- Amad is the third player in Premier League history to score three times in the final 10 minutes of a game after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer vs Nottingham Forest in February 1999 and Rooney vs Hull City in January 2010, with all three instances coming by Man Utd players.\n- Southampton are winless in each of their last 18 Premier League away games (D4 L14), the longest run without victory on the road in the division since Aston Villa in September 2019 (21 games).\nEnjoy this?
