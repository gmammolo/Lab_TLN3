  "text": "ESPN's Dan Orlovsky: James Cook's vision sensational in Bills win vs. Broncos Kam Towle | USA TODAY Sports ESPN NFL analyst Dan Orlovsky is well-regarded for his knowledge of football's intricacies. This week, he joined One Bills Live and praised the Buffalo Bills ' running game against the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card round, particularly James Cook.\nCook carried 23 times for 120 yards and a score in the 31-7 win at Highmark Stadium.\n\"I thought James Cook's vision was sensational,\" Orlovsky said. \"His ability to wait for the hole and then get through the hole... that vision and burst was one of the better performances I've seen all season. It was in many ways, I don't want to say flawless, but a big performance by that whole group.\"\nFor Cook, this just added to his list of standout games on the ground this year. He had four 100+yard games and eight games of 70+ in the regular season.\nHe had a spectacular 2024 regular season as he continued to improve as a runner. He tied O.J. Simpson for the most rushing touchdowns in a season in Bills history (16). He did this despite carrying the ball over 120 fewer times than Simpson in his record-breaking year (1975).\nCook, Josh Allen (46 yards rushing), and Ty Johnson (44 yards rushing) led the way for a ground game that totaled 210 yards in the Wild Card win.\nCheck out the full clip from One Bills Live:\nTweets by danorlovsky7",
