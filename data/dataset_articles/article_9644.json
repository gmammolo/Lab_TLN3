  "text": "INGRAM, Texas — Ingram Fire Department has transitioned from emergency flood response to long-term rebuilding efforts after an overwhelming community response met their immediate disaster relief needs, Chief Diana Baccus announced.\nThe change follows what Baccus described as a “tidal wave of love, support and generosity” from people both locally and from afar. The department’s Amazon wishlist has been updated from emergency response items to essential everyday supplies needed for ongoing operations and community service.\n“Over the past few days, we have been overwhelmed — not just by the floodwaters that shook our community, but by the tidal wave of love, support and generosity that followed,” Baccus wrote in the department’s newsletter.\nDespite the personal and operational challenges caused by the devastating flood, Baccus emphasized the department’s commitment to serving its community.\n“We are not just firefighters. We are sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, friends and neighbors. And this community? It is everything to us,” she said.\nThe department has established official donation channels to help supporters contribute safely. Information about legitimate donation links and the updated Amazon wishlist has been pinned to the top of their social media page, along with warnings about fraudulent accounts trying to exploit the disaster.\n“Unfortunately, there are fraudulent accounts trying to take advantage of your kindness,” Baccus said, urging people to report suspicious activity directly to the department.\nThough it is difficult to ask for help, Baccus expressed gratitude for the community’s response.\n“Though it is never easy for us to ask for help, we have been flooded — this time with kind offers and messages asking how to donate or support our mission,” she wrote.\nBaccus called the flooding “devastating” for both the department and local families but praised the community’s resilience.\n“This event has been devastating, not just to our department, but to our families and neighbors. Still, through the heartbreak, through the exhaustion, and through the tears — we continue to rise together,” she said.\nThe department continues to receive messages from supporters asking how to help during what Baccus called “this unimaginable time.” Those interested in supporting rebuilding efforts can find official donation information pinned to the top of the department’s social media page.",
