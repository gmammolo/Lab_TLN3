  "text": "Ichabod Crane’s boys’ volleyball team is undefeated in the middle of January again, and at the center of it is senior setter Eben Krein.\nAs Ichabod Crane’s sole setter in 2024-25, Krein is averaging just over 33 assists per match, and has felt pretty comfortable with the responsibility he’s been given.\n“Honestly, I was worried there's gonna be a lot of pressure, but I feel like I filled the role pretty good, and I feel like I’m kind of leading this team,” he said. “We’re just trying to keep our heads up and [I’m focused on] putting the ball where it needs to be.”\nWhile this season is the first time Krein is the Riders’ sole setter, with the team running five hitters and one setter as opposed to a 4-2 in 2023-24, he thinks that spending his junior season on the floor for every point was important.\n“It was really helpful,” he said. “Having the year of experience before this, coming into this really helps, easing my way into it.”\nHead coach Sean Connors feels that Krein has stepped up to the level of leadership asked of him this season.\n“The senior setter is going to be basically another coach on the floor, so I give you the tools, it's your offense to run, and he's been doing a nice job,” he said.\nConnors finds that Krein’s style of communication is less verbal than what he’s used to, something he doesn’t mind at all.\n“These guys, if you watch them, they kind of make eye contact, and so I'm very open with them working on the same page, as long as they know how to get there,” he said.\nOne of Krein’s front-row teammates is senior middle Connor McDarby, who feels very well-synced with his setter.\n“We've been playing together for a couple years, and we've been working together to get everything down pat and keep it going,” he said.\nKrein thinks the feeling is mutual.\n“Us being on the same team for the past two years, it just really helped us build a connection,” he said. “He knows where to put the ball, I know where to be, and just being on that same page every practice is just key.”\nWhile Connors thinks that his coach on the floor still has some potential to unlock in his senior year, he believes Krein’s growth across his time at the school has been very rewarding to watch.\n“Compared to when I saw him three or four years ago, I was not sure he'd be where he is today, he's worked very hard,” Connors said. “To see him get emotional and get excited about winning, that motivates me to want to help him get better.”\nIchabod Crane is 8-0 and has only dropped three sets so far, a start which includes a home-away sweep of Catskill after not beating the Cats for three years. Last season saw the Riders start 15-0, with their first defeat coming in February, and Connors is confident there’s more work to be done to make it out of Section 2 for a fifth year in a row.\n“I always tell the guys, ‘You got to win the last game you played,’ and I don't think we're good enough to do that yet,” he said. “We've always got to keep getting better every day coming into the gym, whether it's practice or a game.”\nIchabod Crane visits Section 2’s other remaining undefeated team in Voorheesville on Wednesday.",
