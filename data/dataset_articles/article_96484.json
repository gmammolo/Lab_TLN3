  "text": "Brazilian soccer megastar Neymar Jr could follow his former teammate Lionel Messi to Major League Soccer this summer in a blockbuster move for the league.\nThe forward, who was one of the best in the world at one point and formed a devastating front three with Messi and Luis Suarez (both now at Inter Miami) during their shared time at Barcelona, is currently playing in Saudi Arabia with Al Hilal.\nHowever, despite earning a staggering $107 million per year, he's played just a handful of times in the free-spending Saudi Pro League due to injury.\nWith his contract expiring at the end of the season, Neymar is expected to end his Saudi nightmare, though a return to Europe seems out of the question. Instead, MLS side Chicago Fire appears to have made the first step towards signing him on what would be a free transfer - though the organization faces a hefty payout.\nAccording to GiveMeSport, the Fire owns Neymar's MLS rights as it made first contact with him, giving the organization a major upper hand on its league rivals. If any other team from MLS wants to negotiate with Neymar, they will have to pay a fee to the Fire.\nDespite Neymar being interested in a reunion with Messi and Suarez in south Florida, it's claimed Miami currently has no interest in pursuing a move for the Brazilian. The financial outlay it would take to sign Messi would simply be too much for the team - considering Messi's $20 million per year salary and the MLS salary cap restrictions.\nNeymar would reportedly command a salary and contract similar to the one signed by Messi in 2023 - giving him sponsorship opportunities as well as a hefty salary. While Chicago is prepared to offer him that contract, Neymar's representatives have reportedly asked for more money, which could throw a spanner in the works and scupper the deal.\nIt's also worth noting Saudi officials are still eager to extend Neymar - due to the ambassadorial work he would do in the build-up to the 2034 World Cup, which will be played in Saudi. A return to Santos has also been mooted for the Brazilian.\nThe report suggests the upcoming 2026 World Cup, which will be played across the US, Canada and Mexico, could be a factor in the move, considering the rivalry the deal would create between Chicago and Miami and, by proxy, Messi's Argentina and Neymar's Brazil.\nNeymar hasn't been shy about his desire to reunite with Messi and Suarez at Miami, saying to CNN: \"Playing again with [Lionel] Messi and [Luis] Suarez would be incredible. They are my friends. We still speak to each other. It would be interesting to revive this trio.\"",
