  "text": "OVERLAND PARK, Kan. – The No. 11-ranked Johnson County Community College men's basketball team improved to 2-0 in Kansas Jayhawk Conference Division II play on Wednesday night with a 77-72 victory over cross town rival Kansas City Kansas Community College on the campus of Metropolitan Community College-Penn Valley campus.\nThe game was not as close as the five-point margin would indicate. The Cavaliers took the lead for good with 6:19 to play in the first half led by double digits with just 1:03 left in the game.\nFour JCCC starters finished in double figures led by sophomore guard Steven Samuels with 18. He made 5-of-9 shots including three from beyond the arc and was 5-of-8 at the charity stripe.\nFreshman point guard Gavin Harvey was 5-of-12 shooting with a pair of 3-pointers and hit 4-of-6 free throws to post 16 points, along with a team-high five assists.\nFreshman forward Tavian Cruse flirted with a double-double with 15 points and nine rebounds, and sophomore forward Brandon Mann tallied 12 points, all in the second half, and grabbed six boards.\nJCCC's fifth starter, freshman guard Joey Robinson, also had a solid line with eight points, eight rebounds and four assists.\nThe Blue Devils were led by Cameron Williford with 30 points, 24 coming in the second half. BJ Stewart followed with 15 and 13 rebounds.\nJohnson County (14-3, 2-0) will host Highland Community College (11-6, 1-1) on Saturday afternoon at 4 p.m. The Scotties come into the game on the heels of an 83-62 road loss at Neosho County.",
