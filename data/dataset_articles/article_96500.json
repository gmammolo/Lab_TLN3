  "text": "Elite 2025 Four-Star Center Mouhamed Sylla Announces Commitment to Georgia Tech Over Oregon and Arkansas\nToday was commitment day for four-star 2025 center Mouhamed Sylla. He was choosing between Georgia Tech, Oregon, and Arkansas and he chose to commit to Damon Stoudamire and the Yellow Jackets. He joins four-star guard Akai Fleming, three-star forward Brandon Stores, three-star guard Eric Chatfield, and three-star center Cole Kirouac as members of the 2025 class. This is a massive win for Georgia Tech on the recruiting trail and Sylla is a player who could play right away next season.\nOur own Najeh Wilkins wrote this about Sylla earlier this week:\n\"He plays his high school ball for Bella Vista Prep in Arizona who are currently off to a 9-6 start this season. Sylla is a 6'10 and 240-pound prospect who is great on both ends of the court. When he is slashing to the rim with a full head of speed, he is tough to slow down from making an impact on the rim.\nAccording to 247Sports, Sylla is ranked as the No. 2 player in Arizona, No. 5 center, and No. 29 player nationally. What has been exciting to see is his rise to becoming a ranked player in the country. He was unranked until about four months ago when he rose in the ranking for 247Sports being donned a four-star. 247Sports Recruiting analyst Eric Bossi described him as a violent finisher at the rim and rim protector. Here is more on what he had to say about Sylla.\nWhen you roll the tape, you see a very athletic guy who moves well for his size. Offensively, he is an asset in the pick and roll and projects as a lob threat and a player who can convert on the inside. Defensively, he is a versatile defender capable of guarding multiple positions and is an elite rim protector.\nWhen we look at the Georgia Tech basketball team as currently constructed they struggled with perimeter defense and rim protection this year. A lot of the time teams are able to probe in the lane and get easy shot opportunities. Although nothing is guaranteed on the collegiate level, Sylla could have an impact in this area and be a great rotational defender for the Yellow Jackets\"\nHere is a scouting report on Sylla from On3's Jamie Shaw:\n“Mouhammed Sylla’s best attribute might be that he always seems to be around the ball. Sylla tracks well in and out of his area, both with rebounding and on the defensive end. Defensively, he has some intriguing versatility. Sylla is capable of sliding his feet and turning his hips with perimeter-based forwards. He is also good in the passing lanes and he can protect the rim both on and off the ball. The frame along with the instincts give him an interesting ceiling on defense. Offensively, Sylla shows some nice flashes. He is best when facing the basket and playing toward the rim. He attempts to dunk everything he catches within five feet of the basket. The 6-foot-10 center rolls well toward the rim and he plays out of the dunker areas, providing vertical floor spacing. He also has some face-up skills off the bounce. Ripping through from the high post and getting to the rim on two or three dribbles. He needs to continue developing the jump shot, tightening the skill set, and working on the reads and processing aspect. But the tolls are there. The current production is already in place. The flashes are a little loose, but they provide an intriguing ceiling.”\nRelated Links\nWay Too Early 2026 National Championship Odds: Looking at Where Georgia Tech and the Other ACC Teams Land\nGeorgia Tech Football 2024 Report Card: Quarterback Was A Position Of Strength & Could Be Even Better In 2025\nReport: Georgia Tech Hires Alabama Defensive Assistant For Vacant Cornerbacks Coach Position",
