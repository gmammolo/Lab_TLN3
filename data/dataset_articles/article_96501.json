  "text": "Football News\nPremier League: Amad Diallo proves to be the hero once again for Manchester United\nRuben Amorim has unearthed a real star in Amad Diallo ever since his arrival to the club and the Ivorian winger has proved to be the club's shining light this season and was the hero once again tonight.\nNew Delhi: Manchester United have been a real topsy turvy team this season, especially since the arrival of Ruben Amorim to the club. The Red Devils have managed impressive results like a win over Manchester City, draw to Liverpool, win over Arsenal in the FA Cup but have struggled against lesser opposition. However, there has been one consistent shining light for the club since Amroim’s arrival and that has been the rediscovery of Amad Diallo.\nThe Ivorian winger joined the club in the summer of 2021 but struggled for consistency both in terms of form and game time on the pitch for the club. Since the arrival of Ruben Amorim, Amad Diallo has been a consistent starter for the club and proved his worth once again with a man of the match performance against the Saints. Manchester United were staring in the face of defeat up until the 80th minute as they were down 1-0 at home.\n⚽—82′\n⚽—90′ AMAD.[pic.twitter.com/5Ckr8Cgrje]— B/R Football (@brfootball)[January 16, 2025]\nUp stepped the club’s golden boy, Amad Diallo and produced a fine effort past Aaron Ramsdale to make it 1-1 for the Red Devils, breaking Southampton’s hearts. The game seemed to be headed towards a well deserved draw for both teams but Amad still had something the say. Christian Eriksen found the Ivorian with a perfectly dinked ball in the box and the winger produced a beautiful volley to complete the comeback for his side in the 90th minute to make it 2-1. He still wasn’t done on the night and capitalized on a heavy touch from Taylor Harwood Bellis in his own box to smash the ball into the empty net to grab his first career hattrick and win the game 3-1 for his side. He single handedly dragged Manchester United to victory from the jaws of defeat and had the whole of Old Trafford signing his name during injury time. The boy is certainly special and Ruben Amorim has unearthed a gem for the Red Devils.\nSet piece troubles still haunt Manchester United\nManchester United on set pieces:[pic.twitter.com/tbgDecJUEC]— B/R Football (@brfootball)[January 16, 2025]\nWhile Amad Diallo rescued the club once again, it wasn’t a great performance from the Red Devils with the club struggling for most of the game. They went behind in the first half to a team that had only scored 12 goals in the entire season prior to tonight’s game and had the worst scoring record in the league. In what has become a recurrent theme for the club, they once again went behind to a corner, making this the 10th goal conceded that they conceded from a corner this season.\nIt is the most that a club have conceded in this Premier League season and was the first goal Southampton scored from a corner. The Saints had failed to score from their previous 87 corners before scoring in the 43rd minute of the game. Amorim needs to address his side’s set piece frailties with 10 of the 29 goals they’ve conceded in the league coming from corners, which amounts to 34% of all of their goals conceded.\nClick for more latest Football news.
