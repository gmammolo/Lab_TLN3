  "text": "Manchester United 3-1 Southampton: Player Ratings as Amad Diallo Hat Trick Saves Red Devils\nManchester United defeated Southampton 3-1 in the Premier League thanks to a second half hat trick from Amad Diallo.\nDiallo continues to perform like United's player of the season once again rescuing a side that should've easily dismissed the last place team in the league. Southampton took the lead in the first half through an unlucky own goal by Manuel Ugarte. United had opportunities to get things back level in the second half, but Southampton continued to survive through last ditch defending.\nThat is, until Diallo decided to take things into his own hands. An equalizer in the 82nd minute, followed by two goals in rapid succession in stoppage time secured the player's first-ever hat trick and the title of savior on the night.\nWhat once looked another evening of disappointment and frustration ended with Diallo's name being sang by Old Trafford. A moment the 22-year-old will never forget as he continues to prove he's a player for the present and future.\nPlayer ratings from the night below.\nJOIN SI SOCCER'S MANCHESTER UNITED WHATSAPP COMMUNITY - GET ALL THE LATEST NEWS AND ANALYSIS STRAIGHT TO YOUR PHONE\nManchester United Player Ratings vs. Southampton (3-4-2-1)\nRatings Provided by Fotmob\nPlayer | Rating |\n---|---|\nGK: Andre Onana | 7.8/10 |\nCB: Lisandro Martínez | 6.8/10 |\nCB: Leny Yoro | 7.0/10 |\nCB: Matthijs de Ligt | 7.7/10 |\nLWB: Noussair Mazraoui | 8.0/10 |\nCM: Kobbie Mainoo | 6.0/10 |\nCM: Manuel Ugarte | 6.1/10 |\nRWB: Amad Diallo | 9.7/10 |\nAM: Bruno Fernandes (C) | 7.5/10 |\nAM: Alejandro Garnacho | 7.8/10 |\nST: Rasmus Højlund | 6.2/10 |\nSUB: Antony (46' for Mainoo) | 6.7/10 |\nSUB: Joshua Zirkzee (53' for Højlund) | 6.5/10 |\nSUB: Toby Collyer (54' for Ugarte) | 6.5/10 |\nSUB: Christian Eriksen (83' for Mazraoui) | N/A |\nSUB: Harry Maguire (83' for Yoro) | N/A |\nSouthampton Player Ratings vs. Manchester United (3-4-2-1)\nRatings Provided by Fotmob\nPlayer | Rating |\n---|---|\nGK: Aaron Ramsdale | 5.7/10 |\nCB: Taylor Harwood-Bellis | 6.1/10 |\nCB: Jan Bednarek | 6.9/10 |\nCB: James Bree | 6.4/10 |\nLWB: Kyle Walker-Peters | 6.7/10 |\nCM: Joe Aribo | 7.4/10 |\nCM: Lesley Ugochukwu | 7.0/10 |\nRWB: Yukinari Sugawara | 6.4/10 |\nAM: Kamaldeen Sulemana | 6.3/10 |\nAM: Tyler Dibling | 6.5/10 |\nST: Mateus Fernandes | 7.5/10 |\nSUB: William Smallbone (63' for Dibling) | 5.9/10 |\nSUB: Flynn Downes (73' for Aribo) | 6.2/10 |\nSUB: Adam Armstrong 73' for Fernandes) | 5.9/10 |\nSUB: Nathan Wood (84' for Bednarek) | N/A |\nSUB: Paul Onuachu (84' for Ugochukwu) | N/A |",
