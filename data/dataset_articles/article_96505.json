  "text": "What Detroit Tigers like about top international signee Cris Rodriguez, three others Evan Petzold Detroit Free Press Show Caption\nHide Caption\nDetroit Tigers talk about Cris Rodriguez in 2025 international class Detroit Tigers executives Miguel Garcia and Rob Metzler talk to reporters January 15, 2025, about signing top international prospect Cris Rodriguez. Detroit Tigers president of baseball operations Scott Harris traveled to the Dominican Republic. The purpose of his visit was twofold: to welcome the team's newest international players and to show support for the team's international scouts.\nDuring the trip, Harris shook hands with Cris Rodriguez .\nHarris thinks Rodriguez rakes.\nLatin American scouting director Miguel Garcia agrees.\n\"Definitely he's got the ability to hit for average, and he's going to develop legit power down the road,\" said Garcia, who led the scouting efforts when the Florida Marlins signed Miguel Cabrera in 1999 and has worked for the Tigers since 2005. \"His frame, his body and the projection that he has leads us to believe that definitely he's going to hit for power.\"\nELITE RAW POWER: Tigers sign international prospect Cris Rodriguez to franchise-record $3.2 million bonus\nThe Tigers signed Rodriguez — a 16-year-old right-handed hitting outfielder from the Dominican Republic — for a franchise-record $3.2 million bonus ($3,197,500, to be exact) when the 2025 international signing period began Wednesday morning. The teenager put pen to paper in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.\nRodriguez, who turns 17 on Jan. 28, is ranked No. 4 by Baseball America , No. 4 by MLB Pipeline and No. 9 by FanGraphs among all prospects in the 2025 international class, which is led by Japanese phenom Roki Sasaki .\nHe will spend the 2025 season in the Dominican Summer League.\n\"The physical ability we believe to be special,\" said assistant general manager Rob Metzler , the second-highest-ranking executive in attendance when Rodriguez signed with the Tigers. \"We love the bat speed, the power, the bat path. We love the athleticism, the frame, the natural projection.\n\"I'd follow that up by saying we feel strongly about the kid. Work ethic, character, aptitude we believe to be pluses. That's what he's shown us over a significant amount of time. We're excited to be able to sign him.\"\nDECISION TIME: Tigers didn't meet with Japanese ace Roki Sasaki — but credit new regime for trying\nThe Tigers have been scouting Rodriguez for at least the past two years.\nArea scout Rodolfo Peñalo , who lives full time in the Dominican Republic, identified Rodriguez, built a relationship with Rodriguez's family and helped the Tigers sign Rodriguez. He received support along the way from scouting supervisor Oliver Arias and crosschecker Pablo Arias .\nThe trio of scouts received support from Garcia and international operations director Tom Moore .\n\"Rodolfo Peñalo did a tremendous job following his development,\" Garcia said, \"and we were able to evaluate him on a consistent basis. Every time we came to the country, we were able to see him in games and see how he was progressing.\"\nMetzler — the assistant general manager who oversees the domestic and international scouting efforts — discussed the process of signing Rodriguez, which involved almost every department in the Tigers' organization.\nIt didn't used to be that way.\n\"How do you build relationships? It takes time,\" Metzler said. \"Up and down the scouting staff and then, more recently, connectivity, more access to different parts of the organization, as we've been able to do that, has been very beneficial to build this relationship.\"\nCris Rodriguez takes batting practice today, signs with the #Tigers tomorrow.\nThe outfielder from the Dominican Republic, who turns 17 on Jan. 28, ranks as the No. 4 international prospect in the 2025 class, according to @MLBPipeline and @BaseballAmerica . pic.twitter.com/NSOqQU2BCe\n— Evan Petzold (@EvanPetzold) January 14, 2025 To clarify, Metzler was referring to significant changes in how the Tigers function on a day-to-day basis since Harris took control of baseball operations in September 2022 (replacing fired general manager Al Avila ). After that, Harris hired Metzler to oversee amateur scouting in October 2022 .\nA DEEP DIVE: Can Tigers improve results with prospects signed from international market?\nThe changes to the process have allowed the Tigers to gain a better understanding about what every individual player plan will look like from all perspectives, such as skill development, strength and conditioning, performance science, nutrition and medical, among other things.\nThe Tigers are more connected than ever before.\n\"This was a full departmental and full organizational effort for something like this to come together,\" Metzler said. \"I thought this department and the staff worked tremendously well together.\"\nAll of the changes started in the front office.\nThat's why it was important when Harris showed face Wednesday in the Dominican Republic, not only to welcome Rodriguez and other international signees but also to spend time with the international scouts.\n\"There should be a lot of handshakes and pats on the back for all of the effort that went into something like this,\" Metzler said. \"I would also highlight that we believe in Cris' ability, but this is one step along a hard and challenging journey.\"\nJose Ramirez, Carlos Benavides, Anderson Diaz For Rodriguez, the Tigers spent 42% of their $7.6 million bonus pool ($7,555,500, to be exact) for the entire 2025 international signing period, from Jan. 15 to Dec. 15.\n[ MUST LISTEN: Make \"Days of Roar\" your go-to Detroit Tigers podcast, available anywhere you listen to podcasts ( Apple , Spotify ) ]\nThe Tigers also signed two other players on Baseball America's top-100 list for international prospects in the 2025 class : Venezuelan center fielder Jose Ramirez (No. 54) and Venezuelan catcher Carlos Benavides (No. 62).\nRamirez, 16, signed for $900,000; Benavides, 17, signed for $800,000.\nHere's what Garcia said about Ramirez, a right-handed hitting center fielder: \"He has some catching experience in the past. We're signing him as a center fielder. He's a plus runner. He's going to have a plus arm down the road. He is definitely a guy that will develop some gap-to-gap power. He has an ability to hit for average. He's an athlete. The way that he moves around makes us believe that he's going to be able to play center field in Comerica Park.\"\nHere's what Garcia said about Benavides, a right-handed hitting catcher: \"He is a kid from Venezuela, but he has been developing here in the Dominican Republic for the last two years. Good defensive tools, and his bat is his calling card. His baseball IQ is pretty advanced for his age. He's definitely a kid that will give you everything he has in order to play the game in the right way.\"\nThe top three prospects — Rodriguez ($3.2 million), Ramirez ($900,000) and Benavides ($800,000) — cost a combined $4.9 million, using up nearly 65% of the bonus pool.\nAnother notable addition: The Tigers signed Venezuelan left-hander Anderson Diaz , who has been training at the academy operated by agent Felix Olivo that produced MLB lefties Martín Pérez and José Castillo .\nDiaz, 17, signed for $450,000.\nHis fastball averages 94 mph.\nHere's what Garcia said about Diaz, a left-handed pitcher: \"We followed him for like a year. We saw his development. When we first saw him, he was like 5 feet 9. Now this kid is 6-3 with a really interested type of body to develop and handle the workload for a young arm. We're excited. He's got close to an average fastball right now, and he's got a really good feel for pitching.\"\nContact Evan Petzold at epetzold@freepress.com or follow him @EvanPetzold .\nListen to our weekly Tigers show \"Days of Roar\" every Monday afternoon on demand at freep.com, Apple Podcasts , Spotify or wherever you listen to podcasts.
