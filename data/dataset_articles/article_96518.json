  "text": "UNC Basketball moves up again in NET rankings after decisive Quad-3 victory over Cal Posted Jan 16, 2025 Quad 3 games won't help your NCAA tournament resume much unless you win handily, but that’s what North Carolina did Wednesday. The Tar Heels’ 79-53 win over Cal moved them up three notches to 34th in the NET rankings, five spots higher than after Saturday’s win at N.C. State. UNC faces a similar scenario Saturday when they host Stanford. (Tar Heel Tribune)",
