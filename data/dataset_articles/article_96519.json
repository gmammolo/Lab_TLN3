  "text": "By ActionNewsJax.com News Staff ,\n1 hours ago The DONNA Marathon Weekend is back for its 18th year this month, running from January 31st through February 2nd.\nThousands of runners from all 50 states are expected to flock to Downtown Jacksonville and the beaches for the various events, including a 5K, DONNA Dash, Half Marathon, Marathon, Ultramarathon, Event Challenges, and the free Health & Wellness Expo.\n>>> STREAM ACTION NEWS JAX LIVE <<< [DOWNLOAD: Free Action News Jax app for alerts as news breaks ]\nThe theme of this year’s race is Destination: Fearless , which the Donna Foundation describes as ‘a celebration of love over fear, representing the idea that every step we take together, every mile we complete, is a step toward embracing a life of hope –– a life that is fearless.\nThe marathon will begin that Sunday at the Jacksonville Beach Seawalk Pavilion. Runners will complete a double-loop course through Jacksonville, Neptune, and Atlantic Beaches before returning to the pavilion.\nThis year, the marathon introduces a new tradition: the Pete’s Bar DONNA Crawl. Participants will veer off from the marathoners to complete a two-mile course, ending at Pete’s Bar in Neptune Beach.\nFor prices and race registration, click here.\nRegistration will remain open now through Saturday, February 1st at 1 p.m.\nRead: Landlords, who own 22 properties in Jacksonville, targeted in DOJ Lawsuit alleging price fixing\nThe DONNA foundation was created by Jacksonville Mayor Donna Deegan.\n“The old saying goes, ‘life is ten percent what happens to you, and 90 percent how you react to it.’ As a three time survivor, that has never seemed more true to me,” said Deegan. “This race is all about reacting to life’s challenges with love over fear. I’m so grateful for the hope and joy and deep sense of accomplishment this event brings to so many, and the confidence it infuses into those who cross the finish line.”\nAccording to foundation officials, funds from the DONNA Marathon Weekend have supported its service to more than 20,647 families living with breast cancer, disbursed $3.3 million toward groundbreaking breast cancer research, and provided more than $6.5 million in financial relief to those in need.\nRead: Half-Staff or Full-Staff?
