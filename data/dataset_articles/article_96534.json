Charlotte Fuller, mother of former jump jockey Page, is also involved and said: “The racecourses have been brilliantly supportive, offering tickets and boxes.”\nFollowing the closure of the forum, Phillips was seeking another suitable platform to host the hunter-chase sponsorship and a relationship with Ben Atkins of the Pointing Pointers podcast was formed.\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic Atkins was asked to host the live stream at his local point-to-point and following that the Pointing Pointers podcast took off. Pointing Pointers were able to promote Phillips’ ideas through their podcast and eventually the Pointing Pointers forum was launched and many people followed the move.\nFellow podcaster Nick Luck, a pointing enthusiast himself, was keen to become involved and has put up a £5,000 bonus to any horse who has ran in a point-to-point during the current season and that can win the races staged at Catterick on March 5 and Kempton on April 1. These races will be titled ‘The Nick Luck Daily Podcast Pointing Pointers Hunter Chase’.\nLuck said: “I have a point-to-point background, Tweseldown was a favourite course to visit, my parents were involved and my brother trains the odd one or two. I hope this initiative is the start of something bigger and better, I'm very keen to support the amateur sector of our sport. This has the potential to provide a healthier and more successful link to jumps racing”.\nWeekend preview\nSouthfield Theatre, a once useful rules performer when trained by Paul Nicholls, recently celebrated his 17th birthday and will be bidding to gain his 30th career victory under his regular partner Lily Bradstock at Larkhill, Wiltshire on Saturday in the members race.\nBradstock, daughter of trainer Sara, will be hopeful he can yet again prove that age is no barrier. She says: “He is a legend, he is a total lunatic at home, he goes flat-out everywhere and being a racehorse is his job. He will only run a couple of times this season.”\nAcey Milan, trained and owned by jumps trainer Anthony Honeyball, is the pick in the novice riders race. Honeyball said: “It's brilliant to have these old horses for the lads in the yard to ride. Chad Bament won three point-to-point races on him and now Will Higgs takes over. It's important to encourage the lads that want to race-ride and it gives them a less-pressured stage at a point-to-point. It also encourages them to work hard within the team at home.”\nCourse specialist Grace A Vous Enki will be bidding to win his eighth race at Larkhill in the men's open. My Drogo, now trained by Devon's Ed Walker, ran a promising third here in December. Others to note are Duc De Bourbon who won here at the last meeting and Oscars Moonshine from the Olive Nicholls yard.\nAt Friars Haugh in Scotland connections of Dusart, who ran in high profile races such as the Cotswold Chase and the Scottish Grand National when trained by Nicky Henderson, will be hoping he can make amends for unseating at Alnwick in December in the mixed open race.\nMusic Drive, trained by Kelly Morgan in Leicestershire is an eyecatching entry and a likely runner in the mixed-open race at Revesby Park.\nPreviously trained in Ireland by Gordon Elliott, the eight-year-old hasn’t run since December 2022 and Morgan said: “The weather has been frustrating and we have had a stop-start prep, but I hope he can do himself justice.”\nSaturday\nLarkhill, Wiltshire, SP4 8QR. First race 11.30. 7 races. 90 entries.\nRevesby Park, Lincolnshire, PE22 7NB. 12.00. 6 races. 71 entries.\nSunday\nFriars Haugh, Borders, TD5 8LT. 12.30. 7 races. 90 entries.\nRead these next:\nRacegoers in for a treat as Chaddesley Corbett and Horseheath set to feature top-class runners\nHow Stratford’s boss is also a ubiquitous figure in the world of point-to-point\nGina Andrews the latest in a long line of wonderful female champions - even if it was a slow path to acceptance\nMy journey didn't quite match Bryony Frost's rise - but how does someone with no racing connections make it in point-to-point?\n'He was the perfect schoolmaster' - Daisy White rides and trains her first winner as record crowds flock to Knightwick\nLooking for free bets?
