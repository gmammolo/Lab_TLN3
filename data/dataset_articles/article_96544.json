  "text": "NEWARK, N.J. - Maine men's basketball won their third straight game after outscoring NJIT 34-18 in the second half, powering the Black Bears to a 57-44 victory in Newark.\nMaine found themselves on the wrong end of a 13-2 run in the first half, and they trailed the Highlanders 21-14 with under four minutes to play in the first half. They closed the gap, trailing by just three at the break, and used ten straight points out of halftime to build a 33-26 lead.\nAJ Lopez led all scorers with 18 points. Kellen Tynes added 12 points to go along with 8 assists and four steals.\nFrom there, the Black Bears never trailed again, and rallied to a 57-44 victory. Maine now sits at 3-1 in America East play, and they look forward to a trip to UMBC on Saturday at 1 p.m.\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Tyler Krusz Sports Director\nAuthor email Follow Tyler Krusz Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!
