Young Arena is a unique wedding venue, and any couple interested in tying the knot that night will have thousands of well-wishers ready to cheer them on during a postgame ceremony at center ice. The Hawks are also well-prepared to host a reception, right on site.\n\"You bring the love; we'll take care of the other details,\" said Black Hawks President and COO Joe Greene. \"We look forward to rolling out the red carpet for brides and grooms, but not the Des Moines Buccaneers.\"\nLove on Ice Night isn't just for newlyweds, either.

Each participating couple will receive an assortment of \"Congratulations\" gifts from the Black Hawks and team partners, valued at $250 or more. Tickets are free for brides and grooms; a special discount code and free drink will be provided to all friends and family they would like to invite. The Hawks will even take care of customized invitations, professionally printed by Karen's Print Rite.\nFollowing the ceremony, the celebration continues. Happy couples and their guests will join us in the Coors Light Cold Zone for cake, photos, drinks, and a postgame dance.\nDon't get cold feet...sign up now for Love on Ice Night.
