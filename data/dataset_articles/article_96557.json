Featured Local Savings \"The D-corps has been fantastic this year and I've been blessed to have that my entire three years playing here,\" he said. \"We got some really skilled guys on the blue line, and to see our freshmen and sophomore defensemen especially, to be playing the way that they are with as few games as we've played has been extremely impressive, and it helps me to be a lot more calm out there.\"\nBlessing began 2025 with a bang, earning his third shoutout of the season in a 3-0 win against conference-leading Sacred Heart on Jan. 4. This past weekend, he allowed just two goals on 65 shots against Bentley, Atlantic Hockey's second-best team.\nHe said the wins against the league's best have been huge for the Falcons' confidence.\n\"Air Force has always been a second-half team and any chance we get to build momentum is enormous,\" Blessing said. \"Especially, to come out of these weekends with a Saturday win and then treating that like a playoff series, we'd be going into Game 3 with that momentum is enormous. So any chance we to generate that among the boys is massive and it's just really cool to see.\"\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Hugh Johnson Author email Follow Hugh Johnson Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!
