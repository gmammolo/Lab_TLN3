  "text": "ROCKAWAY BEACH, Queens (PIX11) — The FDNY is warning individuals to only swim in areas where lifeguards are actively on duty after a rescue was conducted at Rockaway Beach on the Fourth of July. FDNY EMTs responded to a distressed swimmer at around 6:45 p.m. who was swimming when the lifeguards were no longer on duty, officials say. FDNY EMTs Nigro and Soto observed the swimmer struggling to return to shore. The swimmer’s family was on the shore, distressed and waving for help. EMY Nigro swam out to the teen with a personal flotation device and brought him safely back to shore. The swimmer was assessed and reunited with his family.
