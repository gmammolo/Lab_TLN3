  "text": "World champion Luke Littler survived a mid-match scare to advance to the quarter-finals of the Bahrain Darts Masters with a 6-3 victory over Philippine challenger Lourence Ilagan.\nThe opening round saw the eight PDC superstars take on the eight Asian representatives for a place in Friday’s final rounds.\nLittler, in his first tournament since claiming his first world title earlier this month, quickly went up 4-1 but allowed his opponent to halve the deficit then secure a seventh-leg break.\nThe 17-year-old – who was breaking in a new set of arrows – regrouped with a 180 in the next leg and was one leg away from victory after a 142 checkout.\nLittler averaged 94.36, adding another 180 en route to wrapping up the win, and will face world number nine Gerwyn Price in Friday’s last eight.\nThe evening opened with a major upset after former world champion Rob Cross was defeated 6-3 by Paolo Nebrida, who became the first Filipino to win on the World Series.\nNebrida came out on top of a 29-dart fourth leg, while Cross was undone by poor finishing.\nWorld number one Luke Humphries shut out the host nation’s Abdulla Saeed, hitting six out of six on the doubles in a dominant display.\nHe will face Nathan Aspinall in the last eight, after ‘the Asp’ beat China’s Zong Xiao Chen 6-2.\nPrice secured a 6-3 victory over Lok-Yin Lee of Hong Kong with five 180s, while world number five Stephen Bunting – making his Bahrain debut – nailed a 145 opening-leg checkout in his 6-2 victory over India’s Nitin Kumar.\nChris Dobey, coming off his best run at the PDC World Championship – where he made the semi-finals – rarely looked challenged as he cruised through with a 6-0 victory over the host nation’s Bassim Mahmood.\nDobey will take on Bunting in the quarter-finals, where Peter Wright will play Nebrida after beating the Filipino’s compatriot Alexis Toylo 6-3.\nSubscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie\nBuy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.\nKeep up with the latest news from Donegal with our daily newsletter featuring the most important stories of the day delivered to your inbox every evening at 5pm.",
