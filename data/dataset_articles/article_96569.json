  "text": "Turki Alalshikh is continuing to make big moves in the boxing space.\nAlalshikh announced Thursday morning on Twitter that Garcia has signed a contract for his next matchup — although an opponent has yet to be announced, the card is expected to take place some time in May in the U.S.\nAdditionally, Ring Magazine , which Alalshikh owns, reports that Garcia’s recent opponent Devin Haney is expected to compete on the same fight card. The report states that if both men are victorious in their bouts, the plan would be to set an October rematch between Garcia and Haney to kickoff Riyadh Season.\nIn their first meeting this past April, Garcia pulled off a shocking upset, knocking Haney down multiple times en route to a decision win. The victory would be short-lived, however, as the decision would be overturned to a No Contest after Garcia failed a drug test, and was subsequently suspended for a year .\nGarcia was slated to face Rukiya Anpo in an exhibition bout at RIZIN’s New Year’s Eve card this past month, but a wrist injury postponed the contest . Garcia guaranteed the fight would happen in 2025, but it appears his schedule is filling up fast.\n🥷🥊🥋 😍 USE the BET9JA Promotion Code YOHAIG for a ₦100,000 Bonus!",
