  "text": "I don’t know how Red Bull thinks up its Formula 1 stunts. It announced the Miami Grand Prix with Checo Pérez’s car towing a water skier through the Everglades. And it once airlifted a car to a helicopter pad atop a Dubai skyscraper to do donuts. But Red Bull may have outdone itself when it challenged a rugby scrum to a pushing match. Of all the Red Bull stunts, this one went down in history because the eight Rugby players won.\nThe video is a nail biter. The main portion begins with a Red Bull F1 car doing some burnouts on the pavement to warm up its tires. The driver pulls up to the front of a training pad frame. Then come the rugby players.\nEight guys lock arms and put their shoulder against the practice pads. It’s a formation my British friends tell me is called a scrum. And it is how rugby players lock in and work together to push other teams around. Americans: you can think of it as slow-motion football.\nFinally, things get crazy. The 2016 F1 car hits it at full throttle, its 1,000 horsepower powertrain creating a legendary smoke show. Meanwhile, the rugby players punch their cleats into the grass and drive forward. And they push the race car backwards.\nWait, what? That sounds impossible. Red Bull claims the 2016 Red Bull F1 car in the video produces 1,000 BHP/tonne. Its tires are 18-inches wide. How could eight guys possibly push it around? Could they be producing more power?\nHow much horsepower does a Rugby scrum make? A bicyclist on a dyno can put out about 1.3 horsepower. But what the doubled-over rugby players were doing had more in common with a weightlifter’s squat. So how much horsepower did they make?\nA recent study found that a human doing a back squat peaks at about 1.48 horsepower. But let’s be even more generous with our calculations: an olympic weightlifter hoisting a barbell overhead during the “snatch” peaks at 4.66 horsepower.\nIt’s not a perfect analogue, because the snatch relies on momentum. But again, we’re being generous here. Eight olympic-level weightlifters doing the snatch simultaneously would generate 37.28 horsepower.\nThat’s the absolute peak human output. And it’s still a fraction of the F1 car’s output. If you look at the video closely, you see that only the F1’s rear wheels are spinning. So the 200 horsepower electric motor powering the front wheels is not spinning. But that still leaves the 8,000 horsepower internal combustion engine driving the rear wheels. So how could it possibly lose?\nThe answer here is traction. The Red Bull F1 car uses aerodynamics to produce over 2,000 pounds of downforce at high speeds. But sitting still, the 1,700 lbs race car isn’t nearly heavy enough to put all its power down. And for this stunt, the car started with its wheels already spinning. So even on the paved surface it had a major disadvantage.\nThe rugby team, on the other hand, is on its home turf. Literally. The players are on a grass pitch and you can see them dig their cleats into the ground while pushing.\nHonestly, if you put some under-inflated drag racing tires on the same car–rubber engineered for launching from a standstill–it could have mowed over the rugby scrum. But that wouldn’t be very “sporting,” would it? Maybe we’ll see the Detroit Lions’ defensive line take on Ford’s latest NASCAR Mustang next. But in the meantime, you can watch the Red Bull rugby stunt in the video embedded below:\nRelated Is 2022 Ford Maverick Cheating off the Honda Ridgeline?",
