  "text": "JULY 10, 2025 — The Coast Guard Foundation is a non-profit organization committed to strengthening the Coast Guard community and service by supporting members and families all across the country. In the aftermath of the devastating flooding across central Texas, supporters are stepping up in recognition of the heroic, lifesaving work of Coast Guard crews from Texas and beyond.\nSince Friday, Coast Guard teams have been working tirelessly with state and local partners to rescue survivors stranded by rising floodwaters. As rescue efforts continue, the Foundation remains committed to standing with those who serve.\nThe crew of a Coast Guard MH-65E Dolphin helicopter from Air Station Corpus Christi braved what rescue swimmer Scott Ruskan described as “some of the worst flying conditions we’ve been in.” Despite the dangerous weather, they deployed Ruskan to the ground, where he triaged survivors and coordinated helicopter rescues with multiple agencies. His efforts helped evacuate more than 200 people to higher levels of care.\nThe heroic response to the Texas flooding emergency has inspired nationwide support for Coast Guard personnel and their families.\n“Our hearts are with those who lost loved ones in this heartbreaking tragedy,” said Susan Ludwig, Coast Guard Foundation president. “We grieve with you and hold you in our thoughts and prayers.
