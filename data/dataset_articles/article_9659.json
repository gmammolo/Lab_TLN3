  "text": "RUIDOSO — Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said President Donald Trump is expected to a sign a natural disaster declaration Thursday, as Ruidoso officials estimate between 200 and 400 homes and 100 families have been rocked and substantially impacted by the deadly flash flooding that slammed the area Tuesday, killing three people.\n\"This community should expect in the next day and days and weeks tens of millions of dollars — over the coming months, $100 million or more,\" Lujan Grisham said during a news conference in the village Thursday. She added she expects $15 million to be available soon for recovery efforts.\nDevastating flooding swept through neighborhoods near the Rio Ruidoso, which rose in a matter of roughly 20 minutes to a record 20 feet, five times higher than the previous record in an area with burn scars that can make rainfall dangerous.",
