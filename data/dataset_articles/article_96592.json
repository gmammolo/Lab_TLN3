  "text": "Watergrasshill joined an exclusive set of Cork clubs after an amazing All-Ireland intermediate final at Croke Park on Sunday.\nThey're the fourth Cork team to lift that particular trophy, after Kanturk, Ballymartle and Blarney. There have been five senior winners, Newtown, the last in 2004, Midleton, Blackrock, St Finbarr's the Glen, with Sars hoping to join that pantheon next weekend.\nAt junior level, there have been six victorious clubs: Ballygiblin, Mayfield, Meelin, Dripsey, Fr O'Neills and Ballinhassig. Russell Rovers couldn't have any complaints about failing to be added to the roll of honour, with Freshford undoubtedly the better side in the decider two days ago.\nIt was a cruel loss though, their second since 2020, and like Charleville, beaten at junior level in 2012 and intermediate in 2019, they've twice suffered All-Ireland final day pain.\nCastlelyons, St Catherine's and Ballinhassig, who were junior champions in 2003 but not at Croker and then lost the intermediate final in '06, also know what it's like to leave Jones Road without silverware.\nAs Anthony Daly wrote in Monday's Irish Examiner: \"All-Ireland finals are rare and wonderful. And that’s why people – not just the players - glow when they win them.\"\nWe can see Watergrasshill all the way from the Echo office in Blackpool this week, they're shining so brightly! It's been well documented in recent months but they really went on the most unlikely of journeys from outsiders to county champions.\nIt's not that the Hill didn't have talented hurlers, Daire O'Leary, Sean Desmond and Kevin O'Neill especially, it's just they'd failed to get out of their group in recent seasons and flirted with relegation from PIHC. U20 All-Ireland winner Shane Óg O'Regan (they still have Shane O'Regan, who had an impressive All-Ireland final) moved to Sars in 2022 in controversial circumstances, which was a major off-field distraction.\nWhen they trailed Carrigaline by 10 points midway through their opening group game last August, it looked like the same old sceál.\nBut a magnificent comeback, with Adam Murphy landing 0-11, six from play, and Desmond and Brendan Lehane burying goals, ignited their campaign.\nHis match-winning goal deep into injury time on Sunday was his eighth of the season, including a couple for Imokilly, and maybe it was the young captain's destiny.\nIn the build-up, Desmond said: “It's something I suppose you think of when you're a child or when you're out on the grass playing with your friends that, oh, I'm in Croke Park, and I'm getting the winning score or whatever...\"\nAs prophetic as it gets!\nStill, they could never have expected the 2024 season to roll into 2025 and take them up the road to Croke Park. The shortest and sweetest winter ever.\nNewtownshandrum (2004);\nMidleton (1988);\nBlackrock (1979, 1974, 1972);\nSt Finbarr's (1978, 1975);\nGlen Rovers (1977, 1973).\nNewtownshandrum (2006);\nSt Finbarr's (1981);\nBlackrock (1976).\nWatergrasshill (2025);\nKanturk (2018);\nBallymartle (2011);\nBlarney (2009).\nBallinhassig (2006);\nCharleville (2019);\nFr O'Neills (2020);\nCastlelyons (2024).\nBallygiblin (2023);\nMayfield (2017);\nMeelin (2011);\nDripsey (2009);\nFr O'Neills (2006);\nBallinhassig (2003).\nRussell Rovers (2025);\nSt Catherine's (2024);\nBallygiblin (2022);\nRussell Rovers (2020);\nCharleville (2012).",
