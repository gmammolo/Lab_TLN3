  "text": "World champion Luke Littler survived a mid-match scare to advance to the quarter-finals of the Bahrain Darts Masters with a 6-3 victory over Philippine challenger Lourence Ilagan.\nThe opening round saw the eight PDC superstars take on the eight Asian representatives for a place in Friday's final rounds.\nLittler, in his first tournament since claiming his first world title earlier this month, quickly went up 4-1 but allowed his opponent to halve the deficit then secure a seventh-leg break.\nThe 17-year-old – who was breaking in a new set of arrows – regrouped with a 180 in the next leg and was one leg away from victory after a 142 checkout.\nLittler averaged 94.36, adding another 180 en route to wrapping up the win, and will face world number nine Gerwyn Price in Friday’s last eight.\nThe evening opened with a major upset after former world champion Rob Cross was defeated 6-3 by Paolo Nebrida, who became the first Filipino to win on the World Series.\nNebrida came out on top of a 29-dart fourth leg, while Cross was undone by poor finishing.\nWorld number one Luke Humphries shut out the host nation’s Abdulla Saeed, hitting six out of six on the doubles in a dominant display.\nHe will face Nathan Aspinall in the last eight, after 'the Asp’ beat China’s Zong Xiao Chen 6-2.\nChris Dobey, coming off his best run at the PDC World Championship – where he made the semi-finals – rarely looked challenged as he cruised through with a 6-0 victory over the host nation’s Bassim Mahmood.\nDobey will take on Bunting in the quarter-finals, where Peter Wright will play Nebrida after beating the Filipino’s compatriot Alexis Toylo 6-3.",
