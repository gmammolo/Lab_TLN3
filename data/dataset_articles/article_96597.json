  "text": "Sarsfields manager Johnny Crowley expects to have a full squad to choose from for Sunday’s AIB All-Ireland Club SHC final.\nThe Riverstown club take on Dublin’s Na Fianna at Croke Park (1.30pm) as they seek to become the first Cork side since 2004 to lift the Tommy Moore Cup. Since losing the Co-op SuperStores Premier SHC final to Imokilly in October, Sars have beaten Feakle, Ballygunner and Slaughtneil and Crowley is optimistic that all of the panel will be available for selection. While there are a couple of niggles since last Friday’s challenge match against Tipperary, there are no major issues.\n“I think we’re okay,” he said, “we played a game on Friday night and Cathal McCarthy went over on his ankle, but he should be okay.\n“Aaron [Myers] got a few stitches, but that is all part and parcel of it.”\nThe recent bad weather has also affected preparations, but Sars have been able to come up with alternative plans when required.\n“We’ve had to adapt during the campaign and we had to adapt again last week,” Crowley said.\n“We had a match planned last Monday in the Mardyke against UCC and that went because of the weather. We had no pitch then, so we had to go to the all-weather. We were all-weather on Monday and Wednesday, as opposed to field sessions.\n“While I was very disappointed we couldn't get onto the field as this is the big week really for hurling, we couldn't get what we wanted to, I think we got a lot of value out of the all-weather, as well, you know.\n“They are not going to get any fitter and they are not going to get any fatter at the moment. They are what they are. It is probably just sharpening up a small bit.”\nCrowley’s return as manager for 2023 was driven by the late Teddy McCarthy, who had become vice-chairperson of the club.\nGoing all the way would honour the memory of the Sars, Glanmire and Cork legend as well as those of others who have passed on, while the club had to deal with their pitch being flooded in October 2023.\n“It is almost like the perfect fairytale end,” Crowley said.\n“Not to be going back, everybody knows and it is well documented, the damage that was done. It literally devastated the whole place.\n“Then on top of it, it is just incredible that you had three huge characters within the club, Ger Mulally, Teddy Mac, and Conor McCarthy, their passings really hit the club hard because they were three young men, three hugely important Sars people in different aspects.\n“Ger was treasurer of the juvenile club and doing a hell of a job. Conor was so involved in training young fellas around the place. Then Teddy was Teddy. With the disruption and these huge losses within the club, we just kept going and we kept finding and finding and finding a way.\n“At no stage did we ever, ever see ourselves playing in an All-Ireland club final. As a young lad, you will always have ambitions of, I can play in a county final because you've seen county finals.\n“I remember 1989 with my dad, God rest his soul. We played with the Glen. You are a young lad and you are saying, ‘I could possibly play in a county final some day if I applied myself right.’\n“But to think that you'd play in an All-Ireland club final, it would never come into your mindset, so if we could it would be the icing on the cake.\n“But look, we have a huge, huge task ahead of us. Hopefully.”",
