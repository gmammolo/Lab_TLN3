  "text": "Everton’s attempts to sign Ernest Nuamah from Lyon had gone quiet over the past 24 hours or so, but it appears that just meant the Premier League club were working on reaching an agreement behind the scenes.\nDavid Moyes needs an addition in attack and with the Italian media insistent every day that Beto wants to depart Goodison Park for a return to Serie A, the need is perhaps even greater than it would have otherwise been.\nRMC report on Thursday evening that Everton have come to an agreement with Lyon for Ernest Nuamah’s transfer in this window.\nAccording to the reliable French source the two clubs have reached an agreement for around €20m, so the forward would be moving on a permanent transfer.\nNow that an agreement between the clubs has been reached, Everton are in negotiations with the player over his salary and general contract.\nRMC say there’s confidence of an agreement being found between Everton and Ernest Nuamah, and this is a transfer which will now be expected to go through.",
