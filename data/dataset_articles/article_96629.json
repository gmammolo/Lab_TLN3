  "text": "SAN ANTONIO – San Antonio FC announced on Thursday it had signed midfielder Almir Soto ahead of the 2025 USL Championship season. The transaction is pending league and federation approval and work authorization, and per team policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nThe 30-year-old midfielder joins SAFC after 10 professional seasons playing in South America and Europe. Soto began his career in 2015 at Independiente Santa Fe, one of the most successful clubs in Colombia’s top-flight. There, he made 52 appearances in four seasons, helping the squad to the 2015 Copa Sudamericana and two Colombian SuperLiga championships.\nHe also spent time with other Colombian sides Fortaleza CEIF (2016) and Patriotas Boyacá (2019-20), as well as Argentinian side Nueva Chicago (2018-19).\n“Almir is an aggressive, ball-winning midfielder who is quick in transition and technical in his distribution,” said SAFC Sporting Director Marco Ferruzzi. “We are excited to welcome him to San Antonio.”\nThe Barranquilla, Colombia, native returned to the Categoría Primera A in 2021 with Asociación Deportivo Pasto, where he saw action in 20 matches. Soto then made the move to the Żebbuġ Rangers, making 23 appearances in the Malta’s Premier League in the 2022-23 season before joining Venezuelan First Division side Deportivo La Guaira. He logged 1,700 minutes as the team secured its third Copa Venezuela trophy in 2024.",
