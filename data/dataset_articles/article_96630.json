  "text": "Birmingham Legion FC has acquired center back Tiago Suarez on loan from the New England Revolution for the 2025 USL Championship season.\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. – Birmingham Legion FC announced on Thursday the club had acquired defender Tiago Suarez on loan from the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer for the 2025 USL Championship season. The transaction is pending league and federation approval.\nSuarez joins Legion having spent the past season on loan with the New England Revolution II of MLS NEXT Pro, where he made 22 appearances and recorded 22 tackles won at a 73.3 percent success rate and notched 19 interceptions and 64 recoveries. He also won 81 duels at a 56.6 percent success rate.\n“Tiago is a young player that we are excited to get into the team,” said Legion President and General Manager Jay Heaps. “He is a strong, athletic center back with a lot of potential to bring a big impact on the field for us.”\nPrior to signing with the Revolution, Suarez competed for Sacramento Republic FC as a USL Academy signing during the 2022 season. The 19-year-old made six appearances for the side in league play, logging 335 minutes, and won five tackles at a 71.4 percent success rate before signing a homegrown contract with New England.",
