  "text": "ESCANABA, Mich. (RRN) — The Bay College Norse women's basketball team improved to 2-0 in conference play with an impressive 112-59 win over the North Central Michigan College Timberwolves Wednesday night at the Bay College Gym.\nThe Norse raced out to a 30-10 lead after the first quarter and never looked back, as all nine players in uniform scored at least two points. Five of them scored in double figures, led by Menominee's Anna Axtell, who threw down 35 points on 12-of-21 shooting from the floor.\n“Any time you get a double-double, it's great, but 35 is quite a bit of points,” Norse Coach James Fassett said. “I mean, she only had two three's, so Anna was active, right? She had eight offensive rebounds. So Anna was as active all night, all over the floor.”\nBark River-Harris graduate Lauren Zawada had a career-high 25 points, making ten of the 19 shots she took. She also made four-of-five three-point attempts, had six rebounds, and contributed five steals on defense.\n“I felt good,” Zawada said. “I've been trying to shoot in the game, and I never take shots, I never did in high school. I decided that tonight is the night to start shooting them. I've been practicing them, and tonight, it felt good.”\nBay had a bit of a lull in the second quarter after jumping to that 30-10 lead, with the Timberwolves (1-15 overall, 0-2 MCCAA) playing the Norse to a near-draw on the scoreboard.\nBut in the third quarter, the Norse stepped on the gas again, outscoring the visitors from Petoskey, 35-14, to put the game away for good.\nZawada, in particular, did that, making three triples in the third quarter alone. This offensive onslaught happened as the 2-0 Muskegon College Jayhawks prepare to come to Escanaba on Saturday for an early-season showdown.\n“I think we're ready,” Zawada said. “I think we have some things that we still need to work on, but I think we're in a good spot for right now.”\nPoint guard Makenna Hendrickson of Baraga added an impressive stat line of her own in Wednesday's win: ten points, eight assists, seven steals, and six rebounds. Kennedy Sproule knocked down three triples and scored 13 points (plus six rebounds), and fellow Bark River-Harris graduate McKenzie Hoffmeyer contributed 12 points.\nThe Timberwolves had three players get double-doubles. They were led by Maziah Shelton's 16 points and eleven rebounds. Arika Taylor chipped in 14 points and ten boards, and Camile Warden added 13 points and 15 rebounds.\nBay made 12-of-46 three-point attempts; NCMC tried only four triples all night long, and made one.\nThe Bay defense forced the Timberwolves into 48 turnovers. The Norse had just seven.\nBay College improved to 9-7 overall, 2-0 in the MCCAA, with the Muskegon Jayhawks (12-3, 2-0) coming to town for a 1:00 game on Saturday.\n“We'll be ready,” Fassett promised.\nSaturday's game will be broadcast live on FM-106.3, and on-line at www.baynorse.com.\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 BY MY UP NOW – WBUP/WJMN.
