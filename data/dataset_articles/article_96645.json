  "text": "Key Takeaways\nSolana’s price soars high, holding above the $200 support zone, which suggests the price could rally to $300. Solana spot ETF approval could be a game changer for the price to hit a high of $1,000. Solana’s price will rise as the US Federal Reserve considers including US-based tokens as part of its strategic digital assets. Key events ahead of Donald Trump’s swearing-in ceremony and time in office could shape the crypto market, as the market witnessed a glimpse of such events when the price of crypto tokens rallied beyond imagination to a new high following Trump’s US presidential election win.\nAccording to the news, the US Federal Reserve plans to include US-based tokens like Solana and XRP as part of its strategic digital asset. This could lead to a price surge for XRP and Solana, with the price of Solana looking more likely to hit $1,000 per SOL every passing day.\nAfter creating new highs above $265 some months back, the price of Solana suffered a price decline towards the end of 2024 towards a region of $170 as the price has bounced from that region, trading above $200 once more as bulls build more bullish momentum ahead of a mega rally.\nSolana remained one of the best performers of 2024, beating the likes of Ethereum and Bitcoin to this performance as the price of Solana rallied from a low of $10 following the FTX collapse to reclaim a high of $265, which is over 25 rally from low.\nWith such a price rally, many traders and investors will undoubtedly continue to keep a close eye on Solana’s price action. SOL has shown great price action and will continue to do so in the coming months.\nSolana Price Prediction For Tomorrow, Weekly, 2025 Source – SOL Price Prediction By CryptoJelle On X\nSolana’s price has passed through transformative growth over the past few years from the thick of its bear run. The team and community have stock with SOL as the price looks set for a major price rally.\nApart from its steady price growth from 2023, the price of Solana and its ecosystem has witnessed real growth with its technology and influx of many developers willing to build on its platform as a result of fast transactions and low fees, making its network convenient and efficient for many small crypto projects and memecoins.\nWith Solana enjoying so many benefits from crypto adoption, this has placed its price in a position to rally as high as $1,000 before the end of 2025, based on crypto market analysis.\nSolana’s price action looks great after breaking and closing above $200, as the price looks set for a major rally on the daily timeframe. CryptoJelle shares a similar sentiment surrounding Solana’s price after breaking out of its downtrend. The crypto analyst expects the price of Solana to rally to a high of $330 in the next few months.\nShort-term targets for Solana remain $222, where the price would face minor resistance. A break and close above $222 could see the price of Solana rally to a high of $265 and beyond.\nTechnical indicators predictions:\nMACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) – Bullish\nRSI (Relative Strength Index) – Trades above 55\nKey ADA Support Zone – $200",
