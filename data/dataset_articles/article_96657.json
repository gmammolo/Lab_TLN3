  "text": "Return to the Complex\nJulio Rodriguez has rejoined the training complex after spending the past several days sidelined by illness. After being scratched from the lineup on Monday and absent from games on Tuesday and Wednesday, he has been observed working in the batting cage at the facility. This return marks an important step in his gradual recovery as he prepares for the upcoming season.\nMeasured Approach to Recovery\nThe decision to ease Rodriguez back into full activity reflects a thoughtful strategy. Rather than rushing his return, the coaching staff is allowing him to regain his timing and build strength at a comfortable pace. The option to gain extra at-bats during minor league games provides him with the opportunity to lead off each inning, helping him gradually recapture his form without the pressure of immediate high-stakes performance.\nSeason Outlook and Recent Performance\nRodriguez, known for his star status as a two-time All-Star and Silver Slugger, is coming off a season marked by a .273 average along with 20 home runs and 24 stolen bases. Despite battling inconsistency, a slow start, and an ankle injury, his work ethic and talent remain evident. With Opening Day just a week away, his gradual return to practice signals readiness for a promising season and the continued evolution of a key figure for his team.",
