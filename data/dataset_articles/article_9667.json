  "text": "A fire that charred 28 acres in hilly terrain near Steele Canyon High School in the Jamul area Wednesday afternoon was reported to be 85% contained by Thursday morning, a fire official said.\nThe blaze, which was reported around 2:10 p.m. off Star Acres Drive near Steele Canyon Road, north of state Route 94, prompted the evacuation of homes in the area.\nThe fire burned an area east of the high school and west of Steele Canyon, said Cal Fire Capt. Robert Johnson. Evacuation orders were lifted Wednesday night, allowing residents to return to their homes.\nThere have been no reports of structures damaged. Johnson said some residents were using hoses to clean fire retardant that had been dropped on their homes the previous day when several helicopters and fixed-wing tankers battled the flames.\n“Crews are still out here working, two hand crews as well as three fire engines,” Johnson said.\nHe said firefighters would work throughout the day, and fire officials expected to get 100% containment by the end of the day.\n“They are not going to leave until we see that all the hot spots within the perimeter are extinguished,” he said.\nThe cause of the blaze remains under investigation.\nOriginally Published: July 10, 2025 at 11:13 AM PDT For the record: A previous version of this story misidentified the Cal Fire captain interviewed.",
