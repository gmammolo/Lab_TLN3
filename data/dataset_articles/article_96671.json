  "text": "Turner Aims for Breakout 2025 Season with Cowboys Following Injury Struggles\nPayton Turner, a former first-round pick, is optimistic about his potential with the Dallas Cowboys after struggling with injuries during his time with the New Orleans Saints. The Saints declined his fifth-year option after he played only 15 games and recorded just three sacks in three seasons. Now, under defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus, Turner believes that a different scheme focused on penetration will help unleash his abilities alongside star teammates like Micah Parsons. He’s implemented significant changes to his training and recovery routines to enhance his durability and performance.\n- Turner played a career-high 16 games in 2024.\n- He tied his career-high with two sacks in that same season.\n- Turner aims to overcome past injuries and maintain consistency in performance.\n- He is adapting to a new training routine focused on mobility, nutrition, and injury prevention.\nAs the 2025 season approaches, Turner will seek to solidify his role in the Cowboys' defense, aiming for a breakout year that will validate his potential as a first-round pick.\nBottom LineIf Payton Turner can leverage his new training methods and the Cowboys’ defensive scheme, he may finally reach the expectations set for him as a top draft pick, potentially transforming a one-year deal into a long-term success story.\nRead more at CBSSports.com\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
