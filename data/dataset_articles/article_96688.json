  "text": "Switzerland-based Nigerian coach, Adedeji Adeyemi Anthony has backed the Super Eagles to pick the maximum points against Rwanda and Zimbabwe when the 2026 World Cup qualifiers gets underway on Friday in Kigali, Rwanda.\nAdedeji who played for Stationary Stores Fc of Lagos during his younger days was highly impressed by the 23-man squad released by head coach Eric Chelle recently and have been calling on Nigerians to rally round the coach as one of the best.\nAdedeji believed that Super Eagles have the quality to win both games with attack minded coach like Chelle in the saddle.\n“Chelle must have watched how the Rwandese set up and play. In Uyo, the Super Eagles were not able to break down their compact defensive formation in the process conceding two goals within five minutes before rallying to a draw.\n“Chelle must find a way to unlock their tactical and defensive formation and find solution to it. The players are in the mood , they have the motivation and desires to run behind the defence with penetrating passes to go for victory” he said.\n“I’m 100 percent sure that we are going to win in Kigali. We have done it before , we can do it again. After that, coming to Uyo on Tuesday to face Zimbabwe will be easy.\n“Though Zimbabwe is not a pushover but we have what it takes to be victorious.\n“I wish the boys the best and, obviously, I’ll be watching as well, and I’m sure they will win both matches.” Adedeji told Blueprint Sport on phone from Switzerland.\nThe Super Eagles will face Rwanda in Kigali on Friday, March 21 by 5pm Nigerian time and host Zimbabwe four days later in Uyo, Akwa-Ibom state.",
