  "text": "There always has to be a first to make history in the NFL.\nAt cornerback, that appears to be Houston Texans star Derek Stingley Jr.\nStingley, fresh off an All-Pro season and top-five finish in defensive metrics, officially signed his three-year, $90 million extension that will make him the highest-paid cornerback in NFL history. Locked in through 2029, the third-year cornerback will be the first defensive back to earn $30 million per season.\nWhile Carolina Panthers corner Jaycee Horn recently inked a $100 million extension, his annual salary is only $25 million.",
