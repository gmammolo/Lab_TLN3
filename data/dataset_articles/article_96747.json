  "text": "Former NFL quarterback and offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich is joining the coaching staff under Deion Sanders at Colorado, Jordan Schultz of Fox Sports reported Wednesday. The reports come a day after Leftwich was spotted at practice holding a clipboard and wearing Colorado football gear. Sanders said on Monday Colorado would make \"a couple more huge moves\" this week but has not confirmed Leftwich's hiring. It's unclear what Leftwich's role will be on Sanders' staff. Leftwich interviewed with the New England Patriots for their head coaching post in January. Leftwich, 45, most recently worked as the offensive coordinator for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2019-22, a stint that included a Super Bowl win in the 2020 season. Leftwich was fired by Bucs head coach Todd Bowles after the 2022 season, which saw Tampa Bay slip from the top 3 in scoring the previous three seasons to No. 15 in yards and No. 25 in points in 2022. A quarterback and first-round pick by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2003 NFL Draft, Leftwich had a 24-26 record with 10,532 passing yards and 58 touchdowns in 60 games with the Jaguars (2003-06), Atlanta Falcons (2007), Bucs (2009) and Steelers (2008, 2010, 2012). He also worked in various roles including the interim offensive coordinator for the Arizona Cardinals from 2016-2018. --Field Level Media\nReport: Byron Leftwich joining Colorado coaching staff\n- Field Level Media\n- Updated\n0\nPost a comment as anonymous\nReport\nWatch this discussion.
