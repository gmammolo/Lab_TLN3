  "text": "In the form of his life since the start of 2025, Ousmane Dembélé (27) has become a serious candidate to win the Ballon d’Or.\nA new poll by L’Équipe has the Frenchman in the lead for that prestigious award by a considerable margin.\nThe former World Cup winner in 2018 received 40.9% of the votes in their mid-March poll, followed by FC Barcelona’s Raphinha (28) at 25% and his Barça teammate Lamine Yamal (17) receiving 8.8%.\nFrench captain Kylian Mbappé (26) was fourth with 8%, with Mohamed Salah rounding out the top five by earning 7.4% of the votes.\nAprès des 8es de finale de Ligue des champions qui pourraient coûter cher à Mohamed Salah, vous voyez Ousmane Dembélé loin devant la concurrence dans la course au Ballon d'Or, avec cinq fois plus de votes que Kylian Mbappé\n➡️ https://t.co/OrtJdaFDKJ pic.twitter.com/Phb1AeJH3X\n— L'ÉQUIPE (@lequipe) March 14, 2025 Neither Dembélé nor Mbappé have won the Ballon d’Or before, with the latter finishing third in voting in 2023. The last Frenchman to win the trophy was Karim Benzema (37) in 2022 while at Real Madrid.\nDembélé leads Ligue 1 with 20 goals this season. He scored the equaliser in PSG’s second-leg tie with Liverpool last week, enabling them to advance on penalties.\nThe Frenchman has been on top form in 2025, finding the back of the net 21 times in 16 games.\nHe has 29 goals across all competitions this season for PSG, far exceeding his previous best single-season total at Barcelona when he netted 14 competitive goals in 2018-19.\nDembélé can make an impression on the international stage tomorrow when France take on Croatia in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Nations League.\nThe Vernon-born player has only scored six international goals for Didier Deschamps’ men, the last one coming last September in a Nations League clash against Belgium.",
