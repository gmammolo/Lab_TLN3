  "text": "Now Playing Share Share Video Link copied! Burleson popped a solo home run -- his third of the spring -- in Wednesday's Grapefruit League tilt versus the Nationals.\nDrawing the start at first base, Burleson led off the bottom of the third inning with a long ball off of Jake Irvin. Although he's batting only .209 this spring, Burleson's three home runs trail only Luken Baker's four for the team lead. Burleson's playing time might be impacted if the Cardinals elect to go with Victor Scott or Michael Siani as their primary center fielder, as it would likely mean Nolan Gorman being used more at designated hitter. The left-handed hitting Burleson slashed .292/.341/.464 versus right-handed pitching last season but batted only .242/.306/.320 in the second half.\nMore News Cardinals' Alec Burleson: Could face playing time squeeze 8D ago • by RotoWire Staff Cardinals' Alec Burleson: Won't play outfield this spring 13D ago • by RotoWire Staff Cardinals' Alec Burleson: Drives in three in win 09/30/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Cardinals' Alec Burleson: Out again versus lefty 09/26/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Cardinals' Alec Burleson: Idle against southpaw 09/25/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Cardinals' Alec Burleson: Getting rest against lefty 09/21/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Baseball Stories Bullpen breakdown for all 30 teams Scott White • 4 min read Bold predictions for all 30 MLB Teams Chris Towers • 19 min read 12-team Roto mock draft Scott White • 4 min read Fantasy baseball rankings: ADP sleepers, busts CBS Sports Staff • 4 min read 2025 Fantasy baseball rankings: Sleepers to target CBS Sports Staff • 3 min read Draft Prep Guide (all in one place) CBS Interactive staff • 2 min read",
