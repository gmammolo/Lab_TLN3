  "text": "Kilgore sends pumps to help drain flooded areas for ongoing search in Kerr County\nCENTER POINT, Texas (KLTV) - Blake Holland reports from Kerr County, where crews with cadaver dogs are still searching for those missing.\nAfter months’ worth of heavy rain fell in a matter of hours on Texas Hill Country last week, the community has come together with support from other regions in Texas to begin to recover.\nSearch and rescue efforts are still underway, but continued rain has made the effort challenging.\nIn Center Point, Texas, pumps from Kilgore are being used to drain specific areas so that responders can better search. They are carefully sorting through debris as part of a sensitive process to find the bodies of those still missing.\nDuring the flood, the Guadalupe River overflowed its borders to cover areas usually not affected, carrying debris as it overturned trailers, submerged vehicles and left behind a long path of damage.\nCopyright 2025 KLTV.
