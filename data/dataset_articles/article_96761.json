  "text": "Aliaksei Protas’s career year has been a lot of things: surprising, encouraging, and, at times, jaw-dropping. Now, it’s record-breaking.\nTuesday, after notching two assists against the Detroit Red Wings, Protas (61) eclipsed Yegor Sharangovich (59) for the most points by a Belarus-born player in a single season. Sharangovich set the record last season as a member of the Calgary Flames when he scored 31 goals and collected 28 assists in 82 games.\nThe news was first reported by Capitals PR.\nWith two assists against Detroit, Aliaksei Protas brought his season point total to 61 (29g, 32a). Protas' 61 points are the most by a Belarus-born player in a single season in NHL history (previously Yegor Sharangovich, 59 points in 2023-24).\n— Capitals PR (@CapitalsPR) March 19, 2025\nProtas’s big year comes during his age-23 season and marks a 32-point improvement over his performance in 2023-24.\nMost points in a single season (Belarus-born) Player Pts GP Season Aliaksei Protas 61 68 2024-25 Yegor Sharangovich 59 82 2023-24 Mikhail Grabovski 58 81 2010-11 Andrei Kostitsyn 53 78 2007-08 Vladimir Tsyplakov 52 73 1997-98 Mikhail Grabovski 51 74 2011-12 Sergei Kostitsyn 50 77 2010-11 Mikhail Grabovski 48 78 2008-09 Yegor Sharangovich 46 76 2021-22 Andrei Kostitsyn 45 81 2010-11 S/T to Quant Hockey for the list.\nThe only other former Capital to join Protas on the list is Mikhail Grabovski , who, in his age-29 season with the Caps, notched 35 points (13g, 22a) in 58 games during the 2013-14 campaign — good for 15th best ever.\nAfter spending much of last season in the bottom six, Protas has 29 goals, 32 assists, and 61 points while skating primarily on the first and second lines this season. Protas recently notched his first career hat trick against the Anaheim Ducks on March 12 .\n\"He's one of our most valuable players every night.\"\nAliaksei Protas is having himself an incredible season! 🤩 pic.twitter.com/iBnwOGL9zb\n— NHL (@NHL) March 19, 2025\nStatistically speaking, the six-foot-six, 247-pound forward has been one of the best players in the NHL. Incredibly, 56 of Protas’s 61 points have come at even strength (7th best in the NHL). His 46 five-on-five points are sixth-most in the league and pace all Capitals skaters (PLD has 44).\nProtas leads the NHL in plus-minus at plus-42. The next closer player is Tampa Bay Lightning defenseman Ryan McDonagh, who is a plus-32.\nBig Pro also has 17 multi-point games after posting eight the year before. There are still 14 games remaining in the season.\n“He’s doing such a good job at five-on-five and on the penalty kill and in so many different areas inside…how well he’s putting pressure on the opposing defenseman, creating turnovers, good with his stick,” Capitals head coach Spencer Carbery said of Protas earlier in the year . “And then when he’s getting into scoring areas, you can just tell he’s got a ton of confidence. His shot’s improved. He’s hitting his spot… Happy for him because he’s worked so hard and he’s such a great person and he’s so down to earth, so it’s nice to see him having so much individual success.”",
