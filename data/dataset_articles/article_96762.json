  "text": "I n what was already a highly anticipated episode with Ben Stiller as a guest on the New Heights podcast, Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce enjoyed a great show accompanied by the comedian who revealed an Aaron Rodgers anecdote that ended in praise for the Quarterback who has yet to find a team in the NFL .\nBen Stiller's story with Aaron Rodgers The three were talking about how complex it must be a player, joking about playbooks and how complicated it must be to learn all the terms or moves, when Stiller pitched a story with the now former New York Jets Quarterback.\nKYLIE DRINKS WHILE PREGNANT\n\"When we were making Zoolander 2, Aaron Rogers came to Italy. I asked him, 'Okay, you know how you do it on the line when you have to make those split-second decisions,' and he said it's actually not as complicated as they paint it on TV, and I said, 'Yeah, but you're Aaron Rogers, so it probably is a little bit, but it sounds the same...',\" Ben Stiller recounted with laughter alongside Travis and Jason, who didn't hesitate to throw out praise for the player.\n\"He's a complicated men (Aaron Rodgers), that's a guy who knows a lot,\" he said, adding \"Aaron Aaron is another level of the intellectual ability for the game uh so obviously it's very much easier for him than a lot of other guys\".\nKYLIE DRINKS WHILE PREGNANT Travis Kelce had the same to say about Andy Reid It was to be expected that a great coach like Andy Reid would be obsessive about plays, so within the same topic, the Kansas City Chiefs Tight End told how his coach has at times come in excited about a lot of plays that represent more study for the players.\n\"I joke about coach Reid coming in with like an index like stack like this big of just like a rubber band around and you just see plays drawn up on them and he's just like I got some good stuff guys,\" recounted Travis Kelce.",
