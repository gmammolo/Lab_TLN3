Javier Rodríguez top scored for the blaugranes with six, while Cikusa returned after six weeks out.\nDifficult start\nBoth sides' attack was misfiring from the off so goals were a bit hard to come by, so much so that the score was only 5 - 4 halfway through the first half. Defences were on top, with goalkeepers Decsi and Nielsen making six and five saves respectively. However, Ortega's side showed just what they are made of and went into overdrive.\nBlown away\nThe blaugranes scored 9 without reply through quick transitions and goals by Bazán, Janc, N’Guessan (3), Javier Rodríguez (3) and Richardson, while Emil Nielsen made another five saves to make it 10 in 15 shots (5-13, min 24). That then paved way to a calm period in the game, halftime score 7-16.\nMore of the same\nThe home side attempted to come back after the restart (10-17, min 33), but Barça quickly hit back, this time led by Dika Mem, who scored three goals early on and the lead grew to 12-23 by the 40th minute.\nMakuc and Aleix Gómez also scored two and five respectively in the second half to extend the blaugrana control. Young Filip Saric replaced Nielsen in goal and put in another solid performance with six saves. Final score 21-39 and another win for the clear leaders of the Liga Plenitude.\nNext up, Viveros Herol Nava visit the Palau Blaugrana for the Liga Plenitude gameweek 21 fixture (22 Mar 1.00pm CET).\nGAME STATS\nBada Huesca 21\nBarça 39\nBada Huesca: Decsi (-), Borragan Fernández (3), Pérez (3), Paulo (6), Frank Cordiés (1), Parera (1), Malo (2) -starting seven- Arguillas (-), Cánovas (-), García (1), De Souza (-), Moya (1), Suárez (1), Nasarre (-), Nenadic (2), Samuel Cordiés (-).\nBarça: Nielsen (-), Janc (1), Mem (4), Petrus (-), Bazán (5), Palomino (1), Wanne (1) -starting seven- Saric (-), Carlsbogard (1), Ariño (3), N'Guessan (3), Aleix Gómez (5), Makuc (2), Richardson (4), Cikusa (3), Rodríguez (6).\nPeriods: 2-1; 4-3; 5-5; 5-9; 6-14; 7-16 // 10-19; 12-23; 14-27; 17-30; 20-35; 21-39.\nReferees: Lorena García Gil and Tania Rodríguez Estévez.\n- Viber\n- Messenger\n- Copy link",
