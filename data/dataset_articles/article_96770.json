  "text": "The NCAA is on some real clown ish for this.\nThe 2025 edition of March Madness began Tuesday evening with two “First Four” contests being played to determine who officially gets into the big dance. During the games, fans were treated to … if you ask me … some outright comedy.\nWith sports betting becoming the new norm, it’s not just the teams in the NCAA tournament that will be dealing with high stakes, so will millions of Americans when they slap bets on the action. (RELATED: First Game Of March Madness Ends With Unbelievable Hail Mary Game-Winner)\nWith this being the case, the NCAA hilariously felt the need to launch a sports betting commercial Tuesday that basically blasts people who harass student-athletes over lost bets as blatant losers. They actually used that word, which makes this whole thing even more funny.\nIn fact, the advertisement is called “Don’t Be a Loser,” and just … check this thing out.\nWATCH:\n‘Don’t Be a Loser’: @NCAA launches sports betting anti-harassment video.\n🔗 https://t.co/P90rwvCcCj pic.twitter.com/tZLBfWzUbm\n— NCAA News (@NCAA_PR) March 18, 2025\nIt’s comical to me that the NCAA actually felt the need to do this, and how they did it just makes it even better. But while I’m at it, it’ll prove to be completely ineffective.\nAs long as sports betting is involved that gives people the ability to be emotionally connected to their wallet in a sporting event, there will always be angry fans that harass players. They gotta hit those parlays!\nI get what the NCAA is trying to do, but it won’t work. Thanks for the comedy, though.",
