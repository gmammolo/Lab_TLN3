  "text": "Now Playing Share Share Video Link copied! Nootbaar reached base three times and scored a pair of runs Wednesday as the Cardinals defeated the Nationals in Grapefruit League play.\nNootbaar singled twice and drew a walk and is now sporting a .480 on-base percentage this spring. He hit leadoff Wednesday and is a candidate to bat there during the regular season, but Masyn Winn (wrist) -- who didn't play Wednesday -- is still the likely favorite to hit at the top of the batting order for St. Louis.\nMore News Cardinals' Lars Nootbaar: Wins arbitration case 02/12/2025 • by RotoWire Staff Cardinals' Lars Nootbaar: Homer, triple in win 09/28/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Cardinals' Lars Nootbaar: Two hits, homer 09/27/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Cardinals' Lars Nootbaar: Sitting against lefty 09/25/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Cardinals' Lars Nootbaar: Resting versus southpaw 09/21/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Cardinals' Lars Nootbaar: Slugs 10th homer 09/16/2024 • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Baseball Stories Bullpen breakdown for all 30 teams Scott White • 4 min read Bold predictions for all 30 MLB Teams Chris Towers • 19 min read 12-team Roto mock draft Scott White • 4 min read Fantasy baseball rankings: ADP sleepers, busts CBS Sports Staff • 4 min read 2025 Fantasy baseball rankings: Sleepers to target CBS Sports Staff • 3 min read Draft Prep Guide (all in one place) CBS Interactive staff • 2 min read",
