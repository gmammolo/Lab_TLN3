  "text": "FERRAN TORRES\nFerran Torres opens up: His expectations about Barça's treble, his future at the club...\nPublished:19/03/2025 - 23:09h\nUpdated:19/03/2025 - 23:10h\nFerran Torres' expectations about the treble and his current situation at FC Barcelona\nFerran Torres has undeniably become an extremely valuable player for Hansi Flick. Why? Because the forward, at just 25 years old, has managed to adapt to his role in the Barça B team, transforming into an important alternative for various positions in the attacking front and, most crucially, has responded with goals, demonstrating stellar sporting performance.\nBeyond the sporting aspect, the forward gave an extensive interview to 'Mundo Deportivo', where, among other things, he spoke about the chances of achieving a treble that FC Barcelona has. Additionally, the '7' addressed various topics related to his current situation in the Catalan team.\nFC Barcelona's chances of achieving the treble this season\nFerran wanted to emphasize an ideal that seems to gain strength as FC Barcelona continues to accumulate great results: the achievement of the treble, a concept that the Barcelona team is starting to believe in. \"We are a dreaming team, and we see ourselves capable. We are still alive in all competitions, and until we either win or get eliminated, we will believe it\", he specified.\nFerran sees himself many years as a player for the culé club\nAmong the topics that the 'Shark' addressed, he did not hesitate to immediately dismiss any rumor that places him outside of FC Barcelona, emphasizing that he sees himself many more years wearing the jersey of the culé team. \"I see myself at Barça, I still have several years of contract here and I see myself here. I am very happy. The coach conveys that confidence to me, and that is the most important thing for me,\" he remarked.\n\"I see myself at Barça, I still have several years of contract here and I see myself here\"\nAlthough he also acknowledged that the issue of extending the contract that links him to the azulgranas until June 30, 2027 has not yet been put on the table, he has left the option open for it to be discussed soon. \"There are many renewals before mine at Barça, of players who are excelling. If the day comes to sit down and negotiate, I would be delighted. My doors will always be open,\" he pointed out.\n\"There are many renewals before mine at Barça\"\nThe 'Shark' contributes a lot as a stellar substitute, but...\nOn an individual level, Ferran Torres has acknowledged that he is now fully adapted to his role as the fourth forward of FC Barcelona, a position that requires being prepared and having a strong mentality to be influential when the commitment demands it. Despite this, the Valencian is clear that he is not satisfied with the minutes he plays, although this does not prevent him from being happy as a player for the Barcelona team.\n\"To be in the elite, you cannot be complacent. There are three in front who can be the most regular starters, but that’s why I’m always there, to take advantage of every minute, to contribute as many goals as I can so that the coach sees that I can be a starter,\" he emphasized.\nThe competition with Robert Lewandowski\nFor his part, the former Manchester City player also acknowledged the role that Robert Lewandowski is playing in his learning and adaptation to the center forward role. \"Now there is a center forward who is, for me, one of the best in football history. He is helping me learn from him and consolidate myself in a position I had never played before and that I now feel very comfortable in. I have always said that I have a lot of confidence in myself and that I could be a starting forward for Barça\", he concluded.\n\"He is helping me learn from him and consolidate myself in a position I had never played before\"\nIt is his best moment since arriving at FC Barcelona\nAt this point, it would not be far-fetched to assert that Ferran Torres is experiencing his best season as a player for FC Barcelona. Despite not having enjoyed many minutes this 2024-25 season, he has scored 13 goals, surpassing his record of 11 set last season. This is also attributed to his mentality. \"I believe I am in a very sweet moment. There have also been difficult moments, injuries, but in terms of football, I could be in the best moment of Barça,\" he admitted.\nAn increase in his level of play that the former Valencia CF player has attributed not only to his famous 'Shark' mentality but also to the influence of coach Hansi Flick. \"Flick, from day one, has always conveyed his confidence to me. He has given me a lot of value. Every player wants to feel this way, important, valued, and then, day to day, he is a super close person,\" he concluded.",
