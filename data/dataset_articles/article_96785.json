The contract also includes an additional $6 million in incentives and escalators, designed to reward key defensive plays such as interceptions.\nPlayer Transition and Background\nPreviously with the San Francisco 49ers, Hufanga made a name for himself with a combination of physical play and sharp instincts in the secondary. His transition to the Broncos marks a significant career move, positioning him as a central figure in the team’s defensive plans and solidifying his reputation among emerging safety talents.\nStrategic Impact on the Broncos Defense\nThe investment in Hufanga highlights the Broncos’ intent to fortify their defensive line. By linking a substantial portion of the deal to performance-driven metrics, the organization emphasizes a commitment to excellence on the field.
