  "text": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim knows he needs more goalscoring options, as Rasmus Hojlund is not ready yet to shoulder the burden of the club’s attack alone.\nAlejandro Garnacho returned to goalscoring ways against the Foxes just like the Dane but he still needs to improve his finishing .\nAmad is the only other genuine attacking option but he is currently sidelined. Both Antony and Marcus Rashford are likely to depart in the summer.\nA versatile option like Kenan Yildiz of Juventus makes a lot of sense given he can play all across the frontline. He has six goals and four assists this season.\nYildiz contact However, Teamtalk reveals that not all is well between the 19-year-old and Thiago Motta and Juventus are open to his sale should they fail to qualify for the Champions League.\nThe Bianconeri are currently fifth and could demand as much as €90 million for his sale as they look to rebuild the squad after a disappointing campaign this time.\nJournalist Rudy Galetti has even claimed that the Red Devils have initiated contact with the Serie A giants over a potential summer move.\n“Manchester United have made initial contact for Kenan Yildiz, sources have told TEAMtalk, with the Red Devils ready to make a move for the winger as we reveal Juventus’s stance on a potential exit.\n“Sources have told TEAMtalk that although Juventus consider Yildiz a key player in their team, the Italian giants are willing to cash in on him.\nJuventus seeking €90m “The Serie A club, though, will not sell the Turkey international on the cheap and have set a potential price-tag of around €90 million.”\nThe Turkish wonderkid fits the INEOS profile of a young superstar with room to improve but given his price tag, a deal for the price mentioned seems beyond the club’s reach at the moment.\nThe likes of Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool are also eyeing the Turkiye international while the Turin-based side will also try and convince the attacker to stay, especially if Motta ends up departing.\nMore contacts between both clubs are expected in the coming weeks and an update on this could arrive soon. The player, said to be “ more talented than Cristiano Ronaldo” has a contract with the Bianconeri until 2029.\nIt must also be remembered that what Amorim needs most right now is an elite striker and United might not have the funds for both Yildiz and a ruthless finisher.",
