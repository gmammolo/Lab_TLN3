  "text": "Will Wade, Mr. Strong-Ass Offer, former VCU coach, former LSU coach, now the coach at McNeese State, who let slip yesterday that he’d talked to NC State about its basketball job, will be the new coach at NC State after the NCAA Tournament.\nAn AD with any amount of self-respect and self-awareness would be embarrassed beyond recognition if anybody found out that a sleazebag like Will Wade was even under consideration.\nWhat does that say about Boo Corrigan, a guy that more than a few people in UVA circles still whine about because he didn’t get the AD job at Virginia?\nGive Corrigan credit, I guess, for being able to look past what got Wade fired at LSU in 2022, and earned him a 10-game suspension and two-year show-cause penalty when he wormed his way back into the basketball business in 2023 at McNeese State.\nWade wins – he was 40-25 in two years at Chattanooga, took both of his VCU teams to the NCAA Tournament, and was 105-51 in five seasons at LSU, with a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 2019.\nAnd at McNeese State, he’s 49-8 with a pair of NCAA bids.\nIt’s how he wins that’s the issue.\nYou can dismiss the “strong-ass offer” as, well, now it’s legal to pay players, which, fine.\nIt’s not legal, never will be, to offer hush money to a witness, to try to stonewall an investigation by refusing to supply records.\nAnd then there’s the ethics of lawyering up to strong-arm the school into keeping him on the job for an extra year.\nThe guy is slime.\nI got several emails from UVA fans asking me why Wade wasn’t on Virginia’s radar.\nWill Wade shouldn’t be on any college AD’s radar.\nThe guy would have a hard time getting past a job interview at your local McDonald’s.\nLSU, for god’s sake, the kingfish of the SEC – motto: if you ain’t cheatin’, you ain’t tryin’ – fired Will Wade.\nUVA dodged two bullets – not hiring Boo Corrigan, and thus not having this Will Wade creep on our basketball sidelines.",
