  "text": "Mia Venner on 'rollercoaster ride' back into Red Roses contention\nJorja Miller isn’t one to shy away from a challenge. Miller is unanimously considered one of the world’s best players on the HSBC SVNS Series with the Black Ferns Sevens, and the 21-year-old isn’t done there with the Women’s\nRugby World Cup now a new target.\nOn Wednesday, it was announced that seven Black Ferns Sevens stars had entered the race for national selection ahead of the showpiece event in England, which begins on August 22 and later ends on September 27 at Twickenham’s Allianz Stadium.\nStacey Waaka and Theresa Setefano both helped the Black Ferns take out the World Cup title on home soil with that famous win over England a few years ago, and the two-time Olympic gold medallists are hoping to help the Black Ferns repeat history in a matter of months.\nAlena Saili,\nDhys Faleafaga and Kelsey Teneti have also already played for the Black Ferns, but the same can’t be said for New Zealand’s sevens vice-captain Risi Pouri-Lane and Miller who are preparing to embark on an exciting new journey.\nIt’s been reported that both Miller and Waaka will be available for the Black Ferns Sevens when the SVNS Series World Championship is held in May, with the duo linking up with the Black Ferns and the other five code-hoppers during World Rugby’s Pacific Four Series.\n“A World Cup in England is second best to a World Cup in New Zealand so that’s really exciting,” Miller explained in a video on the Black Ferns’ Instagram.\n“Just knowing that it was an opportunity, like it’s not going to be easy and man, they’ve got a pretty stacked team already.\n“I can really grow and just learn off the girls. There are some high, high-level professionals in that team with heaps of knowledge that, man, I’d just love to learn off and just be a sponge which I think is really exciting, like a whole new challenge.\nView this post on Instagram\n“Can’t wait for a maul, scrum, the dirty work.”\nMiller has become a core member of the Black Ferns Sevens in recent seasons, with the young talent recognised by World Rugby with a nomination for Sevens Player of the Year in 2024, although that award was later won by try-scoring machine Maddison Levi.\nOn December 12, Miller became the second-youngest rugby player in New Zealand to take out the prestigious Kelvin R Tremain Memorial Player of the Year honour at the ASB Rugby Awards. Legendary All Black\nJonah Lomu was the youngest recipient in its 30-year history.\nWith Team New Zealand claiming Paris Olympics gold last year, with Miller and Waaka both playing a starring role in that run to glory, it goes without saying that these seven athletes jumping codes are world-class in their field.\nBut, as Miller explained, it’s a “whole new challenge” in 15s.\n“Having the ability to add players in the mix that have a proven ability of winning pinnacle events under pressure is invaluable,” Black Ferns Director of Rugby, Allan Bunting, said in a statement.\n“It’s great to have our best female athletes driving internal competition and striving for selection for the World Cup.”\nNews, stats, live rugby and more!\nDownload the new RugbyPass app on the App Store (iOS) and Google Play (Android) now!\nJoin free and tell us what you really think!\nTaniela Tupou's form has tailed off in New South Wales, and how his franchise and national teams need the mighty prop at his best.\nThe former Bath and Toulon coach has taken on the challenge of returning Canadian rugby to its former glories\nA storied rugby institution, the Irish representation from Ulster has fallen away to a trickle in recent years and that is a concern",
