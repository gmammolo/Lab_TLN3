  "text": "RMU leaves for Cleveland as team prepares to take on Alabama in NCAA Tournament\nThe Robert Morris Colonials left for Cleveland Wednesday in hopes of making history as they take on the No. 2 seeded Alabama Crimson Tide in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\n\"We can talk here, about like 20 minutes or 1 hour about Alabama. What Alabama does. What Alabama can do. What Alabama can not do sometimes. We can talk here for hours but I think the key is us,\" Alvaro Folgueiras said.\n\"I mean, just look at what we've done. All year we've been count out all year. But, you know, it's a basketball game. At the end of day, we all lace up the same way; we have been playing since we were kids and (now we are going to be) on a bigger stage. A bigger stage. So, you know, it's going to be a dogfight,\" Guard DJ Smith said.\nForward Amarion Dickerson touched on playing in his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio.\n\"It means a lot. I always want to embrace it anytime that I'll be able to go home and play in front of a whole crowd. Play in front of everyone in the family. You know, my friends, everybody watched me growing up. Everybody had a hand, helping me get to where I'm at right now. So, it definitely means a lot to me. I really just focus on trying to just work,\" Dickerson said.\nRMU came off an electric season, finishing the best record in the Horizon League and winning the Horizon League tournament to punch their ticket into the NCAA Tournament.\nHowever, for Head Coach Andy Toole, that’s in the past, and all eyes are on Friday’s game.\n\"You know, just keep working. Keep preparing. I don't think we've done anything differently than we would have a week ago. Two weeks ago, or six weeks ago. And that's kind of what we talked about with our team is, hey, we got practice. And so, we got to practice. You know, we got to flip the switch from cloud nine, as you mentioned, to, you know, preparation,\" Toole said.\nWith the team representing western Pennsylvania in the big dance, the buzz around Moon Township is also alive and growing.\n\"Oh, it's fantastic because their reputation as a university is well known and respected and a beautiful campus. So maybe this introduction to the country will bring more people to the university,\" Jim Wagner said.\nJohn Loub with Primanti Brothers said they already prepared to have additional staff come in on game day to deal with the influx of people.\n\" Yeah, anytime that you can have a local team, whether it's Pitt, Duquesne or RMU, it's awesome to see that. And the fact that RMU hasn't been there for the last ten years and now gets back into the big dance, it's really cool,\" Loub said.",
