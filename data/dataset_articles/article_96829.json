  "text": "March is here, and the Texas Longhorns hope to bring the madness to the NCAA Tournament.\nRodney Terry and the Horns open up postseason play against the Xavier Musketeers in the First Four Round held in Dayton, Ohio.\nTexas opened as a 2.5-point underdog to Xavier, perFanDuel, whose campus is only an hour from where the First Four is held. The Longhorns are a massive underdog to win the NCAA Championship, at +100000 odds, per FanDuel.\nOur voters in this week's SB Nation Reacts survey agree with the oddsmakers, giving Texas/Xavier a 6% chance of reaching the Sweet Sixteen in the Midwest region of the bracket.\nThe winner of Texas/Xavier will play the No. 6 seed Illinois on Friday night in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Rodney Terry led the Longhorns to an Elite Eight appearance in 2023 and reached the Round of 32 in 2024 as the head coach.",
