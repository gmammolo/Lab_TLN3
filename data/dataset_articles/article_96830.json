  "text": "According to multiple reports, Will Wade, a Clemson alum and former Tigers graduate assistant (2005-07), has agreed to become the next head coach at NC State.\nWade has experienced significant success as head coach of McNeese State, capturing two consecutive Southland Conference championships. His career includes previous head coaching roles at Chattanooga, VCU, and LSU. During his time at LSU (2017-22), Wade led the Tigers to three NCAA Tournament appearances but was dismissed due to NCAA violations that resulted in a 10-game suspension carried over to his tenure at McNeese.\nWade confirmed his communication with NC State during a press conference Wednesday morning, acknowledging openly the ongoing speculation about his future. \"Just tell it like it is,\" Wade said. He stressed the importance of transparency with his players, especially with their NCAA Tournament matchup against Clemson approaching on Thursday afternoon.\nHe enters the NC State role with an overall coaching record of 243-104, along with seven NCAA Tournament appearances.\nNC State parted ways with previous coach Kevin Keatts after an inconsistent tenure, highlighted by a Final Four appearance in 2024 but failing to qualify for the ACC Tournament this season. Keatts concluded his Wolfpack tenure with a 151-113 record.\nClemson and McNeese State will face off Thursday afternoon in Providence at 3:15 p.m. ET, airing on TruTV.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
