  "text": "The Kansas City Royals are bringing back powder blue pants in 2025, and this time for more than just a one-game cameo.\nThe Royals recently announced they will pair their powder blue alternate jerseys with matching powder blue pants for every Saturday home game throughout the 2025 season. Previously, the Royals wore white pants with these jerseys, except for the first and final games of the 2023 season.\n“Powder Blues were first introduced in 1973 at the request of Muriel Kauffman,” explained Sarah Tourville, Senior Vice President – Chief Revenue and Innovation Officer for the Royals, in an email to SportsLogos.Net ahead of the 2023 season. At the time, it was the first time the Royals had worn a ‘full’ powder blue uniform in Kansas City, as they had previously been worn exclusively on the road.\nAlongside the powder blue pants is the news they’ll be wearing their batting practice caps with this uniform. The Royals’ BP cap for 2025 is a powder blue crown with a white front panel and royal blue visor. On the front of the cap is the original Kansas City Royals logo, featuring a blue shield in the shape of a home plate with a gold crown above and the team initials of “KCR” on the shield.\nFrom 1973 until 1991, the Royals regularly wore powder blue jerseys and pants during road games. After a hiatus, the powder blue jerseys returned as a home alternate in 2008, but they were always paired with white pants except for the aforementioned two occasions in 2023.\nSeveral prominent players wore the full powder blue look for Kansas City in the ’70s and ’80s, including Hall of Famers George Brett, Gaylord Perry, Harmon Killebrew, and Orlando Cepeda, as well as franchise greats Bret Saberhagen, Kevin Appier, and David Cone. Kansas City was also the last American League team to wear powder blue uniforms regularly on the road, finally switching to traditional grey for the 1992 season, along with the National League’s Montreal Expos.\nFans hoping to see the Powder Blues in person are being offered a special ticket package called the Powder Blue Six-Pack. This package includes tickets to six Powder Blue uniform games and a special bobblehead featuring team captain Salvador Perez wearing the full Powder Blue set.\nThe Royals’ first appearance in the full powder blues in 2025 is set for March 29 against the Cleveland Guardians. Their entire powder blue schedule is below:\n- March 29 vs Cleveland\n- April 5 vs Baltimore\n- April 26 vs Houston\n- May 10 vs Boston\n- May 17 vs St. Louis\n- May 31 vs Detroit\n- June 14 vs Athletics\n- June 29 vs LA Dodgers\n- July 12 vs NY Mets\n- July 26 vs Cleveland\n- August 16 vs Chi White Sox\n- August 30 vs Detroit\n- September 6 vs Minnesota\n- September 20 vs Toronto",
