Jr. Drive and Highland Avenue — just around the corner from Fiserv Forum — is preparing for the long basketball weekend with extra servers.\n\"It's going to be a really fun weekend. We have a lot of people coming in town,\" said Mader's banquet manager, Ben Stilp. \"This event is going to be expecting about 19,000 attendees. There is also a volleyball conference going over at Baird Center. It's going to bring in about 16,000 people, so a lot of people in the area.\"\nStilp said they're also opening their upstairs seating area, which increases the restaurant's capacity from 250 to 350 people.\n\"I think the most exciting part is all of the different people that we're going to be seeing. I mean, the teams are coming from all over the country. It's just a great opportunity to get the German culture out there for people and, of course, a lot of delicious German food.\"\nIf you buy a meal at Mader's, you can access its parking lot. You will have to show your receipt to the valet, and your parking will be covered for your session.",
