  "text": "Trai Hume has backed new arrivals Ronan Hale and Jamie Donley to shine for Northern Ireland.\nRoss County striker Hale recently secured his switch from the Republic of Ireland while Tottenham Hotspur forward Donley has been granted permission from FIFA to make the move from England.\nThe 20-year-old, who hails from Antrim, has represented England and Northern Ireland at underage level and is currently on-loan at Leyton Orient.\nHume says both players have enjoyed seamless transitions and believes their desire to join Northern Ireland is evidence of the country's progress on the pitch.\nHe said: \"It's a chance for them to prove themselves and show their quality at international level. For us, it's a credit to us as a team that they want to come in and be a part of this.\n\"They want to get themselves international caps with us and it's a credit to us as a team and staff that they can see we are trying to progress and move this team forward.\n\"In the last few days in training they have been excellent and training hard.\"\nHale and Donley will hope to earn some game time in the upcoming friendlies against Switzerland and Sweden.\nMichael O'Neill's side host the Swiss on Friday night at Windsor Park before travelling to Sweden next Tuesday.\n\"Hopefully they can get a chance to impress the fans and gaffer in the upcoming games,\" he said.\n\"I played against Ronan before in the Irish League when he was with Larne. I know the quality he has and he has gone to Ross County and scored goals.\n\"It is the same with Jamie on loan at Leyton Orient. He is scoring goals as well and credit to them, they both deserved to be called up and they certainly don't look out of place.\n\"Hopefully Michael can give them a chance and they can show how good they are.\"\n Sign up to our free sports newsletter to get the latest headlines to your inbox",
