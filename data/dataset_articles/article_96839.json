  "text": "WKU Player of the Week: Hilltopper baseball outfielder Ryan Wideman\nBOWLING GREEN, Ky. – Today’s WKU Player of the Week is Hilltopper baseball outfielder Ryan Wideman after the junior transfer had a historic week for the Tops.\nThrough four games, Wideman was 11-for-21 (.524) at the plate with a grand slam, five doubles, two triples and 11 RBI.\nTo top it off, the Georgia native recorded the first cycle in WKU program history in last week’s matchup with Southern Illinois.\nSo far on the season, Wideman is leading the conference in batting average (.459), hits (39), doubles (10), triples (4), RBI (26), total bases (69) and stolen bases (13).\nHis offensive performance also led to him being named the C-USA Hitter of the Week. It was the first time in his career to earn a weekly honor in the league.\nWideman’s efforts at the plate through those games helped the Tops continue on their winning streak as they currently stand at a 19-1 start to the season.",
