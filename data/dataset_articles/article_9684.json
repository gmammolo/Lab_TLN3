  "text": "First discharge from SSGH after Mahi bridge tragedy\nVadodara: Sonal Padhiyar, the woman whose pictures and videos seeking help while standing in the Mahi river went viral after the Gambhira bridge collapse, was the first to be discharged from Sir Sayajirao General Hospital (SSGH). Four other survivors from the incident are still admitted and under treatment at the state-run facility.\nSonal was travelling in a van with her husband, children, and other relatives from Mujpur village in Padra taluka to Bagdana near Bhavnagar when the accident occurred. The bridge collapsed shortly after the vehicle began its journey, leading to the death of her husband Ramesh Padhiyar (38), daughter Vedika (4), son Naitik (2), and three other family members.\nFollowing the incident, five injured were brought to SSGH for treatment. Along with Sonal, the others admitted were Narendrasinh Parmar, Gannpatsinh Rajput, Raju Hathiya, and Dilip Padhiyar.\nAccording to Dr Hitendra Chauhan, in-charge RMO at the hospital, one of the patients underwent surgery on Wednesday while another was scheduled for surgery on Thursday. The condition of the remaining two patients is reported to be stable.",
