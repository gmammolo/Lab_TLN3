  "text": "Scottie Scheffler appreciates his\nTexas roots, if this year's Champions Dinner menu is any indication. And he definitely knows what he likes.\nScheffler is repeating his menu from the Champions Dinner\nat the Masters two years ago. The menu starts with cheeseburger sliders \"served Scottie-style\" and firecracker shrimp with sweet Thai chili sauce and sriracha mayo.\nChampions will also get to savor the flavor of\nTexas-style chili topped with Cheddar cheese and jalapeños, which is a slight change from Scheffler's 2023 soup course, chicken tortilla soup.\nThen guests will have two choices for the main course: a wood-fired\ncowboy ribeye or blackened redfish. Sides lean toward hearty and include mac and cheese and jalapeño creamed corn. The champions will polish off the meal with a warm chocolate-chip skillet cookie and vanilla-bean ice cream.\nThere's one surprise addition this year that doesn't quite fit the Tex-Mex theme: Papa Scheff's Meatball & Ravioli Bites. Scheffler apparently felt obliged to include the recipe after famously cutting open his hand with a wine glass while making homemade ravioli earlier this year, according to\nCBS Sports. Scheffler ending up missing tournaments because of the injury.\nThe\ndefending Masters champion selects the menu for the exclusive, invitation-only dinner each year. We're hoping to see some photos of Scheffler's dishes in April—and that his dinner is an injury-free event.",
