  "text": "BARÇA FEMENÍ\nWolfsburg 1-4 Barça Femení: a thrashing to get closer to the Champions 'semis'\nPublished:19/03/2025 - 23:26h\nUpdated:19/03/2025 - 23:26h\nFC Barcelona Femení took a big step towards the 'semis' of the Champions with a resounding victory in Germany against Wolfsburg (1-4)\nThe UEFA Women's Champions League held its other two first-leg matches of the quarter-finals this Wednesday. FC Barcelona Femení visited the always challenging Wolfsburg, but Pere Romeu's team once again imposed themselves with authority in Germany (1-4) to pave their way to another European semi-final, a stage they have reached in the last six seasons.\nThe azulgranas took possession from the start, but the first quarter of an hour was quite even, with few chances in the areas. In the 25th minute, a cross from Aitana ended in a goal after a failed clearance by Dijkstra, who in her effort to prevent the pass from finding a recipient in a rival ended up sending the ball into her own net. Despite the blow, the locals managed to stay in the game until halftime.\nBarça sealed the match and the tie in the second half\nAfter the break, Wolfsburg pushed forward to seek the equalizer, a factor that the Catalans took advantage of to wreak havoc in the opponent's field. In the 50th minute, Irene Paredes took advantage of a shot from Mapi León that seemed to be going wide to extend the lead. Three minutes later, the sentence would come through Salma Paralluelo, thanks to Aitana's assist.\nWith the score at 0-3, the Germans made substitutions to try to stem the bleeding at the back, while Pere Romeu waited until the 70th minute to bring on Ingrid Engen and Fridolina Rolfö for Salma and Esmee Brugts. The culés took their foot off the gas and Wolfsburg took advantage to score thanks to a header from defender Janina Minge. Immediately after, Sydney Schertenleib came on for Alexia Putellas.\nWith only a couple of minutes on the field, the Swiss player scored the definitive 1-4 taking advantage of a recovery by Aitana, who passed the ball to Rolfö and she to Schertenleib to complete a great collective action. Towards the end, Vicky López and Marta Torrejón would come on for Jana and Aitana, already in stoppage time. The rematch will be next Thursday at the Johan Cruyff Stadium, at 18:45.\nBarça and Lyon, one step away from facing each other in the 'semis'\nThe Barça Femení is aiming for its fourth crown in the Women's Champions League and the third in a row. The Olympique Lyon, the tournament's top winner with 8 titles, won five consecutive editions between 2016 and 2020. This season, the final will be held at the José Alvalade Stadium in Lisbon, on May 24. The French team will almost certainly face the culés in the 'semis', after the 0-2 obtained in the first leg against Bayern Munich.\n⚽First-leg matches of the Champions quarter-finals\n- Real Madrid 2-0 Arsenal, in Madrid.\n- Bayern Munich 0-2 Olympique Lyon, in Munich.\n- Wolfsburg 1-4 FC Barcelona, in Wolfsburg.\n- Manchester City 2-0 Chelsea, in Manchester.\n⚽Second-leg matches of the Champions quarter-finals\n- Olympique Lyon vs Bayern Munich, Wednesday, March 26 in Lyon (18:45 CEST).\n- Arsenal vs Real Madrid, Wednesday, March 26 in London (21:00 CEST).\n- FC Barcelona vs Wolfsburg, Thursday, March 27 in Barcelona (18:45 CEST).\n- Chelsea vs Manchester City, Thursday, March 27 in London (21:00 CEST).\n⚽Semifinals of the UEFA Women's Champions League\n- Madrid/Arsenal vs City/Chelsea (April 19-20 and 26-27).\n- Barça/Wolfsburg vs Bayern/Lyon (April 19-20 to 26-27).",
