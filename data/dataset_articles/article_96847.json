  "text": "Substitute Vivianne Miedema scored a brace as Manchester City inflicted Chelsea's first defeat of the season by beating them 2-0 in their Champions League quarter-final first leg at the Joie Stadium.\nMiedema, having come off the bench for the start of the second half, put City in front on the hour mark, rifling in the rebound when Hannah Hampton tipped Laia Aleixandri's header against the crossbar.\nAnd after Chelsea substitute Johanna Rytting Kaneryd had struck the bar at the other end in the 80th minute, Miedema added her second with two minutes of normal time remaining to give City a two-goal advantage heading into next Thursday's second leg at Stamford Bridge.\nThat match will complete a series of four successive meetings between the sides, which started with Chelsea's 2-1 triumph on Saturday in the League Cup final at Pride Park that gave them their first trophy under boss Sonia Bompastor.\nThey have now suffered a maiden loss of the Frenchwoman's tenure, ending an unbeaten run of 28 games since she took charge last summer - of which 26 were wins - and 31 matches in total.\nCity, meanwhile, have a first win of Nick Cushing's interim tenure after he replaced Gareth Taylor ahead of the quartet of fixtures, which continues with Sunday's Women's Super League clash at the Etihad Stadium.\nIn Wednesday's other quarter-final, reigning champions Barcelona were emphatic 4-1 winners at Wolfsburg at AOK Stadion.\nThe Catalan side led through Caitlin Dijkstra's own goal midway through the first half, before further goals from Spain internationals Irene Paredes and Salma Paralluelo shortly after the interval.\nJanina Minge pulled one back for Wolfsburg with about ten minutes of normal time to go but Sydney Schertenleib reestablished Barcelona's three-goal advantage late on.\nWatch Bulgaria v Republic of Ireland in the UEFA Nations League on Thursday from 7pm on RTÉ2 and RTÉ Player.
