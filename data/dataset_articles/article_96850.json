  "text": "Lebanese forward Karim Rtail has committed to Arkansas basketball coach John Calipari, according to a report from On3.\nAfter playing professionally in Lithuania, he’s expected to join the Razorbacks for the 2025-26 season as a member of the 2025 recruiting class.\nRtail, 6-9 and 207 pounds, picked the Razorbacks over Penn State, SMU and Butler, according to On3.\nHe averaged 8.3 points and 4.5 rebounds while shooting 42.6% from the field, 31.4% from the three-point line and 78.9% from the free throw line in 16.6 minutes per contest for Neptūnas-Akvaservis in the National Basketball League in Lithuania.\nRtail is the fourth member of Arkansas’ 2025 class, joining Isaiah Sealy, Darius Acuff and Meleek Thomas. The spring signing period runs from April 16 to May 25.\nThe Razorbacks are still hoping to land 2025 5-star prospect Nate Ament when he decides between Arkansas, Kentucky, Duke, Tennessee and Louisville on April 1 at the McDonald’s All-American game.",
