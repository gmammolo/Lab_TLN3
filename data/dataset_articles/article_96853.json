  "text": "The Detroit Pistons shook off some frustrating losses with a 46-point blowout win over the New Orleans Pelicans. Now they look to keep the good times rolling against the struggling Miami Heat. The Heat are currently in the midst of an eight-game losing streak. That is not typical of the Erik Spoelstra Heat. They miss Jimmy Butler and the miss someone in the lineup who can be that gravitational force that the other Miami players can orbit around and discover a flow and rhythm within their offense. The Pistons have that in Cade Cunningham. Cade is still playing at an extremely high level, but his shooting has taken a dip lately. It’d be nice to see a few more 3-pointers fall and a nice, efficient night that allowed him to score his 25 points on 14 or fewer shots.\nGame Vitals\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. ET\nWhere: Kaseya Center, Miami, Florida\nWatch: ESPN\nOdds: Pistons -5\nProjected Lineups\nDetroit Pistons (38-31)\nCade Cunningham, Tim Hardaway Jr, Ausar Thompson, Tobias Harris, Jalen Duren\nMiami Heat (29-39)\nTyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Jaime Jaquez Jr., Haywood Highsmith, Bam Adebayo",
