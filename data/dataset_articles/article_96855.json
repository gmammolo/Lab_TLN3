  "text": "TAMPA — Tyler Matzek is back on the mound after an oblique strain surfaced earlier this month.\nThe left-handed reliever threw a bullpen on Monday and plans on throwing another on Thursday. Matzek isn’t sure how many more side sessions he’ll need before facing live hitters, but he called himself “asymptomatic.”\n“I think we’re going to take our time with the progress,” Matzek said. “It’s moving quick in the sense that I’m getting on the mound earlier compared to most obliques. But we don’t want to push it.”\nA non-roster invitee and decorated postseason pitcher with the Braves, Matzek had been impressing the Yankees this spring after Tommy John surgery derailed his 2023 and 2024 campaigns. He looked like a shoo-in for one of the Bombers’ bullpen spots after earning repeated praise from Aaron Boone, but the 34-year-old isn’t expected to be ready for Opening Day.\n“You feel like we got something there,” the manager said after Matzek logged a scoreless inning in his spring debut on Feb. 25. The manager added that Matzek could “absolutely factor in” this season.\n“It’s a great thing to hear,” Matzek said of Boone’s compliments. “When you have your manager backing you like that, it just makes you want to go out there and do even better.”\nMatzek told the Daily News that he has an opt out before spring training ends, as well as a few early on in the regular season. However, he wasn’t sure of the exact dates, and his agent didn’t respond to a request for clarification.\nEven with his injury, he said that his first opt out is still something to consider, though he’d prefer to stay with the Yankees.\n“I think that when I’m healthy, I’m a very productive part of this team and would like to be on this team,” Matzek said. “If it was the only one, I’d consider it more, but I know that I have a few lined up early in the year, so I’d like to try being a Yankee first. If that, for some reason, doesn’t work out, I’ve got some other backup plans.”\nA World Series champion with Atlanta in 2021, Matzek owns a 1.48 ERA over 20 postseason contests. Despite battling the yips early in his career, he’s pitched in 168 big league games, recording a 3.72 ERA. He had a 2.92 ERA over 132 games with the Braves from 2020-2022.\nLeiter Jr. Ready\nMark Leiter, Jr. has been dealing with a minor back issue, but the reliever told the YES Network’s Jack Curry that he threw an 18-pitch live batting practice session on Wednesday.\n“If the season started tomorrow, I’d be ready,” Leiter said.\nLeiter hasn’t pitched in an exhibition game since March 6. The Yankees are hoping he can be a big part of their bullpen this season, though he struggled after being acquired from the Cubs last summer.\nThe righty had a 4.98 ERA over 21 games after the trade, though he added a 1.69 ERA over six postseason appearances.",
