  "text": "NBA Power Rankings: Rockets surge as contenders sort themselves out\nWith less than one month remaining in the NBA regular season, the playoff picture continues taking shape—and so is the separation between contenders and pretenders.\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers have already clinched a postseason berth, and the Oklahoma City Thunder are likely to clinch the first overall seed in the Western Conference soon. Meanwhile, the Boston Celtics remain a force near the top of the Eastern Conference.\nHowever, not all teams are in the same position. Some, like the New Orleans Pelicans and Dallas Mavericks, have become doomed by rampant injuries. Others like the Detroit Pistons are turning heads with a late-season surge toward their first playoff berth since 2019.\nThe Houston Rockets have also surged lately, winning seven straight games to push them back to second overall in the West before Wednesday’s action. However, the Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Lakers, and Memphis Grizzlies all remain within striking distance.\nHere’s the list of all 30 NBA teams in the latest power rankings:\n- Cleveland Cavaliers: 56-12 (+550 odds to win the NBA Finals on\nDraftKings Sportsbook) - Oklahoma City Thunder: 56-12 (+175)\n- Boston Celtics: 50-19 (+225)\n- Denver Nuggets: 42-23 (+1400)\n- New York Knicks: 43-24 (+2000)\n- Los Angeles Lakers: 42-25 (+1500)\n- Memphis Grizzlies: 43-26 (+5500)\n- Golden State Warriors: 49-29 (+1600)\n- Houston Rockets: 44-25 (+15000)\n- Milwaukee Bucks: 38-30 (+5500)\n- Indiana Pacers: 38-29 (+12000)\n- Minnesota Timberwolves: 40-30 (+6000)\n- Los Angeles Clippers: 39-30 (+6000)\n- Detroit Pistons: 38-31 (+40000)\n- Sacramento Kings: 34-33 (+100000)\n- Dallas Mavericks: 33-36 (+400000)\n- Orlando Magic: 32-37 (+80000)\n- Atlanta Hawks: 33-36 (+200000)\n- Miami Heat: 29-39 (+100000)\n- Chicago Bulls: 29-39 (+400000)\n- Phoenix Suns: 32-37 (+100000)\n- Philadelphia 76ers: 23-45 (+500000)\n- San Antonio Spurs: 28-39 (+500000)\n- Portland Trail Blazers: 30-39 (+400000)\n- Toronto Raptors: 24-45 (+500000)\n- Brooklyn Nets: 23-46 (+1000000)\n- Washington Wizards: 15-54\n- Charlotte Hornets: 17-51\n- New Orleans Pelicans: 18-51\n- Utah Jazz: 15-54\nThe Crown Is Yours: Sign up for DraftKings and experience the ultimate host for games and betting experiences!\nAll odds and lines provided by DraftKings Sportsbook and are subject to change.",
