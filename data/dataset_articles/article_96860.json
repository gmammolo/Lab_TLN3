  "text": "PFF lists Cardinals defensive line as 1 of most improved units from NFL free agency\nMar 19, 2025, 3:31 PM\nAs the Arizona Cardinals’ work during NFL free agency winds down, one NFL writer thinks the team has made top progress toward improving one position in particular on the team.\nPFF’s Max Chadwick listed the Cardinals’ defensive line as the most improved position unit from free agency. Chadwick noted the signing of edge rusher Josh Sweat and re-signing of outside linebacker Baron Browning as key additions to a team ranked 28th in the NFL in defensive line play.\nThe Cardinals had the fifth-lowest-graded defensive line in the NFL last season. In response, Arizona invested nearly $125 million in its defensive front.\nThe Cardinals’ biggest addition came by adding edge defender Josh Sweat. He earned 70.0-plus PFF grades in four of the past five seasons and posted 10.5 sacks for the Philadelphia Eagles in the regular season and playoffs last year. They also brought back Baron Browning to man the other edge defender spot, and he ranked 23rd in both pass-rush grade and pass-rush win rate last year.\nSweat registered 41 tackles and eight sacks with the Philadelphia Eagles last season. Sweat had an impressive playoff performance for the Eagles, registering 10 total tackles, including 2.5 sacks in a Super Bowl win against the Kansas City Chiefs.\nChadwick also noted the signing of defensive tackle Dalvin Tomlinson as a key addition to the defensive line. Second-year defensive lineman Darius Robinson was circled as a player to watch in 2025.\nArizona’s major addition at defensive tackle came in the form of Dalvin Tomlinson, who’s been one of the 32 highest-graded interior defenders in seven of his eight seasons. The Cardinals are hoping 2024 first-round pick Darius Robinson can make a jump in Year 2 to solidify one of the other spots on the interior defensive line.\nTomlinson registered 16 tackles with four sacks with the Cleveland Browns and had a 67.4 PFF grade in 2024, 42nd in the NFL. In eight seasons, the 6-foot-3, 325-pound lineman has registered 316 tackles and 16 sacks with the Browns, New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings.\nWhat the Cardinals defensive line looks like following free agency?\nThe Cardinals’ additions of Sweat and Tomlinson look to improve a defense that was 13th in total sacks last season with 41, despite no player on the team having more than outside linebacker Zaven Collins’ five sacks.\nAlong with the additions of Sweat and Tomlinson and re-signing Browning, the Cardinals also brought back L.J. Collier on a one-year deal.\nThe Cardinals lost several defensive players in free agency, including linemen Khyiris Tonga, Roy Lopez and Naquan Jones.\nThe position is looking for better injury luck in 2025 after losing Bilal Nichols and Justin Jones to season-ending injuries, while Darius Robinson missed 11 games due to a calf issue last season.\nThe Cardinals edge-rushing unit was also hit hard by injuries, losing Dennis Gardeck to a season-ending knee injury. Outside linebacker BJ Ojualri missed the entire season due to a knee injury he sustained in training camp.",
