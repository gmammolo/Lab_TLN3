  "text": "WWE Hall of Famer can face John Cena in his retirement match.\n2025 is set to host two big retirement matches already. While John Cena has already begun his retirement tour, and is scheduled to face Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 41, another Hall of Famer is also set to have his retirement match.\nFormer Universal Champion Goldberg is reported to have his retirement match later this year in 2025, although an exact date is not known yet. Goldberg also recently underwent stem cell therapy and is set to resume his training in the next few weeks.\nSpeaking to Ariel Helwani on The Ariel Helwani Show, he opened up on his list of potential retirement opponents. Naming John Cena as a possible foe, the Hall of Famer commented:\n“I never got a chance to get my hand around Cena’s throat. That might have been cool. There are a lot of people I would have loved to have faced back in the day, but the fact is, what does that do for the business now? A lot of people don’t even remember me that watch wrestling right now. A lot of people don’t know me because they speak negatively of me. I think I was an innovator of sorts. There are a plethora (of people).\nI’d love to have a rematch with Roman [Reigns]. There are so many guys that are so talented and on the cusp of stardom if not there yet, that are possibilities. Bron Breakker. It’s a logical solution. It’s all in how the powers that be want to make it happen. We’ll figure it out and hopefully, at the end of the day, I’m able to present myself in a positive manner to where the people of today, who don’t remember me, will sure as frick remember me after they see me my last time, and it won’t be in a negative way.”\nH/t Fightful\nWith The Leader of Cenation fixated on Rhodes, Goldberg recently found himself at the receiving end of some verbal shots by Matt Riddle.\nJohn Cena Has Addressed The Crowd Following His WWE Heel Turn\nAbsent since Elimination Chamber 2025, John Cena appeared on the March 17th episode of Raw in Brussels, Belgium, and addressed the crowd for the first time since his heel turn. Cena stated that his character change stemmed from the audience’s reactions, alleging that he has been the butt of an invisible joke for nearly fifteen years and had been bullied by the crowd into embracing that character. He further emphasized that he is not a heel, but a human being, to whom the fans have been awful.\nIn other news: A WWE star wants a budding AEW star to beat Mercedes Mone.",
