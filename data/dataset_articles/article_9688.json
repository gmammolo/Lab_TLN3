The aircraft and crew will aid search efforts after flash flooding in Texas. (Photo by Spc. Armani Wilson/U.S. Army National Guard) North Dakota National Guard equipment and personnel will assist the search for victims of flash flooding in Texas. North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong authorized the National Guard’s MQ-9 Reaper, a remotely piloted surveillance drone, and its support team to assist in search operations in response to an Emergency Management Assistance Compact request from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. The central Texas floods killed 120 people with more than 170 people still reported as missing, according to the news release. The authorization marks the first time the state’s National Guard unmanned aerial vehicle team has supported a request for assistance through the emergency compact, Armstrong’s office said Thursday. “Other states have come to our aid in extremely challenging times, and North Dakota stands ready to help Texas through this catastrophe however we can,” Armstrong said. The Fargo-based 119th Wing of the North Dakota Air National Guard will remotely pilot the unmanned aircraft from Fargo, said Brig. Gen. Mitchell Johnson, adjutant general of the North Dakota National Guard and director of the Department of Emergency Services.
