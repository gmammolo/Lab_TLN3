  "text": "Chavez surprised by 2016 WNBA MVP Ogwumike with Gatorade Player of Year trophy\nLUBBOCK, Texas (KCBD) - On Wednesday morning, 2016 WNBA MVP and WNBA champion Nneka Ogwumike surprised Monterey’s five-star point guard Aaliyah Chavez with the 2024-25 Gatorade National Girls Basketball Player of the Year award.\nChavez received the award inside the gym at Monterey with her coaches and supporters around.\nOgwumike won the WNBA championship with the Los Angeles Sparks the same year as her MVP season in 2016. She was the first-overall selection in the 2012 WNBA Draft.\nShe was named WNBA Rookie of the Year that season and made the All-Rookie Team. Since then, she’s been named a nine-time WNBA All-Star.\nThe honor goes to the top player in the country and has a longstanding history with some of the biggest names in basketball. Former winners include Juju Watkins, Paige Bueckers and Kiki Rice.\nPast winners also combined for more than nine WNBA MVP awards, 53 All-Star Appearances and 15 WNBA Championships, according to Gatorade. 15 former winners also went on to be first-round draft picks with two becoming hall of famers.\nChavez and the Lady Plainsmen recently clinched the state title. Chavez, the No. 1 prospect in this year’s women’s class, will be making her commitment announcement on Tuesday.\nCopyright 2025 KCBD. All rights reserved.",
