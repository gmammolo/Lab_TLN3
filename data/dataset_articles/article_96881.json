  "text": "For decades, American soccer has resisted a system that is fundamental to the sport worldwide: promotion and relegation. The closed-league model, dominant in Major League Soccer (MLS) and other North American sports leagues, has left clubs with fixed membership and limited opportunities for growth outside of expensive expansion fees. But now, history has been made.\nThe United Soccer League (USL) has officially voted to implement promotion and relegation across its divisions, breaking the mold of American professional sports, The Athletic has confirmed. By 2028, USL clubs will compete in an interconnected three-tier system where teams can rise or fall based on performance, aligning with the global game. It’s a move that could transform the landscape of U.S. soccer. But will the most popular league in the country, MLS, also do this?\nThe USL currently operates two professional leagues: USL Championship (Division 2) and USL League One (Division 3). But in 2027, the league plans to introduce a new Division 1 competition, USL Premier, pending approval from the U.S. Soccer Federation.\nOnce this top-tier league is established, the USL will fully embrace a system where the best-performing teams from lower divisions are promoted and the worst-performing teams from higher divisions are relegated. This means a third-tier club could theoretically climb all the way to the top flight through success on the pitch while underperforming clubs risk dropping to lower levels.\n“A new chapter in American soccer begins,” said Alec Papadakis, CEO of the USL. “Now, just as it is in the global game, more communities in America can aspire to compete at the highest level of soccer. It’s time.” The vote to approve the system was not unanimous, but 90% of USL owners supported the change, believing it would increase competition, attract fans, and boost revenues.\nWill this reshape American soccer?\nThe move has been met with excitement, particularly among those who have long advocated for promotion and relegation in the U.S. Unlike MLS, which has been criticized for “meaningless” regular-season games, the USL believes its new system will add drama and intensity to every match.\nUSL president Paul McDonough highlighted the importance of “games of consequence”, saying: “Fans are drawn to the intensity of high-stakes competition, where more matches have real consequences — just like we see in European leagues.”\nThis merit-based approach could also improve player development. Young talents in smaller markets will now have a clearer path to top-tier competition, providing more incentive for clubs to invest in youth academies.\nCould MLS change its rules as well?\nFor now, MLS remains a closed league with 30 teams, all guaranteed a place in the competition regardless of performance. This system protects billionaire investors and ensures financial stability, but it also limits opportunities for ambitious lower-division clubs.\nUnlike the USL, MLS owners have no incentive to introduce relegation, as it could devalue franchises and disrupt the business model. However, the Major Soccer League will undoubtedly be watching the USL experiment closely. If the new system drives fan engagement, TV ratings, and sponsorship growth, MLS may eventually reconsider its stance.\n“The USL move presents a significant inflection point in the development of pro soccer in the U.S.,” reported Front Office Sports.",
