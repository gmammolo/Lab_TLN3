  "text": "BOL Basketball Show: Alabama gears up for NCAA Tournament run\nMarch Madness has arrived, and Alabama is a No. 2 seed in the 2025 NCAA Tournament.\nThe Crimson Tide traveled to Cleveland, Ohio, on Wednesday, where it will face 15-seed Robert Morris in the first round on Friday, March 21. The matchup will tip off at 11:40 a.m. CT on truTV. The Alabama-Robert Morris winner will move on to the Round of 32 to take on either No. 7-seed Saint Mary’s or 10-seed Vanderbilt on Sunday, March 23 – also in Cleveland.\nThis is Alabama’s 25th NCAA Tournament appearance in program history, with the Tide owning a record of 27-24 (.529). UA is coming off the program’s first-ever Final Four appearance and has made the big dance five consecutive seasons under head coach Nate Oats.\nGet the On3 Top 10 to your inbox every morning\nBy clicking \"Subscribe to Newsletter\", I agree to On3's Privacy Notice, Terms, and use of my personal information described therein.\nAlabama enters the NCAA Tournament after losing to No. 1-seed Florida in the semifinals of the SEC Tournament.
