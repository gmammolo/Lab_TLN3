  "text": "Bronny James and Ben Simmons have something in common.\nFor fans of LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, don't worry — that shouldn't be the case for long.\nBut for a couple nights, the corners of NBA Twitter have laughed at the fact that Bronny and the mostly disappointing Simmons have one statistic in common.\nIn Simmons' NBA career, he has made five 3-pointers. In Bronny's NBA career, he has made five 3-pointers.\nMORE: Is LeBron playing tonight?\nBronny edges Simmons in percentage, having shot 5-for-22 (22.7) compared to Simmons' 5-for-36 (13.9).\nOf course, Bronny should soon surge past Simmons, considering it has taken Bronny 20 NBA games to reach that mark while Simmons' five 3-pointers have come in 373 games.\nSimmons actually hasn't even attempted a 3-pointer in either of the last two seasons.\nBronny is a solid enough long-range shooter in the G League, making 2.9 3-pointers per night on 36 percent shooting.\nAnd no, this stat doesn't really have any bearing on anything. But it's never a bad time to find commonalities between wildly different NBA players who both have their own social media lovers and haters.\nMORE NBA:\n76ers' Quentin Grimes joins two future Hall of Famers on exclusive list Celtics' surprise sharpshooter hits nearly impossible statistical feat Warriors get bad Steph Curry news Kevin Durant's frustrations are mounting LaVar Ball shares on-brand first thoughts since leg amputation",
