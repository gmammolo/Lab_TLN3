  "text": "2018 Boston Marathon champion, fan-favorite Des Linden returns to the course\n'It's always great to be back here'\n'It's always great to be back here'\n'It's always great to be back here'\nDes Linden, who delivered one of the most iconic Boston Marathon finishes in recent history, returned to the iconic course on Wednesday.\n\"It's always great to be back here,\" Linden said as she prepared to put in 20 miles on a route she knows well. \"I feel like there's this sense of hope around the event.\"\nThose hopes were certainly realized in 2018 when Linden became the first American woman in three decades to break the tape and claim the Boston Marathon crown.\nAs she gets ready for another run for Boylston Street, Linden said she's most looking forward to hearing the amazing crowds cheering her on. Pounding that familiar pavement, she said, always helps.\n\"I think getting on the course, feeling the hills and sort of picturing and visualizing what it will be like on race day sort of sets the tone,\" said Linden.\nThis year's Boston Marathon will be run on Monday, April 21.\nWCVB is the exclusive broadcast partner of the marathon and the Boston Athletic Association.",
