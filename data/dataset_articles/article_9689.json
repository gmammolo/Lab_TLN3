  "text": "FORT MYERS, Fla. (WFLA) — A couple and their dog were rescued from their home on Tuesday as it was engulfed in flames. According to the Lee County Sheriff’s Office, deputies arrived at a burning mobile home in North Fort Myers. At the scene, Deputy Gehle Jr. and Deputy Schack discovered that the couple who owned the home, along with their dog, were trapped inside and struggling to escape. The video showed one of the deputies asking a bystander if the house is empty as he runs towards the burning structure. Both officers can then be seen rushing into the house before locating and carrying the couple and their pet out to safety. The Lee County Sheriff’s Office said that the couple was taken to the hospital and treated for non-life-threatening injuries.
