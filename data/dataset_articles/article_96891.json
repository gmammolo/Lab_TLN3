  "text": "Former Saints linebacker Willie Gay Jr. signs with Dolphins\nFormer New Orleans Saints linebacker Willie Gay Jr. is heading to South Florida, signing a one-year deal with the Miami Dolphins after spending the 2024 season in New Orleans. The move for the former Mississippi State standout comes as the Saints continue to reshape their defense with a new coaching staff.\nGay, who signed with the Saints last offseason after four years with the Kansas City Chiefs, played in 15 games for New Orleans in 2024, starting eight. He finished the season with 28 tackles, two sacks, three pass breakups, and a forced fumble. However, a significant hand injury in Week 4 required surgery and forced him to play with a protective club for part of the season.\nThe Saints signed Gay in hopes of adding veteran leadership and championship experience to their linebacker group. He had won two Super Bowls with the Chiefs, becoming an asset due to his speed and versatility.\nNew Orleans will have a new defensive scheme with more 3-4 looks in 2025 under defensive coordinator Brandon Staley. With veterans like Demario Davis and Pete Werner still leading the unit, the team will likely look to the draft or free agency to add depth, speed and pass rush skills at linebacker.\n-\n< PREVReports: Will Wade set to leave McNeese for NC State head coaching role",
