  "text": "Chemsdine Talbi is on cloud nine after receiving his first call-up for Morocco’s senior national team—calling it a “childhood dream come true”.\nThe 19-year-old midfielder couldn’t hide his joy. “I’m extremely happy. My family and everyone congratulated me. It’s a childhood dream come true. I’m thrilled to be here with top players and to represent my national team, Morocco,” Talbi told the official website of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF).\nThe young FC Brugge talent, who has been following the Atlas Lions for years, is eager to integrate into the squad. “I know many players here, and every day I’m getting to know everyone more. I used to watch the national team’s matches, and the infrastructure here is incredible. I’m happy to be part of it,” he added.\nLooking ahead, Talbi has set ambitious goals for his international career. “My ambition is to win as many titles as possible with the national team and make Moroccan fans extremely proud. I thank them for the amazing reception they’ve given me.”\nMorocco has won a tug-of-war with Belgium to secure the budding winger. Talbi played for the Red Devils in the youth setup but switched allegiance to play for Morocco’s senior squad.\nLosing Talbi was not an easy pill to swallow for the Belgium football federation which has piled pressure on football bosses in the country to keep hold of dual-nationality talents.\nKevin Vermeulen, Belgium’s Head of Talent, has been shown the door as a result of this decision amid a major shake-up to the department. Vermeulen, who worked with Talbi at RSC Anderlecht, had tried to lure him to the club but played no part in his final decision to ditch Belgium.\nSports director Vincent Mannaert didn’t hide his frustration. “From now on, we move forward with players who fully commit to Belgium,” he said. “If they choose elsewhere, fine — but we won’t waste time chasing them.”\nTalbi picked Morocco for showing unwavering support during his injury woes – while Belgium dragged its feet. Insiders say Morocco’s thrilling World Cup run and their fierce loyalty to players sealed the deal for him.\nDuring this international break, Talbi is in camp with the Moroccan squad for their upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Niger and Tanzania, scheduled for Friday and Tuesday in Oujda.",
