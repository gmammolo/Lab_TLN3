  "text": "At the tender age of 18, Joao Fonseca has made an impressive splash in the tennis world. Already boasting an ATP Tour title and an impactful Grand Slam debut in Australia under his belt, this world-ranking number 60 player is setting his sights on higher ground. His recent collaboration with acclaimed coach Franco Davin during the Miami Open could signal his intent to ascend further.\nFonseca, who burst onto the tennis scene in 2025 with victories at the Argentina Open and two Challenger titles, now collaborates with Davin, a seasoned mentor known for his guidance of Juan Martin del Potro to the 2009 US Open title. The young Brazilian, currently at a career-high ranking of No. 60, is hoping to leverage Davin’s knowledge to catapult him to the top.\nDavin, originally from Argentina, has been seen practicing with Fonseca’s team at the Miami Open. He was personally hired as a paid consultant by Fonseca’s regular coach, Guilherme Teixeira, following a season of free advice in 2024.\nTeixeira expressed his gratitude for Davin’s involvement, stating, “In 2024, I benefited so much from it, and he offered me everything for free, that I felt a bit awkward”. Fondly referring to his frequent consultation with Davin as ‘bothering’, Teixeira stated that he prefers to pay Davin to ensure that he can continue to seek his advice freely.\nTeixeira emphasized the great synergy between him and Davin, and the importance of respecting Fonseca’s opinions. He noted that Fonseca was very comfortable with the arrangement and that their earlier time together in Miami was both relaxed and productive.\nThis partnership is not a one-off, as Teixeira confirmed that Davin would continue to work with Fonseca beyond the Miami Open. He also mentioned that Davin, a Miami resident, would be joining them in Rio for the clay court season preparations.\nDavin’s impressive resume includes coaching former world No. 3 Del Potro, and guiding him to victory against Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in the 2009 US Open. His portfolio also includes a stint with Grigor Dimitrov and leading Fabio Fognini’s team to a Monte Carlo Masters title.\nFonseca, whose powerful forehand has drawn comparisons to Del Potro, has been praised by former world No. 4 Kei Nishikori, who stated, “I’m very, very curious about him. His forehand speed is excellent. It’s a bit different from Del Potro, but it’s similar.”\nBy winning the title in Phoenix, Fonseca joined the ranks of Del Potro and Guillermo Coria as the third South American player to win three Challengers before the age of 19.\nAs the Miami Open progresses, all eyes will be on the rematch between Fonseca and fellow teen sensation Learner Tien, a replay of the Next Gen ATP Finals final from December, which Fonseca won. With the added mentorship of Davin, Fonseca is poised to make an even bigger impact in the world of tennis.",
