  "text": "STILLWATER, N.Y. — The Stillwater High School varsity girls basketball team isn’t your typical, ‘New kid on the block.’\nYes, the Warriors are making their first appearance in the state Final Four, coming off inaugural Section 2 and Regional crowns. However, their roster is jam-packed with big-game experience, even at the head coaching position.\nWhile that experience hasn’t all come from the hardwood, they’ve been using it for their advantage, penciling in more history along the way.\n“We’ve been there before, and we kind of know what to expect,” Stillwater senior Miranda Price said. “We just can’t put a lot of pressure on ourselves, because that’s what’s gonna end up causing problems out on the court. You just kind of have to go with the flow and play how we have been all season.”\nThe Stillwater High School girls varsity basketball team defeated Greenwich, 49-42, in the Section 2 Class C Championship-Finals, at Hudson Valley Community College, in Troy, N.Y., on Saturday, March 8, 2025. (DREW WEMPLE – MEDIANEWS GROUP) On Thursday, Stillwater meets Section 3’s Cooperstown (21-4) in the NYSPHSAA Class C Semifinals, at Hudson Valley Community College, at 6 p.m. The winner advances to Friday’s championship finals, at 7:45 p.m., in South Troy, to face either Section 6’s Frewsburg or Section 1’s Tuckahoe.\nStillwater may not have any showings in the state finals for girls’ basketball but this past fall, its girls’ varsity soccer team made a run to the NYSPHSAA Class C Championship game for the first time since 2019. Meanwhile, the Stillwater girls varsity volleyball team won its first-ever Section 2 Championship, even reaching the NYSPHSAA Class C Semifinals.\nAccording to head coach Cassidy Chapko, eight of the Warriors’ 11 student-athletes, including Price, had already played deep into the fall calendar with those two other state tournament qualifiers. That, paired with their chemistry around a basketball, has proven to be a winning recipe this winter.\nThe Stillwater High School girls volleyball team defeated Galway, 3-1, in the 2024 Section 2 Class C Championship-Final at Saratoga Springs High School, on Saturday, Nov. 9.

(DREW WEMPLE – MEDIANEWS GROUP).\nExpand “They have big-time experience, experience playing at a higher level, and at the state level, so it’s good that they can share what they have and their knowledge to the other players,” Chapko said. “We’ve kind of been grooming this for the past three years. We are a young team, but most of our starters have been playing together for the past three years, so we knew that this was going to be our year to kind of make a move and make a long run.”\nChapko has known the feeling of hoisting a NYSPHSAA Championship plaque, having claimed the 2012 Class C title with her alma mater, Hoosic Valley during her junior season. She hopes to share that sentiment on Friday night if her team can win two games in two days for the third time this season.\n“She knows how it was. She told us it was one of the best days of her life when she went to school,” said Warriors sophomore forward Andie Luskin, also a standout for Stillwater’s girls varsity volleyball team.\n“She just wants that for us, and she’s doing everything she can to get that for us, so we’re gonna try and do everything we can to get it.”\nThe Stillwater High School girls basketball team defeated Mechanicville, 68-35, on Tuesday, Jan. 21, at Mechanicville Jr./Sr. High School. (DREW WEMPLE – MEDIANEWSGROUP) Over the latest, three-month gauntlet, the Warriors have gone 23-2 overall, and as of Wednesday, were the No. 1 ranked team for Class C in New York State. Although Chapko doesn’t like discussing the weekly polls with her team, keeping them reigned into a fruitful, ‘underdog’ mentality.\n“We don’t really sit down and talk about that stuff. I try not to. It’s just: ‘Do what we have to do, and we have to show up and play,’” Chapko remarked. “Girls’ basketball is a funny game. Sometimes you can look like you know what you’re doing, and then other games, it’s like you don’t. So, anything can happen, especially at this stage and at this time of the year. So we just have to go out and play Stillwater basketball, and we’ll be good.”\nThis season, the Warriors’ brand of basketball has been founded on its man-to-man, defensive principles. Only four times this season have the new, No. 1’s surrendered 45 points or more in a game to opponents and one of those instances was this past Saturday, at SUNY Potsdam, in a tight, 49-45, regional finals victory over Section X’s Lisbon Central. Only twice have the Warriors allowed a team to eclipse the 50-point mark.\n“We just continue to work on it, year after year. A lot of these girls, I’ve really moved up with them since they’ve been in seventh grade,” Chapko said, proudly. “So they know what’s expected of them on the defensive end and we really emphasize it in practice…It’s nice that we really can just focus on one defense and that they’ve bought into learning it and doing it really, really well.”\nThe Stillwater High School girls basketball team defeated Mechanicville, 68-35, on Tuesday, Jan. 21, at Mechanicville Jr./Sr. High School. (DREW WEMPLE – MEDIANEWS GROUP). “We do a lot of stuff to prepare. I mean, we watched film the other day, and now that we all know who we’re going to be guarding, it’s easier to realize what we have to focus on,” Price shared. “And we’ve been going over a lot of sets that (Cooperstown) runs, just preparing ourselves the way that we have all season. We just like to focus and practice hard because if we practice the way that we’re going to play, it will result that way on the floor.”\nThe only times Stillwater gave up more than 50 points in a single game this season resulted in its only losses. Both defeats came against Wasaren League rival Greenwich, each by a margin of exactly 20 points. Naturally, when the foes met again, in the Section 2 Class C Finals at HVCC on March 8, Stillwater pulled out the biggest win of all, eking by, 49-42, for its celebratory title.\n“I think we played to our full potential that night, and we did everything we needed to do very well,” said Luskin. “It really showed all of us how good we really can be, because I don’t think any of us knew it right away.”\nHaving won its last 12 straight games, Stillwater went into its high school gymnasium on Wednesday for its last practice of the season. While Price said she won’t miss the seemingly 20-hour days filled with school, homework, film sessions, and drilling, both she and Luskin will always carry love for what that time went towards.\n“I just feel like with our team, we’re all kind of like a family,” Price said fondly, as one of only two seniors in the Warriors’ locker room. “We always laugh a lot together and we’ve had a lot of fun moments this season.”\nThe Stillwater High School girls basketball team defeated Greenwich, 49-42, in the Section 2 Class C Championship-Finals, at Hudson Valley Community College, in Troy, N.Y., on Saturday, March 8, 2025. (DREW WEMPLE – MEDIANEWS GROUP) “I just try and tell them, ‘to live in the moment, enjoy it, this is something that not a lot of girls experience, and just stay together,” Chapko added. “They may not think it’s a big deal, but 20 years down the line, they’re going to be able to tell their kids one day that they were on the first-ever team to go to the state Final Four, which is pretty impressive… ‘Just enjoy every moment that you have on this ride, because unfortunately, it will come to an end at some point and everyone will go on with their lives, but these memories are going to last a lifetime.’”\nBut outside the school’s walls, the Warriors have embraced this ride with their community. Like how it was a year ago when they were in the gallery to watch the Stillwater boys varsity basketball team win its own NYSPHSAA Class B championship in Glens Falls, the Warriors know that the support their sports teams receive from their small Saratoga County hamlet feels quite large.\nThe Stillwater High School boys varsity basketball defeated Marcellus High School, 59-50, in the NYSPHSAA Class B State Final, at Cool Insuring Arena, in Glens Falls, NY, on Friday, March 15, 2024.

Everybody’s super excited.”",
