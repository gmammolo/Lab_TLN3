  "text": "In a thrilling development, race car driver Robert Wickens has taken his initial spin in the No. 36 Bosch/Mobil1 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 GT3.R, a top-tier sports car managed by DXDT Racing. This test run took place at the globally recognized Sebring International Raceway, laying down the foundation for his thrilling debut race with the team, slated to occur next month in Long Beach.\nThe Corvette Z06 GT3.R, outfitted with the impressively advanced hand-control braking system from Bosch, has left Wickens more than satisfied with his first experience behind its wheel. “I’m adjusting to the Corvette Z06 GT3.R at an impressive pace. It’s an exceptional race car,” Wickens enthused. He went on to commend the Bosch system for its high-level performance. Wickens expressed his exhilaration about the upcoming Long Beach race, attributing his confidence to the robust team supporting him, which includes industry giants such as Bosch, GM, Pratt & Miller, team owner David Askew, and the entire DXDT Racing crew.\nAccompanying Wickens as a co-driver is none other than the two-time GTLM champion, Tommy Milner. Milner, who also had the opportunity to explore the Bosch system during straight-line tests conducted by DXDT in January, expressed his excitement about his involvement in the upcoming race. “I am thrilled to be teaming up with DXDT and Robert at Long Beach. This event offers a fantastic blend of opportunities, such as reuniting with DXDT, assisting Rob in his Corvette debut, and making a return to the Long Beach track,” Milner stated.\nIn November of the previous year, the news broke that Wickens would be participating in the IMSA WeatherTech Championship sprint races this season with DXDT. The first of these races, which will take place at Long Beach, will mark Wickens’ first-ever experience on a street circuit using hand controls.\nWickens, a Canadian, last showcased his skill at Long Beach during his rookie season in IndyCar in 2018. Unfortunately, his promising career was abruptly halted due to severe spinal injuries he sustained in a crash at Pocono. However, Wickens’ tenacity never waned, and he made a promise to return to the racing scene. Following 1258 days of recovery post-accident, Wickens made his comeback in the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge, driving a Bryan Herta Autosport Hyundai, customized with hand controls. Wickens’ triumphant return saw him clinch three MPC titles and the 2023 series title, making him the first-ever driver to secure a significant motorsports title in North America using hand controls.\nIn the previous year, Bosch publicized its partnership with Wickens. This collaboration aimed to design an advanced hand control system, a groundbreaking move that would make it possible for Wickens to return to professional racing at the highest level. This inspirational story of resilience and innovation is a testament to the power of determination and the potential of technology in the world of motorsports.",
