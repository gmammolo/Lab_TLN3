  "text": "Deion Sanders Hires Super Bowl-Winning Coach Byron Leftwich To Colorado Buffaloes Staff\nTwo days after teasing \"huge moves\" would be coming to his coaching staff, Colorado Buffaloes coach Deion Sanders has hired former Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich. Fox Sports NFL insider Jordan Schultz was first to report the hire on Wednesday afternoon.\nLeftwich's official title with the Buffs has yet to be announced, but he'll likely work closely with Colorado offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Pat Shurmur. To speculate, Leftwich would fit in well as an offensive analyst or passing game coordinator.\nAfter playing his college football at Marshall, the quarterback Leftwich was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars with the seventh overall pick in the 2003 NFL draft. Leftwich spent four seasons with Jacksonville (2003-06) before spending time with the Pittsburgh Steelers (2008, 2010-12) and Buccaneers (2009). He was also the backup to quarterback Ben Roethlisberger when the Steelers won Super Bowl XLIII in 2009.\nLeftwich was spotted at Colorado's spring practice on Tuesday but his hiring wasn't yet reported. CU has also yet to make an official announcement.\nThe Arizona Cardinals gave Leftwich his first coaching job in 2016 as a coaching intern specializing in quarterbacks. Leftwich became the Cardinals' quarterbacks coach in 2017 and was an interim offensive coordinator with Arizona for part of the 2018 season.\nIn 2019, Leftwich reunited with coach Bruce Arians when he was named offensive coordinator of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He rose to coaching stardom in Tampa Bay over the next couple of years alongside quarterback Tom Brady, who spent the final three years of his NFL career with Leftwich as his offensive coordinator. Leftwich, Brady and the Buccaneers won Super Bowl LV in 2021.\nMORE: Deion Sanders Wants To Play Bill Belichick, North Carolina In Spring Game\nMORE: Colorado Buffaloes Coach Deion Sanders Teases Huge Hires, Moves\nMORE: Deion Sanders To Hire Former Tom Brady Coach Byron Leftwich To Colorado Staff?\nMORE: How To Watch Big 12 Pro Day: Travis Hunter, Shedeur Sanders, Shilo Sanders\nLeftwich was fired from the Buccaneers in 2023 and hasn't coached in an official capacity until now.\n\"Coach Prime\" hosted Leftwich as a guest during a Colorado preseason practice in 2023.\nAccording to Schultz, Leftwich interviewed for the New England Patriots' head coaching position and the Seattle Seahawks' offensive coordinator job earlier this offseason. Both organizations went in a different direction, allowing Leftwich to join Sanders' coaching staff.\nNow with the Buffs, Leftwich will help oversee an ongoing starting quarterback battle between freshman Julian \"JuJu\" Lewis, Liberty transfer Kaidon Salter and returner Ryan Staub. It'll be especially intriguing to watch Leftwich work with Lewis early in his college football career.\nSanders' Colorado coaching staff becomes even more NFL-laden with Leftwich coming to Boulder. Other notable hires this offseason include Pro Football Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk (running backs coach) and fellow former NFL players Andre Gurode (assistant offensive line coach) and Domata Peko (defensive line coach).\n\"We have a couple more huge moves we'll probably make this week, maybe one next week, that you are going to really appreciate the understanding of how wonderful this staff is,\" Sanders said Monday. \"The staff we already have, and these guys we are bringing in, gives me tremendous comfort.\"",
