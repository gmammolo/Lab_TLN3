  "text": "Roku, the top TV streaming platform in the U.S., is stepping up to the plate just in time for baseball season with a home run acquisition. Starting April 11, 2025, fans can catch “Just a Bit Outside,” a documentary celebrating the unforgettable 1982 Milwaukee Brewers, exclusively on The Roku Channel . The film, available through June 30, dives into the wild ride of a team that came tantalizingly close to World Series glory, capturing the heart of a hardworking city along the way.\nDirected by Sean Hanish, “Just a Bit Outside” tells the story of a scrappy, colorful crew of ballplayers whose camaraderie and grit defined an era. This wasn’t just a team—it was a brotherhood that mirrored the blue-collar spirit of Milwaukee, a bond that’s endured for over four decades. The documentary doesn’t shy away from the highs and lows of that near-championship season, blending nostalgia with raw emotion. Fresh off a successful Midwest theatrical run and a “Best Sports Film” win at the Louisville International Film Festival, it’s earned a rare 100% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes—no small feat.\nFor Roku , snagging this gem is a big win. “The Brewers have a rich history filled with incredible stories, and we’re honored to bring fans an in-depth look at one of the most memorable seasons in baseball,” said David Eilenberg, Head of Content at Roku Media. “We’re excited to partner with Sean Hanish, Kelly Kahl, and the Cannonball team to deliver more premium sports content to our lineup.” It’s a natural fit for The Roku Channel, which has been steadily beefing up its free, ad-supported offerings to keep viewers hooked.Fr\nThe filmmakers couldn’t be happier about the matchup. “Roku’s massive footprint and passion for sports programming make them the perfect partner,” said producer Kelly Kahl. “Their ability to get this film in front of sports fans is unmatched.” Hanish echoed that excitement, adding, “We’re thrilled to premiere so close to opening day when baseball fever is at its peak. Huge thanks to David and the Roku team for championing independent storytelling and making this universally accessible.”\nThe documentary’s roster is stacked with talent both behind and in front of the camera. Alongside Hanish, producers include Kahl, Paul Jaconi-Biery, and editor Tim Calandrello, with Derek Beamer as executive producer. Gorman Thomas, the Brewers’ two-time American League Home Run Champ and ’82 centerfielder, even steps up as an associate producer. Fans will spot legends like Bud Selig, Robin Yount, Rollie Fingers, and Bob Uecker, alongside other key ’82 Brewers like Paul Molitor and Cecil Cooper, bringing authenticity to every frame.\nBest of all, “Just a Bit Outside” is free to stream—no subscription, no sign-up, just pure baseball nostalgia. You can watch it on Roku devices , TheRokuChannel.com , or through apps on Amazon Fire TV, Samsung TVs, Google TV, and more. As opening day looms, this is one story Brewers fans—and baseball lovers everywhere—won’t want to miss.\nPlease follow us on Facebook and X for more news, tips, and reviews.
