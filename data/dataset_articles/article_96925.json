  "text": "Many golfers never hit a hole-in-one, but a one-armed Queenstown man has just picked up his second.\nSouth African Erasmus \"Ras\" Theron, 76, scored a 76 metre hole-in-one last Friday at the Frankton Golf Centre's driving range - a super-sized hole on an old trailer.\nTheron first achieved the feat on Arrowtown's 12th hole when he was 65, 55 years after first taking up the sport.\nThe former right-hander had his right arm amputated when he was 19 after it was badly burnt while he was training to be a fighter pilot - his instructor failed to pull out of a dive.\n\"I was advised I wouldn't be able to do sport again.\"\nMaking Friday's feat even more special is the fact that he is still recovering from shoulder surgery.\n\"I don't go the distance any more, but I did hit a perfect shot.\n\"Holes-in-one are unbelievable. You know some golfers play their whole life and don't get one.\"\nTheron gained his private pilot's licence in 1990 and has flown three modified types of aircraft with one arm.\nThis story was first published by the Otago Daily Times.",
