  "text": "Former champions Akwa United, Rivers United, Bendel Insurance and Enyimba Wednesday advanced to the Round of 32 of the President’s Federation Cup played across various venues in the country.\nThe Round of 64 matches, which started on Tuesday, continued with no noticeable upset usually associated with the FA Cup.\nBendel Insurance, winners of the cup in 2023, thumped Dandidi Babes 5-0 to reach the next round. Similarly, Enyimba also whitewashed El-Shama 5-0 at the Lafia Township Stadium. Ekene Awazie (brace), Mujeeb Odufeso, and Chidiebere Nnachi (brace) scored in the one-sided encounter.\nIn Abuja, Rivers United edged Barau FC 2-1 to reach the next round, while 2017 winners Akwa United also beat Kebbi United by the same scoreline at the Bwari Township Stadium.\nAnother NPFL side Sunshine Stars also beat Bako FC 2-0 to secure their place in the next round of the competition. Similarly, Lobi Stars claimed a 2-0 win over Discovery Talent to progress to Round of 32.\nKatsina United edged Green Beret 1-0 at the Sani Abacha Stadium in Kano, FC Basira breezed past Atlantic FA 5-0, and former finalists Nasarawa United beat Flight FC 2-0.\nDefending champions Elkanemi Warriors also edged Simon Ben FC 3-2 in a tight affair to march on.\nMatches involving Shooting Stars and Bayelsa were not played after their opponents EFCC and Zamfara United failed to show up. The two sides have now moved into the next round without kicking a ball.",
