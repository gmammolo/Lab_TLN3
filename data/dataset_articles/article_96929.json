  "text": "So far in the 2025 NASCAR season, along with navigating complex legal landscapes,\nMichael Jordan’s 23XI Racing team is also making headlines for securing notable sponsorships.\nRecently, 23XI Racing revealed the new look for their No. 35 car driven by Riley Herbst. In a post on X, they said, “Just smile and wave. The No. 35 LUCY Breakers Toyota Camry XSE will hit the track for the first time in Martinsville.” The post also included an image of the car’s new paint scheme with the LUCY Breakers logo. As per the post, the new look for the No.35 car will have its on-track debut for the first time at the Martinsville speedway.\nNASCAR Fans Share Their Thoughts on the New Look\nAs of November 2024, 23XI Racing announced the expansion to a third full-time NASCAR Cup Series car, the No. 35 Toyota Camry XSE, driven by Herbst and primarily sponsored by Monster Energy. With the new announcement, NASCAR fans can expect to see the No. 35 car debut its new look by the end of March.\nJust smile and wave 👋\nThe No. 35 LUCY Breakers Toyota Camry XSE will be hitting the track for the first time in Martinsville.\n[pic.twitter.com/AC3Bj0UxjA]— 23XI Racing (@23XIRacing)\n[March 19, 2025]\nReacting to the post, one fan said, “Good lookin’ ride there, and harkens back to the old Copenhagen/Skoal days with tobacco cars.”\nAnother fan chipped in, “Nice paint scheme.”\n“Good looking scheme!” added another fan.\n23XI Racing Expanded to Third Full-Time Car\nIn 2024, 23XI Racing announced the addition of a third NASCAR Cup Series car. Herbst, 25, will pilot the No. 35 Toyota, joining the team alongside Tyler Reddick and Bubba Wallace in the third car as 23XI expands operations.\nHerbst said, “It’s an honor to join 23XI and Toyota for the opportunity to race in the Cup Series each week. Racing full-time in the Cup Series has been my goal since I started in NASCAR, and I’m excited to start my Cup career with such an accomplished and driven team.”\n“What 23XI has accomplished in a short time is impressive, and I look forward to building on their success as the organization grows. It’s also great to continue representing Monster, and I’m excited about adding to their legacy in NASCAR.”\nSo far, Monster Energy, a longtime partner with Herbst, has been the primary sponsor of the No. 35 Toyota Camry. However, with 23XI Racing’s latest announcement on X, fans can expect to see the new paint scheme and sponsorship announced soon.\nBefore 23XI Racing, Herbst made eight Cup Series starts with Rick Ware Racing and Front Row Motorsports. In the fall of 2023, he scored a career-high ninth-place result at the Talladega Superspeedway.",
