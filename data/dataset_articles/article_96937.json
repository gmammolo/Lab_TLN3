  "text": "Red Sox reliever Liam Hendriks is ready to open his checkbook if the 2025 Red Sox end up winning a World Series this October.\nThe 36-year-old righty was candid when asked during NESN’s “Unobstructed Views” broadcast of the Bruins/Sabres game about what he plans to do if Boston wins another Fall Classic.\n“I’ve already got permission from my wife. If we [win] it, I’m doing the Jake Peavy thing. I’m buying the damn duck boat,” Hendriks told former Bruins Patrice Bergeron, Tuukka Rask, and Andrew Raycroft during Monday’s broadcast. “I don’t think it will fit in my parking spot in Beacon Hill, though.”\nLiam Hendriks has already planned for the Sox winning it all ⬇️\n\"If we do it, I'm doing the Jake Peavy thing, I'm buying the damn duck boat.\" 🤣 #NESNViews | 🤝 @CoorsBanquet pic.twitter.com/WkzLf3RX98\n— NESN (@NESN) March 18, 2025 Peavy — who won a World Series title as a veteran starter on Boston’s 2013 roster — infamously shelled out $75,000 to purchase his own amphibious vehicle as a keepsake from Boston’s improbable championship run.\nWhile Peavy acknowledged on MLB Network in January 2022 that the duck boat is now a “centerpiece” to a wiffle ball field in his hometown of Mobile, Alabama, the former Cy Young Award winner admitted that the initial reason why he purchased the vehicle was to accommodate his entire family ahead of Boston’s World Series parade.\nRemember when @JakePeavy_22 bought the duck boat his family rode on during the @RedSox 2013 World Series parade?\nHe still has it and there's an epic backstory 🦆 pic.twitter.com/K6eRjNQ3At\n— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) January 21, 2022 “I had a bunch of kids already at the time, I had my wife’s brothers, and I got there that morning and … me and Jon Lester were there together and we had six tickets apiece,” Peavy said. “I said, ‘Look, I can’t wave to my grandparents on the side of this four-hour ride. They’ve got to get on the boat.'”\nHendriks, who is looking to earn a high-leverage spot in Boston’s bullpen while recovering from Tommy John surgery, could be a key reason why the Red Sox put themselves in the running for a deep playoff push this fall.\nWhile Hendriks has had an up-and-down spring training so far, the three-time All-Star does have 116 career saves on his resume and could complement a Red Sox bullpen that also features Justin Slaten and Aroldis Chapman.\n“We’ve got some arms who could be pretty special,” Hendriks told Peter Abraham of The Boston Globe of Boston’s bullpen in February. “It’s a good group and I’m excited to be out there with guys like Aroldis and Justin. I think we’ll be surprisingly good. We have good balance.”\nSign up for the Today newsletter Get everything you need to know to start your day, delivered right to your inbox every morning.\nSubmit your email Enter your email address\nSign up",
