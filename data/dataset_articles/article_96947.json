With this victory, the RedHawks improved to a 13-15 season record, maintaining a perfect 3-0 in the Mid-American Conference (MAC). The Flyers, meanwhile, dropped to 12-10, also at 3-0 in the Atlantic 10 (A-10).\n- Chloe Parks went 3-for-4 at the plate and had 4 RBIs.\n- Mckenna Campbell was 3-for-3 with 2 runs scored.\n- Miami had a lead of 6-0 midway through the game.\nDespite their strong start, Miami allowed Dayton to tie the game, showcasing concerns about maintaining leads late in games.
