  "text": "Sports\nCaitlin Clark’s Video With New Teammate is Turning Heads\nThe WNBA is just two months away from the start of its 2025 season, so naturally, teams and their players are starting to get back to work. The Indiana Fever are no exception, especially since they brought in a lot of new faces to improve their roster.\nWhat turned a lot of heads on Wednesday, however, was the Fever's latest post featuring their new player in Brianna Turner and second-year guard Caitlin Clark.\nAfter officially introducing Turner as a member of the Fever, the defensive star apparently had a workout with Clark.\nThe Fever shared a video showing some of the highlights from their practice session together, including Clark dishing out a perfect assist to Turner for a layup.\nSure enough, fans loved how the two quickly got to work. The video also further intensified the excitement that fans feel for the new season.\n\"Oh yes we getting that [ship] this season! Go Fever!\" a commenter wrote. Another one said, \"Omg someone is actually setting a pick for CC?? Yall … it's over for the league.\"\nA fan added, \"Awesome happy to see Caitlin.\"\n\"Lab work. Turner is much more athletic then we think. Girl can block shots! And very nice catching ally ooooops,\" a commenter shared.\nA fifth supporter claimed, \"We winning it all this year.\"\n\"Let's go! So pump can't wait to have everyone back in Indy,\" a follower excitedly said.\nWNBA training camp begins on April 27, while the 2025 regular season kicks off on May 16. With that said, the wait shouldn't be too long for Fever fans to see Caitlin Clark work fully with her new teammates.\nAside from Turner, the Fever also added Sydney Colson, Natasha Howard, DeWanna Bonner, Jaelyn Brown and Sophie Cunningham this offseason.\nIndeed, it will be interesting to see Clark play with her new teammates and how the Fever's improved roster will help the team.\nRelated: New ‘Insane' Caitlin Clark Stat Has WNBA Fans at Each Other's Throats\nCopyright 2025 The Arena Group, Inc.
