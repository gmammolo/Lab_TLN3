  "text": "Sports\nDetroit Lions Re-Signing Backup Pass Rusher to One-Year Deal\nThe Detroit Lions did their best to make due during an injury plagued 2024-2025 campaign that saw them limp to the finish line without key defenders Aidan Hutchinson, DJ Reader, Alim McNeill, Amik Robertson and others.\nDeparted coach Aaron Glenn's defense surprised many with big plays from unexpected players including backups they picked off the waiver wire and trade acquisitions including Za'Darius Smith, who was recently released by the team.\nOn Thursday, the Lions' latest defensive decision was announced by veteran NFL reporter Adam Schefter, who updated fans about the latest situation regarding one of the 2024 Detroit defense's biggest unsung heroes.\n\"(The) Lions are re-signing defensive end Al-Quadin Muhammad to a one-year deal, per agents Drew Rosenhaus and Robert Bailey,\" Schefter wrote on X.\nMuhammad is listed as the primary backup on the Lions' depth chart to Aidan Hutchinson headed toward the 2025 fall football season at defensive end.\nThe former Miami Hurricane has the flexibility to play rush linebacker in new defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard's scheme in Motown as well.\nHe recorded eight solo tackles and three sacks last season with the Lions, playing in nine games for Aaron Glenn's Detroit defense in helping to lead Detroit to a 15-2 record and the top seed in the National Football Conference.\nRelated: Report: Lions Have 'very strong interest' in UCLA Edge Prospect\nCopyright 2025 The Arena Group, Inc.
