  "text": "Click hereto join\nExpress Pune WhatsApp channeland get a curated list of our stories\nPune district has recorded more than twice its normal rainfall since the start of the monsoon, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) noting 449 mm of rain so far against a normal of 275.1 mm. July too has begun on a good note, with 117.6 mm of rain reported so far, as compared to the normal of 83 mm for the month.\nA key feature of this month’s showers is the near-continuous rainfall, with relatively few instances of intense, heavy, or very heavy spells. As per IMD parameters, heavy rainfall is defined as 64.5–115.5 mm in 24 hours, while very heavy rainfall ranges from 115.6–204.4 mm. An intense spell is one where 90 per cent of the day’s rain falls within an hour.\nThe consistent rains have helped improve water storage in dams across the district. Pavana dam, which supplies water to Pimpri-Chinchwad, is now at 67.67 per cent of its capacity, up sharply from 20.30 per cent this time last year. Khadakwasla is at 56.82 per cent (53.15 per cent last year), Panshet at 68.63 per cent (31.31), Warasgaon at 73.52 per cent (19.14), and Temghar at 61.96 per cent (18.56).\nOverall, the 22 dams in Pune district are now at 87.38 per cent of their collective capacity, compared to 76.83 per cent last year.\nWith rising storage, controlled discharge has begun into several rivers, including the Pavana, Mutha, and Indrayani, contributing to higher water levels downstream at Ujjani dam.",
