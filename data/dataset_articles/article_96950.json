  "text": "This article was a winner of Lookout’s 2025 Journalism Scholarship Challenge, which invited high school students to highlight an unsung hero in their life. Learn more and find all of the winners here.\nHe champions. He empowers. He listens. He shows up.\nHe is there for every student, every athlete, every workout, race, game, musical and theatrical performance.\nHis welcoming presence, supportive spirit and quiet influence speak volumes about the person he truly is.\nPeople become so mesmerized by the grand gesture and so enveloped by loudness or boldness that it is easy to overlook the quiet forces that bring about significant change. These are the unsung heroes in our community who work tirelessly to improve the lives of others without recognition.\nCoach Todd Hoffman is that type of hero. His selflessness and humility keep him from stepping into the spotlight, but those whom his light touches are forever grateful.\n“We lift each other up. That’s who we are.” These words from Todd, head coach of Scotts Valley High School’s cross-country and track & field Teams, are not empty phrases, they are the bedrock upon which his teams are fortified. So much so that this year’s cross-country captains had it printed on the teams’ shirts.\nHis words are not just reserved for his athletes; they are the words he lives by. Todd’s counsel is sought out by students from all across campus. His authenticity, coupled with his way of not just hearing but listening to others, helps students work through struggles and boost confidence.\nAs one of his athletes, I know first-hand how challenging the sport can be. It takes dedication, tenacity and focus. But the role of coach is much harder. As our coach, Todd simultaneously balances workouts, injuries, goals and mindsets for over 30 runners. He is the champion of our dreams, the cheering squad at each success and the support system at every setback. He has taught me to not only trust the process, but trust myself, a gift of confidence I will not soon forget.\nIn addition to volunteering his time as head coach of two sports teams, Todd is a driving force in generating funding for all sports programs, for better facilities, for injury prevention lectures and for opportunities for athletes. He is a constant presence at all sporting events – often found sitting in the bleachers of basketball games, in the stands for football games, or on the start line for running events. Unbeknownst to many, Todd is there before the teams take the field or court, setting up the sound system or staying late to help put things away.\nA long-standing board member of the Falcon Club, the SVHS Parent Club and the recently formed SVHS 25th Anniversary Committee, Todd is a fierce advocate for funding opportunities, like Measure O.\nTodd Hoffman and the track. Credit: Dylan Turzak Beyond athletics, Todd is an integral part of SVHS’ drama department. From the start of each production to the final curtain call, Todd is there to help the actors become their best selves and lean into their roles. He is considered the “theater angel” to many of the drama students. Todd stays late for auditions and rehearsals, helping actors run lines until late in the day. He helps actors with blocking while boosting their confidence and settling nerves, all while assisting with other miscellaneous tasks such as lighting and set building. His presence in the theater is enough to provide a sense of calm and support.\nTodd has changed my life for the better. He helped me surpass my athletic goals and strive for new ones all while being plagued by injuries and moments of intense self-doubt. He had confidence in me even when I didn’t have any in myself. It is his superpower; a way of letting you walk away feeling better than when you walked in.\nAnd he always seems to have time for each of us who need him, even if it is just to rant about a tough day.\nTrack captain Rayne Leonetti recently said that she “can always expect Todd to bring me out of my head — help me make my anxious and obsessive thoughts fizzle out. That’s what he does, he’s a listener, a true listener, and he always seems to know what to do to help in just the way you need, whether it’s saying something you wanted to hear or something that pushes you in the way you need. He is more than just a coach, he knows how to connect with you, he knows how to push you, how to support you.”\nAs we honor all of the unsung or quietly sung heroes who shape our community, let’s celebrate Coach Todd, a silent guardian and confidant. His service to not only Scotts Valley High School, but to the greater community, is a reminder that heroism comes from the commitment to stepping up to make a difference, no matter how unnoticed or celebrated.",
