  "text": "Sports\nTravis Kelce And Taylor Swift Get NBA Invitation From Hollywood Megastar\nWe often see athletes go and watch other sports in their downtime and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have received an invitation that will be hard to turn down.\nWith the NFL offseason in full swing, players have ample time to explore the world and go and watch other sports, with the NBA a big ticket item for some NFL players, including Kelce.\nWe imagine that he and Swift wouldn't have any trouble getting into an NBA game courtside, as we often see Hollywood A-listers at various games, most notably the Los Angeles Lakers.\nAnd now, Kelce and Swift have gotten an invitation from actor and director Ben Stiller, who was a guest on the New Heights podcast and a die-hard New York Knicks fan, after he revealed that he had a rather nice time with Swift at a game previously.\nAnd Kelce thinks now is the time to go to a game with Taylor.\n\"Maybe we can get Taylor to another Knicks game,\" Kelce said.\nRelated: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Defining What 'Laying Low' Means To No. 1 Celeb Couple\nAnd Stiller, the clever talent (he's the brains behind the monster TV hit \"Severance'') and comedian he is, made a rather light-hearted joke about the pair going to Madison Square Garden.\n\"Yeah, this is the time,\" Stiller said on going to a game. \"You should definitely come though. I can hook that up. I'm sure you would need help getting in.\"\nSo Kelce and Swift now have the option to go to a Knicks game with Stiller, and we imagine that much like it is at Arrowhead, Swift would get quite the response if she was sitting courtside at a Knicks game.\nRelated: Insider Reveals Juicy Details Of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's Offseason\nCopyright 2025 The Arena Group, Inc.
