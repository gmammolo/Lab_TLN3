  "text": "The message from the large group of protesters in front of the Warren office of the U.S. Rep. John James Wednesday afternoon was keep your hands off Medicaid.\nThe rally was organized by SEIU Healthcare union and included other advocate partners including Michigan AFL-CIO, Detroit Action, and Michigan United. James (R-Shelby Twp.) has supported the Republican budget resolution that could cut $880 billion from Medicaid.\nMany attendees had personal experience with Medicaid and emphasized the wide array of services it provides, particularly long-term care for disabled, elderly, and mentally-impaired people.\nHome care workers from SEIU healthcare workers union were joined by others protesting proposed cuts to Medicaid in front of U.S. Rep. John James’ Warren office.(PHOTO BY SUSAN SMILEY) Kaitlyn Williams has a three-year-old son who is disabled and requires a prescription formula that she said would cost $400 a month out of pocket if Medicaid was not available to her.\n“He has had six surgeries, he has a shunt, he has a G-tube so it is more than just the formula, too,” Williams said as she stood on Van Dyke Avenue with a sign stating that Medicaid saves lives.\nFor retired auto worker Ted Scancella, Medicaid represents long-term nursing home care for his mother, who died a couple of years ago.\n“My mom was in a nursing home facility toward the end of her life and that was partially covered by Medicaid,” said Scancella. “It doesn’t affect me personally right now, but it could in the future.\n“They keep clawing away at everything so you never know.”\nKatrina Manetta, who co-chairs Macomb Defenders Rising, attended the rally she hopes will raise awareness of the variety of healthcare services that would not be available to citizens if not for Medicaid.\n“We are out here fighting to make sure that the community is protected,” said Manetta. “People are terrified of how they and their families will be impacted by the cuts.”\nManetta said many people may not realize the essential services for which Medicaid provides. Her mentally-disabled aunt relies on Medicaid for her long-term care and has spoken to many parents of disabled children who say they could not afford medical care for them without Medicaid.\nA rally in support of Medicaid held in front of U. S. Rep. John James’ Warren office was well attended with many people expressing anger over proposed cuts to the program.(PHOTO BY SUSAN SMILEY) She also said people with low income jobs that do not offer healthcare, particularly those who need multiple medications, also need Medicaid.\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Detroit Democrat whose district stretches from southern Oakland to the Dearborn and Downriver area, was on hand and urged James to vote in support of Medicaid and against proposed cuts.\n“Prenatal care, mental health care, long-term care; there are so many essential services covered by Medicaid,” said Tlaib. “John James knows what he is doing, and I’m asking him to change his mind and not to cut Medicaid.”\nSEIU Deputy Trustee Gabby Jones-Casey said the lives of healthcare workers and the lives of citizens are on the line, so it is important to create awareness of the impact proposed cuts to Medicaid would have.\n“Medicaid covers a lot of things that people do not even think about,” said Jones-Casey. “It funds a lot of our rural hospitals, it almost completely funds home care, and it gives resources to a lot of the people who are the most vulnerable,” said Jones-Casey.\nJones-Casey said the need for home health care is growing and thus, so is the need for Medicaid.\n“We should actually be talking about expanding the program, because of how impactful, positive and important it is to our community,” said Jones-Casey. “We are going to be out here doing whatever it takes to protect Medicaid.”\nJames did not immediately respond to a Macomb Daily request for comment.",
