  "text": "Naomi Osaka ended her winless drought since the Australian Open at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Open. The Japanese star survived a first-round scare after coming from behind to beat Ukrainian qualifier Yuliia Starodubtseva in the first round.\nOsaka, who was the runners-up in the 2022 Miami Open, returned from injury to compete in the Sunshine Double. The former World No.1 suffered an abdominal injury which forced her to retire during her third-round match against Belinda Bencic. However, two weeks ago, she lost to Camila Osorio in the first round in Indian Wells.\nShe was aiming to bounce back in Miami after beginning the season by reaching the final of the Auckland Classics in the first week of the year. Despite the setback early into her first round tie, she bounced back in time to beat Starodubtseva 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 in 2 hours and 28 minutes in the Florida-based tournament.\nAfter the match, she was asked if she could go further to winning more matches and perhaps winning the title. The Japanese star said that she was ready to play the big stars in the circuit at the tournament.\nI want to play with the big dogs so bad, and I just see everyone playing so well, and I want to do the same. But I have to remember it’s a process.\nNaomi Osaka said via[WTA]\nOsaka now has an opportunity to extend her run at the Miami Open as she faces Liudmila Samsonova in the second round. Samsonova reached the quarterfinals of Indian Wells and earned her biggest win of the season by beating Jasmine Paolini in the fourth round.\nNaomi Osaka began her opening round match very poorly as she was down 3-6, 2-4 against Yuliia Starodubtseva at the Miami Open. The Japanese star had to win four consecutive match points to beat the Ukrainian qualifier in the second set and then complete the turnaround in the third. She later revealed that her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, was behind her comeback.\nI knew that I wasn’t playing too well, but I thought, let me try to stay on the court as long as possible, because I consider Miami my home. When I reach maximum concentration, I completely forget what’s happening in the match; I’m in a bubble. My coach told me that I saved a break point when I was 2-5 down in the second set, and I had no idea. I try to play each point as if it’s the most important of the match when I’m in that state.\nNaomi Osaka said\nOsaka would take the hard lessons of her performance into the second round. The Japanese star was lucky that she was up against an inexperienced qualifier in the opening match, as a top player would never give her any chance for a comeback.\nNaomi Osaka will be hoping to get into the latter stages of the Miami Open for the first time since 2022. The former World No.1 will take on Liudmila Samsonova in the second round, and if she does beat the Russian star, she will face 12th seed Daria Kasatkina in the third round of the WTA 1000 tournament.\nWith a win over Kasatkina, she will likely play either Ons Jabeur or Jasmine Paolini in the fourth round. A possible meeting with Coco Gauff awaits Osaka in the quarter-finals if she gets through.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
