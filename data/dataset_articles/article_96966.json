  "text": "Former WVU head coach named as new IU men’s basketball coach\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - Wednesday, Indiana University announced that former West Virginia head coach Darian DeVries will now roam the sidelines in Bloomington.\nDeVries began his head coaching career at Drake in 2019, where he served for five years before taking over at West Virginia last season. Over his coaching career, DeVries’ teams won 71% of their games, despite the Mountaineers being snubbed from this year’s NCAA Tournament.\nDeVries will be the 31st head coach in IU men’s basketball history and he said he has a vision for moving the program forward.\n“We want to build something that is sustainable for a long period of time and we will do that by staying true to what this program is about,” he said. “We will know when we have made it when every time a fan, a booster, an alumni or a former player comes to watch us play and turns on the TV and after the game is over, that they are filled with pride because they have so much respect for how our team plays, how unselfish they are, they joy they play with and the enthusiasm they play with and their love for this university.”\nDeVries will look to help IU return to its championship-level ways. They haven’t won a National Title since 1987.\nCopyright 2025 WAVE. All rights reserved.",
