  "text": "Nicolas Kühn, a once-promising young talent in German football, has found his stride at Celtic FC. Despite a rocky path marked by challenges and setbacks, including a recent Old Firm derby defeat, he reflects on his journey with optimism. Now a key player, he has scored 18 goals this season, helping the team aim for their 55th championship title. His resilience and dedication showcase a passion for the game, highlighting his evolution from a child prodigy to a star in Glasgow.\nNicolas Kühn: From a Young Prodigy to Celtic Star Nicolas Kühn has long been recognized as a promising talent in Germany since his childhood. However, his journey has not always unfolded as expected. Now thriving at Celtic, Kühn shares his experiences, aspirations, and dreams in a recent interview.\nOn New Year’s Day, Kühn celebrated his birthday surrounded by family. However, he prefers not to dwell on the following day. It wasn’t about the presents or drinks, as he abstains from alcohol. Instead, January 2nd marked a disappointing moment for Kühn and his team, Celtic Glasgow, as they faced a 0-3 defeat to their fierce rivals, the Rangers.\nIn the aftermath of the match, television cameras captured the jubilant celebration of thousands of Rangers supporters clad in their blue gear. In stark contrast, Kühn donned a green-and-white Celtic jersey with the number ten, standing silently among his fellow fans who also refrained from cheering.\nThe Intensity of the Old Firm Rivalry As the rematch against the Rangers approaches on March 16th, 2025, Kühn, now 25, reflects on his initial loss in the historic Old Firm derby, a rivalry steeped in more than just football. He acknowledges the significance of this match, which embodies deep-rooted religious and political tensions between the two clubs. “Every derby is incredible,” he remarks, eagerly anticipating the next encounter.\nKühn joined Celtic in January 2024 from Rapid Vienna, and the meaning of an Old Firm match was clear to him from the start. Prior to the recent loss, he had faced the Rangers five times without defeat, contributing to his team’s collection of three titles during his time there. With a 16-point lead over the Rangers and only three games left in the regular season, Celtic is poised to claim yet another championship.\nCeltic fans are dreaming of the coveted 55th championship title, and Kühn is playing a pivotal role in that ambition. This season, he has netted 18 goals and provided 13 assists across 41 competitive matches. The fans have even crafted a song in his honor, celebrating his dynamic play and goal-scoring ability.\nWith a playing style reminiscent of football great Arjen Robben, Kühn’s movements on the pitch have become a nightmare for opposing defenders. His agility and precision are key elements that have contributed to his growing reputation.\nOnce heralded as a child prodigy, Kühn’s path to success wasn’t straightforward. Starting at a young age, he transitioned from a local club in Lower Saxony to FC St. Pauli, then Hannover 96, and eventually RB Leipzig, where he caught the eye of renowned coach Ralf Rangnick. Despite early accolades, including the prestigious ‘Fritz-Walter-Medaille,’ his journey included challenges at Leipzig and Ajax, where he struggled for playing time.\nAfter a challenging period that included personal loss and injuries, Kühn found his footing during a loan spell at Erzgebirge Aue, where he made a significant impact in the 2. Bundesliga. His successful stint there paved the way for his move to Rapid Vienna, and ultimately, to the illustrious Celtic FC.\nNow, nestled in the heart of Glasgow, Kühn has embraced his role as a key player, often opting for a hat while shopping to maintain a low profile as he navigates the adoring fanbase. Yet, on the pitch, he leaves no room for modesty, especially during his performances in the Champions League, where he showcased his talent against former club Leipzig, scoring two goals.\n“Those were beautiful moments,” Kühn reflects. His story is one of resilience and passion for the beautiful game, proving that with perseverance, dreams can indeed be realized.",
