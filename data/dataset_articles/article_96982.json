  "text": "At Licensing International’s recent summit in NYC, SFIA Senior Director of Business Operations and Research Alex Kerman offered a number of predictions as an addendum to the organization’s industry-standard participation data.\nSFIA’s crystal ball forecast the following:\n- With growing support from the NFL and participation in the 2028 L.A. Olympics as accelerators, flag football (especially girls) is the fastest-growing high school sport, with championships across all 50 states (33 will have them in 2025; 13 has them last year). There is also the eventual status as an NCAA sport. “We’re very bullish, and there’s lots of investment coming,” said Kerman. “For tackle football, the vast majority of participants in high school are boys. For flag, the vast majority in high school are girls.”\n- “The 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Olympics will boost U.S. sports participation and [sports] business growth,” Kerman said.\n- The fastest growing sports overall (see chart) were led by pickleball, which has grown an astounding 311% over the past three years, and is growing across all age groups and is “not just a fad, but a lifetime sport,” according to Kerman. However, racket sports in general are healthy, with tennis (No. 7) and padel are also picking up speed, and overall racquet sports up a leading 9.4%. “We’re bullish on padel becoming the fastest growing sport overall in three to five years.”\n- Pro leagues in women’s softball, volleyball, lacrosse and hockey will drive grassroots participation, as will the six sports to be introduced/reintroduced in the 2028 Olympics -- baseball, cricket, flag football, lacrosse, softball and squash.\nKerman added that tariffs’ impact on sports participation will likely be uneven. The “high equipment costs will impact participation unevenly,” he said.",
