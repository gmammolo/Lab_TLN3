  "text": "PROMO: Join BeaversEdge.com and get 30 DAYS FREE!\nOn Sunday, Oregon State landed their fourth commitment of the 2026 recruiting cycle when three-star wide receiver Cynai Thomas made his decision. Below, BeaversEdge provides five things you should know about Thomas and his recruitment.\n1. Oregon State beat out quality competition to land Cynai Thomas\nThis is a significant early-cycle recruiting win for Oregon State and an impressive first-year victory for new wide receivers coach Pat McCann. Thomas had an extensive offer list, including Arizona, Arizona State, Auburn, Boise State, Cal, Duke, Iowa State, Minnesota, Ole Miss, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Washington State, among others.\nThomas previously spoke with BeaversEdge about McCann's role in his recruitment, emphasizing their strong connection.\n\"I feel like I’ve known him forever,\" Thomas said. \"We talked a bunch of times. He’s a great guy, and he knows what it takes to get to the next level.\"\nMcCann deserves credit for closing the deal on Thomas after Kefense Hynson’s departure to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n2. Cynai is the younger brother of current Beaver Skyler Thomas\nFamily ties played a significant role in Cynai Thomas' commitment to Oregon State, as he follows in the footsteps of his older brother, Skyler.\nSkyler, now entering his redshirt senior season, has been a key piece of the Beavers' secondary, totaling 113 tackles, one tackle for loss, and two interceptions. However, Cynai told BeaversEdge that how Oregon State supported Skyler during his injury-shortened 2023 season was a major factor in his decision.\n“It’s played a big role,” Cynai said when asked about his brother’s influence. “I saw how Oregon State treated my brother after he got injured,” he added, noting the program's positive approach.\nDespite the family connection, the Thomas brothers won’t get the chance to play together, as Skyler is set to wrap up his college career before Cynai arrives in Corvallis next year.\nManage privacy settings\n3. Thomas had a strong junior season for Archbishop Riordan\nThe California wide receiver has posted impressive numbers in consecutive seasons for Archbishop Riordan. As a sophomore, Thomas recorded 41 receptions for 679 yards and seven touchdowns. He built on that success as a junior, hauling in 47 receptions for 727 yards and 12 touchdowns.\n4. Northern and Central California continues to be a stronghold for Oregon State\nOregon State continues to excel in recruiting Northern and Central California, making it a focal point of their efforts year after year. So far this cycle, the Beavers have landed two prospects from the region in quarterback Deagan Rose and now Cynai Thomas.\nIn the 2025 recruiting cycle, they dipped into Northern and Central California for five commitments including quarterback Tristan Ti'a, wide receiver Elijah Washington, running back Kourdey Glass, and defensive end Logan Knapp. In the 2024 cycle, signees Aiden Sullivan and Amarion York both hailed from either Nothern or Central California. as well.\n5. This is the earliest Oregon State has had four commitments in the Rivals era\nBelieve it or not, this is the fastest Oregon State has picked up four commitments in a recruiting cycle during the Rivals recruiting era (1998–present). Despite a disappointing season, the Beavers have built momentum on the recruiting trail, a testament to Trent Bray and his staff.\nA full look at Oregon State's 2026 recruiting class\n• TALK ABOUT IT ON THE DAM BOARD\n• SUBSCRIBE TO OUR PODCASTS ON APPLE & SPOTIFY\n• LIKE US & FOLLOW OUR FACEBOOK\n• FOLLOW THE STAFF ON TWITTER - @Beavers_Edge, @b_slaught, @RivalsDylanCC, & @ryan_harlan",
