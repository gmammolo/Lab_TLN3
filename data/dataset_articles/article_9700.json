  "text": "Half a dozen homes were threatened when a wildfire broke out on Corning Road at Maette Drive near Freeman Schoolhouse Road about five miles west of Corning on July 7.\nCalifornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) firefighters responded to the blaze around 12:44 p.m. where tall, dry vegetation in a large gulley was burning, the fire being pushed by gusty winds.\nWith assistance from allied agencies and equipment, firefighters successfully fought to stop the fire from burning any homes or outbuildings in the area.\nCal Fire reported the fire eventually burned 21.12 acres, the cause still under investigation.\nOne man whose home was near the wildfire used his tractor with a disc attachment to cut a protective swath between the fire and residences in an effort to assist Cal Fire personnel.\nA Cal Fire helicopter made countless passages dispersing gallons of water on hot spots and a plane made rounds of dispersing firefighting chemicals on the blaze.\nAssisting Cal Fire was a Salt Creek Conservation Camp inmate fire crew, six engines, two water tenders and more attended the fire, working for hours for 100 percent containment and mop up.",
