  "text": "AEW has helped boost the careers of Cody Rhodes, CM Punk, and more according to a former World Champion.\nAfter reinventing himself on the independent scene, Cody Rhodes became one of the founding fathers of AEW and played a crucial role in getting the company off the ground in 2019. Although he later returned to WWE, his contributions to AEW are still having an impact.\nThe launch of AEW gave talent another major company to work for, vastly changing the wrestling landscape after years of WWE domination. This played a key role in CM Punk’s return to the industry, meaning he could have a high-profile run on television away from a company run by Vince McMahon. Not that either side lived happily ever after.\nFollowing several backstage incidents Punk was fired by AEW, and he also headed back to WWE. But according to a top AEW star, being All Elite helped both Punk and Rhodes on the way to being the stars they are today.\nAEW Helped CM Punk And Cody Rhodes During an interview with Bootleg Kev , Swerve Strickland said that because AEW provides another high-profile option for talent, it can help elevate them.\n“Sasha Banks had value, Mercedes has more value now because of All Elite Wrestling. Cody had more value because of what AEW was able to do, same with Punk, same with Moxley coming to AEW. Ricky Starks to Saints. Mercedes was the one that did big for the women… now it makes Becky Lynch look like a little hmm maybe. It makes New Day go, hmm maybe. Charlotte Flair, I wonder, maybe.”\nIn the same conversation, Swerve Strickland dived into the differences between AEW and WWE. The star explained that fans should be able to find beauty in those differences, and there’s room for them to support both companies.\nOn the March 19 edition of Dynamite, Jon Moxley will defend the AEW World Title against Cope in a Street Fight. The winner will go on to face Strickland at Dynasty after he became the number one contender with a win over Ricochet at Revolution.\nH/t to WrestlingNews.Co",
