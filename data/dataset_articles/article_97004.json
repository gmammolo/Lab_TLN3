  "text": "HANDBALL – AL Najma ended the title defence of Al Shabab and qualified for the semi-finals of the 2024-25 Khalid Bin Hamad Bahrain Handball League.\nNajma enjoyed the double success after winning their concluding meeting of the Top Eight stage 24-21 against Shabab at the Bahrain Handball Federation (BHF) Arena in Um Al Hassam.\nNajma had a slim 12-10 lead at the end of the first half and did enough to hold on to the advantage until the final buzzer.\nNajma claimed their second win in three outings to finish second in Group B in this phase of the league.\nThey had eight points, tied with Al Dair, who had a superior goal difference. Shabab suffered their second loss to go with just one win in this stage to miss out on the final four, ending their bid for back-to-back league crowns.\nDair defeated Al Ittifaq 34-28 in their last meeting, helping them claim first place in their pool.\nThey led 19-14 at the break in their match, and also ended this round with two wins and a draw, which came against Najma. Dair dealt Ittifaq their third straight loss in Group B of the Top Eight.\nDair and Najma now move on to the Golden Square semi-finals, which have yet to be scheduled by the BHF.\nDair will take on Group A runners-up Barbar, while Najma will face Group A winners Al Ahli in a titanic match-up.",
