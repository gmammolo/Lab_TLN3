  "text": "Now Playing Share Share Video Link copied! Robinson (ankle) is available for Wednesday's game against the Spurs, James L. Edwards III of The Athletic reports.\nRobinson made his 2024-25 regular-season debut Feb. 28 after recovering from left ankle surgery during the offseason. The Knicks are managing his injury by holding him out of one leg of back-to-back sets, which means he'll likely be held out of Thursday's game against Charlotte. Robinson will play Wednesday and will be limited to approximately 24 minutes of playing time, per Edwards.\nMore News Knicks' Mitchell Robinson: Questionable to face San Antonio 1D ago • by RotoWire Staff Knicks' Mitchell Robinson: Best outing in near double-double 2D ago • by RotoWire Staff Knicks' Mitchell Robinson: Records four steals 8D ago • by RotoWire Staff Knicks' Mitchell Robinson: Off injury report 10D ago • by RotoWire Staff Knicks' Mitchell Robinson: Ruled out Friday 12D ago • by RotoWire Staff Knicks' Mitchell Robinson: Available to play Thursday 13D ago • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Basketball Stories Iron men awards for 2025 Dan Bruno • 5 min read Week 22 start/sits Mike Barner • 4 min read Week 22 waiver wire Alex Rikleen • 6 min read Why the NBA's oldest stars thrive Dan Bruno • 7 min read Week 21 Start/Sits Adam King • 6 min read Week 21 waiver wire Alex Rikleen • 10 min read",
