  "text": "Streaming ATP Miami live tennis\n🎾 Thiago Seyboth Wild vs Quentin Halys\n* You can watch and bet on this match live here..\nSomething big may be brewing in the world of tennis right now, with Federico Cinà being a strong contender to join the list of players called to do important things in the future. At just 17 years old and after reaching his first final in a Challenger tournament, the Italian defeated Comesaña at the Miami Open 2025, achieving some astonishing precocity records.\nTennis runs in his veins, and he can convey sensations of power and a budding champion that are not common in a 17-year-old. Federico Cinà has claimed his first ATP victory at one of the most important stages on the global tennis calendar, the Miami Open 2025. He achieved this win against the current world No. 67, Francisco Comesaña, overcoming untimely cramps when he was one game away from winning the match, after putting forward all the arguments that make him one of the great promises of world tennis.\n- Federico Cinà is the son of a prestigious Italian coach\nWith a much more agile mobility than his notable stature suggests, the Italian is a player of the future in the present, a giant who moves swiftly across the court, executing levers that give unprecedented speed to his shots, while also displaying tactical intelligence and a disposition to endure from the baseline that are unusual for someone his age. He has become the first player born in 2007 to win a match in a Masters 1000, with a record of 10 victories and 1 loss so far this year, ensuring his entry into the top 400 next week.\nFederico CINA'🇮🇹 is the first player born in 2007 to win a match in a 1000 tournament.\n— Luca Brancher (@LucaBeck)[pic.twitter.com/1gdxKPHlVC][March 19, 2025]\nHe breathed in tennis from a young age as the son of Francesco Cinà, who was a coach for years to Roberta Vinci. A renowned coach in Italy, Federico's father owns his own academy in Palermo, the Cinà Tennis Institute, where the young player grew up under the watchful eye of his father. His serve is disruptive, showing offensive will and an outstanding forehand, as well as a very reliable backhand that gives away very little, executing interesting directional changes effortlessly.\n- Cinà is the 15th youngest to win a match in a Masters 1000 in history\nHe has room for improvement in physical aspects and in the power of his shots, but the maturity to manage emotions and tactical intelligence he displays present him as an example of triumphant precocity, suggesting the emergence of a generational talent. Proof of this is that he is the 15th youngest player in history to win his first match in a Masters 1000, achieving it ahead of Alcaraz and just a few days before Sinner and Fonseca did.\nHe will try to enjoy the experience of facing a legend of the current circuit, such as Grigor Dimitrov, who will be his next opponent at the Miami Open 2025. \"I'm exhausted but very happy. I couldn't even move due to cramps, but I kept fighting until the end. I wasn't going to give up. I'm very excited to face Dimitrov,\" stated a Federico Cinà who promises intense emotions on the circuit in the near future.\n📊 Les plus jeunes joueurs au moment de remporter leur premier match en Masters 1000 :\n— Jeu, Set et Maths (@JeuSetMaths)\n🇫🇷 Gasquet - 15 ans et 301 j\n🇪🇸 Nadal - 16 ans et 315 j\n🇷🇴 Pescariu - 17 ans et 10 j\n🇫🇷 Santoro - 17 ans et 97 j\n🇨🇦 Shapovalov - 17 ans et 101 j\n🇷🇺 Rublev - 17 ans et 156 j\n🇺🇸 Roddick - 17 ans…[pic.twitter.com/AMpmPhPvpf][March 19, 2025]\nThis news is an automatic translation.
