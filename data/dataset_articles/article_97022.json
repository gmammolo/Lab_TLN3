  "text": "For the first time since 2022, the Summit High School boys lacrosse team has won a game.\nIn the Tigers’ first game under head coach Drew Goldsmith, Summit took on Glenwood Springs High School in Breckenridge on Tuesday, March 18.\nDespite snow blanketing the field periodically, the Tigers played spectacularly and matched up well against their 4A Western league opponent.\nSenior captain Zander Reid led the team with three goals and an assist, while senior Graham Schuman recorded two goals off of three shots on net. Summit’s final goal of the game was awarded to sophomore Dublin Nelson.\nSummit defeated Glenwood Springs, 6-3, for the Tigers’ first win in three years.\n“If you put your mind to it, you can do it,” Goldsmith said. “Having the mental confidence and trying to snuff the mental doubts we all have in our minds is an incredibly powerful force. Those guys worked hard.”\nThe win would not have been possible without the effort from senior Sean Mullaly in net for the Tigers. Mullaly saved 21 shots en route to his first win of the season.\nSummit will now prepare to take on Vail Mountain School on the road on Saturday, March 22. The Tigers will then face Steamboat Springs in Steamboat on Thursday, March 27, before returning to Breckenridge to take on Battle Mountain High School on Thursday, April 3.\n“I am not certain what is in store for us, but we are ready to face the challenge,” Goldsmith said.",
