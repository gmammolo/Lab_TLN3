  "text": "Photo by Chris Unger/Getty Image UFC London on March 22 is flying under the radar, but it shouldn’t be. The main event sees welterweight champ Leon Edwards taking on Sean Brady, but the co-main? That’s where things get interesting. Jan Blachowicz, the former light heavyweight champion, is stepping back into the cage against Carlos Ulberg.\nBlachowicz isn’t just any former champ—he’s the guy who stopped Israel Adesanya’s perfect MMA run. Back in 2021, he shut down ‘The Last Stylebender’ when Adesanya tried to become a two-division champion. Now, after more than a year away from the octagon, he’s back. And this fight? It could decide whether he still has one more title run left in him.\nThe Fight That Ended Israel Adesanya’s Unbeaten MMA Record Let’s rewind to 2021, Israel Adesanya was unstoppable. He had just wrecked Paulo Costa at UFC 253, making the undefeated Brazilian look completely out of his depth. With the middleweight division cleared out, Adesanya set his sights on making history—moving up to 205 pounds to take on Jan Blachowicz for the light heavyweight title at UFC 259.\nBlachowicz had won that belt the same night Adesanya beat Costa, knocking out Dominick Reyes in brutal fashion. Reyes was the guy who had arguably beaten Jon Jones, but Blachowicz ran through him. Still, when the fight with Adesanya was booked, most people counted him out. The oddsmakers had Adesanya as the favorite. The narrative was set: Adesanya was too fast, too skilled, too slick.\nBut Blachowicz didn’t care about the hype. Over five rounds, he used his size, power, and smart grappling to completely shut Adesanya down. The UFC commentary team—Joe Rogan, Daniel Cormier, and Jon Anik—got blasted by fans for their clear Adesanya bias, but the scorecards told the real story. Blachowicz won a unanimous decision and handed Adesanya his first-ever MMA loss. The double-champ dream was over.\nJan Blachowicz vs. Carlos Ulberg: A Must-Win Fight\nSince that massive win, Blachowicz has had a mixed run. He lost the title to Glover Teixeira, beat Aleksandar Rakic (due to injury), and then fought to a draw in a vacant title fight against Magomed Ankalaev. His last fight? A competitive loss to Alex Pereira in 2023.\nAlso Read: Leon Edwards’ 8-Second UFC Knockout: One of the Fastest Finishes in History\nNow, he’s up against Carlos Ulberg, a rising contender who trains with none other than Israel Adesanya. Ulberg is on a seven-fight win streak with five finishes. A win here could catapult him into title contention. But for Blachowicz, this fight isn’t just about rankings—it’s about proving he’s still one of the best. If he pulls off another big win, the light heavyweight division will have to take notice.\nCome fight night, we’ll find out if Blachowicz still has that legendary ‘Polish Power’ or if the new wave of contenders is ready to take over.\nGet the latest IPL 2025 updates on Times of India , including match schedules , team squads , and live scores for CSK , MI , RCB , KKR , SRH , LSG , DC , GT , PBKS , and RR .
