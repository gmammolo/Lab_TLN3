  "text": "Game 2 of the Tokyo Series at the Tokyo Dome saw the Dodgers defeat the Cubs, completing the sweep to kick off their season.\nWith two wins in Japan, the Dodgers’ ambitious quest for a perfect 162-0 season is off to a strong start.\nJapanese superstar Rōki Sasaki made his highly anticipated MLB debut, taking the mound for Los Angeles in a homecoming of sorts.\nSasaki’s first six pitches clocked in at 99.5, 99.5, 100, 100.5, 99.4, and 98.9 mph, showcasing his electric velocity.\nHe allowed just one hit and one run while striking out three but struggled with command, issuing five walks, including one that forced in a run. Landon Knack (1-0) earned the win with two scoreless innings of relief.\nOn offense, Kiké Hernández launched a two-run homer, Tommy Edman added a solo shot, and Shohei Ohtani contributed a fifth-inning blast that just cleared the right-center fence. After a brief review, the call stood, extending the Dodgers’ lead to 6-2.\nWith the Tokyo Series in the books, both teams now return to the U.S. The Dodgers head straight to Los Angeles to prepare for their home opener against the Detroit Tigers on March 27, while the Cubs will regroup in Mesa, Arizona, before beginning their season on the road against the Arizona Diamondbacks that same day.\nSponsored Articles\nKHTS Santa Clarita News Alertsdelivered right to your inbox.
