  "text": "- Details\n- By Native News Online Staff\nFollowing the Oak Ridge Fire, Council Delegates Vince James and Brenda Jesus led a coordinated effort to distribute essential supplies to families returning to their homes. The initial phase of relief included the delivery of food, water, hygiene products, and cleaning supplies to assist residents in the early stages of recovery.\nIn partnership with the Oak Springs Chapter, St. Michaels Chapter, the Oak Ridge Fire Incident Command Post, Community Health Representatives, and local volunteers, Delegates James and Jesus ensured on-site distribution of critical resources to displaced families.\nCouncil Delegate Jesus also carried out home visits throughout the Oak Springs community to reach vulnerable households with direct support. Each care package contained bottled water, non-perishable food, baby items, hygiene kits, and personal protective equipment. Cleaning materials were also provided to help families safely remove debris and fire residue from their homes.\nBoth Delegates underscored the importance of sustained community engagement and made sure every returning household received immediate assistance and follow-up. In addition, they worked alongside local officials to assess and document long-term needs, including utility restoration and structural repairs.\nThe response effort represents a unified approach among Navajo Nation leadership, emergency management personnel, and community members committed to supporting recovery and rebuilding.\nDonations of non-perishable food, hygiene items, and cleaning supplies continue to be distributed. Residents are encouraged to contact their local chapter for information on future distribution events.\nCommunity members affected by the fire are also advised to reach out to their local chapter or the Navajo Nation Department of Emergency Management for updates on available services and ongoing recovery initiatives.\nMore Stories Like This\nNative News Weekly (August 25, 2024): D.C.

Briefs\nNational Native Organizations and Tribal Leaders Respond to Ann Clouter’s ‘We Didn’t Kill Enough Indians’ Remark\nHelp us tell the stories that could save Native languages and food traditions\nAt a critical moment for Indian Country, Native News Online is embarking on our most ambitious reporting project yet: \"Cultivating Culture,\" a three-year investigation into two forces shaping Native community survival—food sovereignty and language revitalization.\nThe devastating impact of COVID-19 accelerated the loss of Native elders and with them, irreplaceable cultural knowledge. Yet across tribal communities, innovative leaders are fighting back, reclaiming traditional food systems and breathing new life into Native languages. These aren't just cultural preservation efforts—they're powerful pathways to community health, healing, and resilience.\nOur dedicated reporting team will spend three years documenting these stories through on-the-ground reporting in 18 tribal communities, producing over 200 in-depth stories, 18 podcast episodes, and multimedia content that amplifies Indigenous voices. We'll show policymakers, funders, and allies how cultural restoration directly impacts physical and mental wellness while celebrating successful models of sovereignty and self-determination.\nThis isn't corporate media parachuting into Indian Country for a quick story. This is sustained, relationship-based journalism by Native reporters who understand these communities. It's \"Warrior Journalism\"—fearless reporting that serves the 5.5 million readers who depend on us for news that mainstream media often ignores.\nWe need your help right now. While we've secured partial funding, we're still $450,000 short of our three-year budget. Our immediate goal is $25,000 this month to keep this critical work moving forward—funding reporter salaries, travel to remote communities, photography, and the deep reporting these stories deserve.\nEvery dollar directly supports Indigenous journalists telling Indigenous stories. Whether it's $5 or $50, your contribution ensures these vital narratives of resilience, innovation, and hope don't disappear into silence.\nThe stakes couldn't be higher. Native languages are being lost at an alarming rate. Food insecurity plagues many tribal communities. But solutions are emerging, and these stories need to be told.\nSupport independent Native journalism. Fund the stories that matter.\nLevi Rickert (Potawatomi), Editor & Publisher",
