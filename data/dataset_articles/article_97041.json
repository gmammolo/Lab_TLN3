  "text": "KEVON LOONEY incredibly saved a reporter from injury during a live TV interview. The Golden State Warriors forward came to the rescue when speaking to NBC Sports reporter Kerith Burke. Looney was talking about his team’s defense at a training session ahead of their game against the Milwaukee Bucks . They were chatting courtside while the Warriors practised behind them. And suddenly a ball came flying towards Burke’s head – with her unaware of the danger. But Looney reacted quickly and stuck his arm out to tip the ball away from her head. She was able to duck out the way of the player’s saving swipe as the ice cool 29-year-old continued his answer like nothing had happened. Burke was left grinning ear to ear and then burst into hysterics. She said: “Man, thank you for saving my life.” After protecting Burke from a Jennifer Hudson incident , Looney then helped the Warriors to victory over the Bucks 104-93. It was a huge win for the Warriors and they did it without main man Stephen Curry who was rested for the game. Coach Steve Kerr explained the reason he missed out, saying: “He’s tired. Steph’s been carrying us for a month. He’s amazing. “We got to get him some rest. You can see it. He doesn’t have his energy right now.”",
