  "text": "On the Happy Hour podcast, Kevin Harvick’s co-host, Mamba Smith, shared a hilarious encounter when Austin Cindric met with Morgan Freeman, the actor famous for playing God in Bruce Almighty.\nThe legendary actor and narrator Freeman was chosen as the Grand Marshal for the NASCAR Cup Series Pennzoil 400 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Freeman delivered the iconic words “Drivers, start your engines” in what was met with a mixed response from NASCAR fans and veterans from the racing community and with many feeling his low enthusiasm command made it seem like he did not want to be there in the first place.\nAustin Cindric’s Reaction to Unexpected Exchange With Morgan Freeman\nTalking to co-hosts Harvick and Kaitlyn Vincie, Smith explained that some of NASCAR’s stars also got the opportunity to meet Freeman during pre-race festivities.\nDescribing what took place when Cindric met the ‘Driving Miss Daisy’ actor, Smith said, “He made it to the driver meeting, and he was he was meeting the drivers with Bubba and Bubba’s introducing him to like Cindric and William I think, and he, Cindric reaches his hand out to shake his hand, and Morgan looks at him don’t ever touch me again. Like it was so funny there’s a clip of it, it was hilarious.”\nNASCAR fans got a good laugh when Morgan Freeman playfully joked around with a few drivers before the race. As Bubba Wallace introduced Cindric to Freeman, he teasingly warned the actor not to trust Cindric. Playing along with the joke, Freeman shook Cindric’s hand and, with perfect comedic timing, told him, “Never touch me again.”\nThe lighthearted exchange became even funnier when Freeman realized Cindric drives the No. 2 car. In response to Freeman’s playful jab, Cindric laughed and said, “I take it you’re rooting for Bubba then?” Freeman responded by putting his arm around Wallace and making it clear that he was a Wallace fan through and through.\nWallace gifted Freeman a U.S. Air Force hat, which Freeman proceeded to don, replacing the Wallace No. 23 hat he was already wearing. Jokes apart, Freeman took a photo with Cindric, the 2022 Daytona 500 champion and a playoff contender for two of the last three years.\nWhile the trio joked about the funny reaction between Cindric and Freeman and discussed the actor’s presence in Las Vegas, Harvick shared on the podcast that he did not think Freeman’s command was very good. He said, “I’m just going to be honest with you. I thought his command was not very good.”",
