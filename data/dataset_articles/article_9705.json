  "text": "July 2024 didn’t just flood the fields and rivers of the Northeast Kingdom. It flooded the historical record books, the foundations of family homes, neighborhoods, communities and municipal infrastructure. Twice in one month, storms unleashed a level of damage typically measured in decades, not days — challenging not only local communities and emergency services, but the resilience of the NEK and its ability to recover.\nThe first disaster came on July 10 and 11. Heavy rain from the remnants of Hurricane Beryl soaked a wide swath of Vermont, with a narrow band tracking from Addison County through Caledonia and into northern New Hampshire. As water collected along brooks and rivers, evacuations and rescues occurred across the Kingdom. A second flood event followed on July 30, even more focused and intense. In just a few overnight hours, some areas received more than 8 inches of rain — triggering flash floods that tore up neighborhoods and swept entire homes off their foundations.",
