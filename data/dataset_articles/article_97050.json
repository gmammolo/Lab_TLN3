  "text": "Espanyol realized a Barça full of youth players to qualify for the fast track for the Catalunya Cup final. The game was a dazzled battle between Pericos, who formed with players of the subsidiary in its entirety, and a Barça that went with a mixture of soccer players (7), of the youth A (7) and the youth B (8). The result was a walk for the premises, which in the quarter of an hour had already sentenced the tie with three goals.\nThe main protagonist of the cold night in the Dani Jarque Sports City, in Sant Adrià, was Madrid’s Madrid. The striker scored the simplest hat-trick of his career and possibly one of the fastest.\nThree goals Víctor Mingo’s night\nThe first came in minute two of the game after a great center of Almansa from the right that Mingo ended with a crusade shot. In the second he took advantage of a misunderstanding among the centrals to beat the goalkeeper. Overcome the quarter of an hour, José Angel made the third with a shot from the front that Max Bonfill did not succeed to catch. At half an hour the room arrived, the third of Mingo, after a bad hafiz pass that the striker took advantage.\nSecond time Almansa completed his great game with a goal\nIn the second half the dynamics did not change and although Barça continued trying to monopolize the ball, the best occasions were for the Perico team.\nShortly after the Almansa resumption was the fifth after a personal play in which he left for his defender, surpassed the goalkeeper and sent the ball to the net before the central could arrive.\nThe multiple changes in both teams caused the rhythm to be lowered in the final stretch. Despite this, Mingo had the room after a great combination between Thymos and Justin, which ended with the pass of the latter to the penalty. With everything in favor, Mingo was not able to embocae to goal.\nPablo Ramón, Espanyol player\nCarlos Mira | RCDE\nBeyond the wide result and the classification for the final of the Catalunya Cup, the news was in Pablo Ramón’s debut with the blue and white shirt. The defender arrived in the last market from Real Madrid but had not arranged for minutes due to a serious ligament injury.\nThe Andorra and Girona will play the other square of the Grand Final.\n#Espanyol #wins #Barça #final #Catalunya #Cup",
