  "text": "After a thrilling 51st edition of The Players Championship that saw Rory McIlroy take down J.J. Spaun in a Monday playoff to earn his second victory of the 2025 season, the PGA Tour wraps up the Florida Swing this week with the Valspar Championship in Palm Harbor. While the Valspar doesn't have quite as strong of a field as we've seen the last two weeks, 18 of the top 50 players in the Official World Golf Ranking are set to tee it up at Innisbrook resort's famed Copperhead Course. With McIlroy and top-ranked Scottie Scheffler taking the week off, the headliner of this 156-player field is world No. 3 Xander Schauffele, who's still trying to find his game after missing two months with a rib injury. The two-time major champ tied for 40th at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and finished last among those who made the cut at The Players, finishing 72nd, so he'll undoubtedly be looking to get back on track at a course where he tied for fifth a season ago. Joining Schauffele from the top 20 in the OWGR are Tommy Fleetwood (No. 9), Justin Thomas (No. 10), Sepp Straka (No. 11), Shane Lowry (No. 15), Viktor Hovland (No. 19), and Billy Horschel (No. 20). And we certainly can't forget about defending champ Peter Malnati, who earned his second PGA Tour victory a year ago with a two-shot win over Cameron Young. For the first two rounds of the Valspar Championship, groups of three will tee off from both the 1st and 10th tees at the Copperhead Course at Innisbrook, which plays to a par of 71. Here's a quick look at the groupings and tee times for those first two rounds, which will be played on Thursday, March 20, and Friday, March 21 (all times Eastern).

The winner will also receive 500 FedEx Cup points. The Valspar Championship is a 72-hole stroke-play event. After all 156 players have completed 36 holes at Innisbrook, the top 65 and ties will advance to the weekend to play the final two rounds. Golf Channel will provide exclusive television coverage of the 2025 edition of the Valspar Championship during the first two rounds at the Copperhead Course on Thursday and Friday and will then split coverage with NBC over the final 36 holes. PGA Tour Live on ESPN+, Peacock, and the NBC Sports app will also offer streaming coverage.
