  "text": "THE GAME: The Angels scored five runs in the eighth inning, including two on a Jo Adell homer, to come from behind and beat the Cleveland Guardians, 6-3, in a Cactus League game on Wednesday in Tempe, Arizona.\nPITCHING REPORT: Left-hander Tyler Anderson gave up one run in six innings, the first time this spring that an Angels starter completed the sixth. Anderson struck out three and didn’t walk anyone. Anderson has allowed 13 earned runs in 15 innings this spring. He said he’s actually felt good, aside from when he gave up six in his previous start against the Athletics. “This whole spring, the numbers looked really bad, but I trusted what was going on better than what it looked like. My delivery’s in a good spot. My pitches are in a good spot. Execution I feel like has been not perfect, but good enough for spring. Today I was throwing more strikes and getting my delivery into a good spot where things looked more similar to each other. Fastballs looked like changeups. Changeups looked like fastballs. Cutters looked like fastballs. … That’s the last thing to come in spring, and that’s where you want to be.” … Right-hander Ryan Johnson allowed a two-run homer in 2⅓ innings. Johnson, who was just drafted last July, has allowed four earned runs in 9⅓ innings this spring. He has not issued a walk, though. … Left-hander Brock Burke recorded the final two outs.\nHITTING REPORT: Adell doubled, singled and then hit a homer in the eighth, snapping an 0-for-22 streak. “It’s one of those things where I felt like I was taking strikes and swinging at balls for a week or so,” Adell said. “I just continue to talk about decision-making. I got a couple pitches that I could handle, and it felt good.” Adell is 9 for 55 (.164) this spring. … Mike Trout was 0 for 3 with a walk. … Jorge Soler had a pair of singles. … Logan O’Hoppe struck out all four times, including once with a runner at third and one out. After a hot start to his spring, O’Hoppe is in a 2-for-20 slump, with 11 strikeouts. … Kyren Paris and J.D. Davis each had run-scoring hits to start the rally in the eighth, just before Adell’s homer.\nDEFENSE REPORT: Second baseman Tim Anderson and shortstop Kevin Newman collaborated on a nice double play in the first inning, with Anderson going into the hole and then firing back to second. … Newman made a diving catch of a line drive. … Trout successfully deked a runner from right field. Trout held up his glove as if he was going to catch a fly ball, so Kyle Manzardo went back to tag up at third. The ball dropped in front of Trout and he threw Manzardo out at the plate easily.\nUP NEXT: Angels (RHP Joel Hurtado) at Chicago White Sox (LHP Martin Perez), Thursday, 1:05 p.m. PT, at Camelback Ranch, FanDuel Sports Network West, 830 AM",
