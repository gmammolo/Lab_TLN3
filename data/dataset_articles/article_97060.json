HTX Soccer is thrilled to announce the renewal of its exclusive partnership with AutoNation, one of America’s largest and most recognized automotive retailers, for 2025-2027. This continued collaboration underscores AutoNation’s dedication to youth sports, community engagement, and fostering the next generation of athletes.\nA Winning Team: AutoNation x HTX Soccer\nSince 2021, AutoNation has been a proud supporter of HTX Soccer, and with this renewed agreement, the company is taking its commitment to new heights. More than 20,000 training jerseys will prominently feature the AutoNation logo, displayed on newly designed Adidas apparel, reinforcing the brand’s presence in the Houston soccer scene.\nBut the partnership doesn’t stop at jerseys. AutoNation will play a pivotal role in HTX Soccer’s internal events and programs throughout the year. A major highlight? The Houston Premier Cup series in January, which attracts over 400+ teams from Texas and surrounding states. As the exclusive presenting sponsor, AutoNation is helping to create unforgettable experiences for young athletes and their families.\nDriving Community Impact\nFor AutoNation, this partnership is more than just branding—it’s about investing in local communities.\n“At AutoNation, we strive to be America’s best place to buy and service cars and trucks, but our commitment goes beyond business,” said Edwin Braza, General Manager of AutoNation Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep RAM Spring. “We take pride in supporting organizations that positively impact the neighborhoods where we live, work, and play. HTX Soccer’s dedication to young athletes aligns perfectly with our mission. With 16 locations across Greater Houston, we’re here to serve not just on the road, but in the community.”\nBuilding the Future of Houston Soccer\nHTX Soccer sees this partnership as a game-changer for its players and programs.\n“We are excited to renew our partnership with AutoNation, marking it as the club’s first-ever exclusive car dealership sponsor for another two years,” said Simon Boddison, Director of Soccer Operations. “AutoNation understands the crucial role of youth sports in our community, and their support fuels our growth and operational expansion.”\nJoin the Movement\nThis renewed partnership ensures that Houston’s young athletes have the resources they need to train, compete, and thrive. Whether you're a player, parent, or fan, HTX Soccer welcomes all ages and experience levels.\nWant to be part of the action?
