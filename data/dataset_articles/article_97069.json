  "text": "SOUTH BEND, Ind. – The Notre Dame Softball secured home victory number one on the season and for Head Coach Kris Ganeff, defeating Western Michigan 2-1 on a windy day at Melissa Cook Stadium. The Irish are now 13-16 on the season.\nThe pitching duo of Kami Kamzik (4-5) and Shannon Becker were dominant in the circle. The Notre Dame tandem allowed only three combined hits, while only walking one. Becker earned her third save of the season and 17th in her career.\nKamzik’s final line was : 4.1 IP, 2 H, 1 ER and 3 SO. She didn’t walk a batter in her ninth start of the season today. Becker finished it after coming into the game with one out in the fifth, going 2.2 IP, 1 H, 1 BB and 2 SO. She threw a 1-2-3 bottom of the seventh inning to secure the win.\nAddison Amaral and Caroline O’Brien led the Irish offense against the Broncos. Amaral was 1/1 with an RBI double and two walks, while O’Brien finished with a pair of hits, including the game-winning RBI single to score Amaral in the bottom of the fourth.\nAmaral got the scoring started early for Notre Dame, lining a ball into the right center field gap to score Olivia Levitt all the way from first. It was the 24th RBI of the season for the Irish shortstop. She has reached base in 10-straight games.\nNotre Dame will turn its attention to this weekend when the Irish welcome 17th-ranked Stanford to Melissa Cook Stadium. First pitch of Friday’s game is set for 6:00 p.m. Admission is free to all Notre Dame softball games. Please take note that due to the Women’s NCAA Basketball Tournament being held at the Joyce Center, there may be an increase in traffic around campus.",
