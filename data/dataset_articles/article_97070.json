  "text": "Welcome to SB Nation Reacts, a survey of fans across the NCAA. Throughout the year we ask questions of the most plugged-in Michigan Wolverines fans and fans across the country. Sign up here to participate in the weekly emailed surveys.\nEarlier this week we asked fans how many games they think Michigan will win this weekend. The results are now in and fans are confident Michigan will win their first and second-round matchups in the NCAA Tournament and advance to the Sweet 16.\n80% of fans believe Michigan will have two wins this weekend, while 11% think it’ll be zero wins and 9% voting for one win.\nPer FanDuel Sportsbook, No. 5 seed Michigan (25-9) is a 2.5-point favorite over No. 12 seed UC San Diego (30-4) in their first-round matchup. If Michigan beats UCSD they’ll face either No. 4 Texas A&M (22-10) or No. 12 Yale (22-7) in the second round.\nHow did you vote this week? Let us know in the comments and come back next week for another edition of SB Nation Reacts.",
