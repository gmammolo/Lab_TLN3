  "text": "Izman Creek Fire\nIzman Creek fire near Lytton now considered to be under control\nJul 10, 2025 | 12:04 PM\nLYTTON, B.C. — The BC Wildfire Service says the Izman Creek fire north of Lytton is currently under control.\nIt’s another change in the status for the fire that was accidentally sparked on Canada Day after a wheel fell off a Mounties’ trailer as it travelled along Highway 12.\nThe fire was classified as “being held” at 243 hectares on Tuesday (July 8) night, and is no longer considered to be a wildfire of note.\nThat move prompted the Thompson-Nicola Regional District (TNRD) to lift all of its evacuation orders and alerts that had been in place since July 1. Residents in 12 properties were given the “all clear” on Wednesday (July 9) afternoon.",
