  "text": "Emilee Risteen looks to improve in Boston Marathon\nEmilee Risteen looks to improve in Boston Marathon\nWMUR SPORTS DIRECTOR MIKE CRONIN SHARES HER STORY. DERRY EMILY RISTINE IS A CONSTANT FORCE AT THE BOSTON MARATHON. SHE’S BEEN NEW HAMPSHIRE’S TOP FEMALE FINISHER THE LAST THREE YEARS. IT’S A LITTLE BIT OVERWHELMING, TO BE HONEST. THIS IS STILL I KNOW IT’S BEEN A COUPLE OF YEARS THAT I’VE BEEN AT IT, BUT IT STILL FEELS LIKE NEW AND IT STILL FEELS EXCITING. SO I JUST TAKE IT ONE DAY AT A TIME, AND EACH RACE IS LIKE A NEW CHALLENGE, AND I JUST WANT TO BE THE BEST THAT I CAN BE. THE 29 YEAR OLD IS RUNNING HER FOURTH STRAIGHT BOSTON TEN MARATHONS OVERALL. COME ON, JACK TO THE LINE. TO THE LINE. ROUTE 18 IS THE TRACK COACH AT HER ALMA MATER, CONCORD CHRISTIAN ACADEMY. AS AN ELITE RUNNER, SHE’S SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE BEST IN THE WORLD. IT’S INTIMIDATING TO BE HONEST, AND SO IT’S LIKE A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY LEARN FROM THEM AND JUST LIKE, RESPECT THEM. RISTINE HOPES TO QUALIFY FOR THE OLYMPIC TRIALS IN 2028, BUT FOR NOW, SHE’S HOPING TO BEAT HER. 2024 BOSTON TIME OF TWO HOURS, 43 MINUTES AND 12 SECONDS. I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE BOSTON MARATHON. IT’S DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE MARATHON. I LIKE THAT IT’S CLOSE SO MY FAMILY CAN ALL BE THERE, AND IT JUST HAS THAT UNIQUE FEEL OF LIKE A SMALL RACE, EVEN THOUGH IT’S NOT SMALL AT ALL. I THINK RUNNING IS SOMETHING THAT INTIMIDATES A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND I FEEL LIKE WE’RE STARTING TO SHIFT WHERE MORE PEOPLE ARE TRYING IT AND MORE PEOPLE ARE EXCITED ABOUT IT. AND I THINK IT’S SOMETHING THAT REALLY ANYBODY CAN DO. AND YOU JUST HAVE TO START SMALL AND JUST KEEP WORKING AT IT. AND YO\nAdvertisement\nEmilee Risteen looks to improve in Boston Marathon\nThis year – and every year – Emilee Risteen said she wants to improve.\nThis year – and every year – Emilee Risteen said she wants to improve.\nAdvertisement",
