PYLOS, Greece - The launch of preparations for the 2030 winter Olympics in the French Alps got off to a sluggish start amid political tensions, but the organising committee can benefit from the experience of Paris 2024 to make up for lost time.Heavy favourite Martin Fourcade, France's most successful Olympian, declined to take the organising committee president's job, saying he did not want to sacrifice his convictions.The 2030 Games will be held in two regions, Auvergne Rhone-Alpes and Provence Alpes Cote d'Azur, triggering tensions over control of the event, sources close to discussions about the event told Reuters.Edgar Grospiron, the 1992 Olympic freestyle skiing champion, was named head of the organising committee but he has yet to appoint a general director and the Games are still without a logo.Sports Minister Marie Barsacq said the experience of people involved in the 2024 Paris Olympics would help.",
