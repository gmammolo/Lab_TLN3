  "text": "At John Carroll, one great Luke deserves another.\nA year after Luke Chicone of Mentor was named Ohio Athletic Conference men’s basketball player of the year then earned second-team All-America honors, teammate Luke Frazier duplicated those accomplishments.\nMarch 19, Frazier, who at the completion of the Blue Streaks’ regular season was named OAC player of the year, added All-America honors to his impressive postseason accolades.\nFrazier, a Lake Catholic graduate, was named to the National Association of Basketball Coaches Division III All-America second team.\nFraizer is just the fourth JCU men’s basketball player to earn All-America honors by the NABC, but the second in two seasons. Other All-America honors went to Corey Shontz in 2012 and John Colombo in 1983.\nNo player in the OAC was a better stat stuffer this season than Frazier. He averaged 17.3 points and 6.8 rebounds — both top five in conference play — plus 3.2 assists. Frazier could be a defensive force as well, as he had 80 blocks in his career — many on the chase-down variety.\n“He’s a special talent. Talent which we’ve never seen at John Carroll,” said JCU coach Pete Moran about Frazier. “He’s able to change a game even on an off-night. It’s just his athleticism, picking his spots on the floor. He rarely takes bad shots. He’s just been sensational these last couple years.”\nFrazier was one of the program’s mainstays the past three seasons, an era that will go down as arguably one of the greatest in program history. During that time, the Blue Streaks won 20-plus games each season, posted a record of 71-14, won three OAC regular-season titles, two conference tournament titles and rose to No. 1 in the country in D-III during the 2023-24 season for several weeks.\nFrazier, whose post-JCU plan is to continue playing professionally overseas, saved some of his best performances this season for JCU’s biggest games:\n• Needing a win to clinch the OAC regular-season championship Feb. 22 against Muskingum, he scored 30 points, had nine rebounds, seven assists and four steals in his team’s 90-84 overtime win over Muskingum on Feb. 22. His 3-pointer with about a minute remaining helped the Blue Streaks rally from five points down to force OT.\n• Against Mount Union in the OAC tournament championship game, Frazier had 17 points, eight rebounds and two assists in JCU’s 82-69 victory.\n• Against York (Pa.) College in the team’s NCAA D-III tournament opener, a 72-69 loss, Frazier again stuffed the stat sheet in his final game with 24 points, 13 rebounds, four assists, two steals and four 3-pointers.\nDespite the NCAA game being his last hurrah in a JCU basketball uniform, Frazier’s athletic career at the university is not complete. He said he will compete as a high jumper for the Blue Streaks this spring. Last season, he joined the team and shortly after set the school record in the event.",
