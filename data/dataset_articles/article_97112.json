  "text": "He might be living half a world away in Michigan these days, but New Zealand track and field legend Nick Willis is all over the rise of teenage middle distance star Sam Ruthe, and he couldn't be more pumped.\nRuthe, who's just 15, became the youngest runner in history to break the four-minute barrier for the mile in Auckland last night, clocking 3m 58.35s.\nHis performance is generating huge excitement in the New Zealand athletics scene, with five-time Olympian and two-time medalist in the 1500m Willis, who spoke on RNZ's Morning Report, vying to be at the top of that list.\n\"He's just going from strength to strength, said Willis.\n\"Everything he seems to touch this season has turned to gold, and what a brilliant way to cap it off with the first ever sub four-minute mile by a 15-year-old.\"\nRuthe's been sensational this summer,\nHe also become the youngest to ever win a New Zealand senior title, after winning the 3000m in Napier.\nHe then added the 1500m in Dunedin last week, deadheating with Tokyo and Paris Olympian Sam Tanner, who paced for Ruthe in the cool and wet conditions at Mt Smart last night.\nWillis plans to keep a very close eye on how Ruthe progresses, and has extra reason to, having run against his dad and old mate, Ben, back in the day.\nWillis expects doors will now open with opportunities for Ruthe, if they haven't already, but is confident, he'll handle whatever the future brings.\n\"Ben Ruthe used to beat me quite handily when I was entering High School in the Wellington running scene back in the late 1990s,\" said Willis.\n\"But (while) he didn't quite make it, he's really careful.\n\"He's reached out to me a few times, just to make sure he's not going to get tempted by some early offerings by some of the major shoe companies or the major universities.\"\nAnd Willis reckons being patient is super important at this time, as there might be some out there who are willing to be a little bit more sinister, and manipulate parents into rushing certain decisions.\n\"Sam has brilliant and wise counsel surrounding him...people that not only know how to shelter him, but also help foster his talent to the best of his ability.\n\"He is in very good hands,\" he said.\nRuthe is next in action in Melbourne next weekend, when he runs in the 1500m at the Maurie Plant Meet.\nSign up for Ngā Pitopito Kōrero, a daily newsletter curated by our editors and delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.",
