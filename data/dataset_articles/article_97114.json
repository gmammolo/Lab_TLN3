  "text": "Leah Pruett’s racing hiatus is temporary, but her title as a “Dodge Mom” will be permanent. The 12-time NHRA Top Fuel National Event winner, married to NASCAR icon Tony Stewart, dropped her strongest hint yet about a return to drag racing during a recent Gainesville Raceway press conference. Since stepping back in late 2024 to welcome son Dominic, Pruett has balanced diaper duty with dyno tests while Stewart fills her seat in their Dodge-powered dragster. Her absence hasn’t dimmed her influence. Behind the scenes, she mentors crews and fine-tunes setups while plotting a comeback she calls inevitable. For Stewart, the message is non-negotiable: The moment she revs her engines, he’ll yield the cockpit. Pruett’s world since November 2024 orbits two universes: newborn chaos and nitro-burning precision. The 36-year-old gave birth to Dominic just hours before the 2024 NHRA Finals, swapping fire suits for midnight feedings. But the track’s siren call persists. She juggles pit crew strategy sessions with baby naps and troubleshooting clutch setups between diaper changes. Stewart, who replaced her in Tony Stewart Racing’s Top Fuel Dragster, admits her dual role astounds him. “She’s not sitting on her hands all day away from the kid—she’s working in this pit. So she has a full schedule, and we have help with Dominic here; things have gone really, really well,” he said. The three-time NASCAR champ knows his seat is borrowed. “That race car is her race car, and when she’s ready to get back in, I will immediately get back out,” he emphasized . “If mid-season, she says, I wanna get back in that car, I will gladly step out of that car for my wife.” Pruett’s timeline remains fluid, but her resolve isn’t. “I did not think that I could do a job for Dodge, for our fans, and be engaging with the team like I love to be, and also be a mom at Dodge,” she teased. “I’m a Dodge mom,” she burst into laughter. A renewed multi-year deal with Dodge adds torque to Pruett’s return plans. The automaker’s commitment to Tony Stewart Racing, netting 16 NHRA wins since 2022, anchors the team’s future. “It’s such a testament to what Dodge stands for, right? Power and muscle,” Pruett said. Stewart, who reached two finals in 2024, filling Pruett’s seat, credits her legacy for their success. The synergy between Pruett, Stewart, and Funny Car star Matt Hagan has turned TSR into a nitro powerhouse. But Stewart’s stint has an expiration date. “That is her team, and I’m just the fill-in guy,” he vowed. Pruett’s comeback path remains murky. She juggles developmental projects for Dodge while mastering motherhood, calling Dominic her “lottery win.” Stewart, meanwhile, savors fatherhood’s unexpected perks. A lousy run stings less when met with his son’s grin. Pruett’s return hinges on more than speed—it’s about legacy. For Dominic, for Dodge, and for a sport she helped redefine. The countdown to her comeback ticks quietly, drowned out by giggles and the idle rumble of a Hemi waiting for its queen.",
