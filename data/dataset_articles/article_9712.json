  "text": "Amidst heavy rainfall, the Indian Army has launched flood-relief measures in Himachal Pradesh, Assam, and Manipur as part of the ongoing Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations.\nIn a statement, the Army said that following the floods in Mandi district, the Indian Army, in coordination with the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and local authorities, has deployed dedicated relief columns.\nIndian Army columns have been mobilised across key locations, including Thunag, Bagsiad, and Pandoh. The Army personnel have been actively engaged in opening vital access routes, providing medical assistance, distributing relief material, and extending aid to inaccessible villages.\nAll columns are in communication via mobile networks, although coverage remains limited in some locations like Thunag. Satellite communications, including ISAT phone, RS STARSV, and HX systems, have been provided to ensure uninterrupted operational connectivity.\nIt further stated that the Deputy Commissioner of Dimapur formally requisitioned assistance from the Indian Army to provide immediate flood relief in Singrijan Colony, one of the worst-hit areas.\nThe Army swiftly responded with the deployment of an Engineer Task Force (ETF) team. While a verbal de-requisition was received later in the day, the Army remained on standby with resources mobilised through the Flood Relief Control Centre at HQ IGAR (N).\nIn Upper Assam, the Dhansiri River in Golaghat district has breached danger levels. Although water levels are now receding, the Indian Army continues to monitor the situation closely and is ready to intervene should the need arise.\nIn Manipur, the Nambol River flowing through Imphal West and Bishnupur districts has also surpassed danger levels. While floodwaters are beginning to recede, the Army remains actively engaged in relief operations in coordination with civil authorities.\nThe Indian Army remains steadfast in its commitment to assist fellow citizens in times of natural calamity. Through timely intervention, rapid mobilisation, and seamless coordination with civil authorities, the Army continues to provide life-saving support and essential relief to the affected population across the North East, the statement read.",
