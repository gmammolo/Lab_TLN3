  "text": "New Hampshire's top Boston Marathon finisher always seeking to improve\nAmong the professional field at the Boston Marathon this year will be an athlete who has consistently been the best from New Hampshire.\nThis year – and every year – Emilee Risteen said she wants to improve.\nRisteen, of Derry, is preparing for her fourth consecutive Boston Marathon, aiming to improve her personal best time.\n\"It's a little bit overwhelming, to be honest,\" Risteen said. \"I know it's been a couple years that I've been at it, but it still feels like new, and it still feels exciting, so I just take it one day at a time, and each race is like a new challenge, and I just want to be the best that I can be.\"\n>> Download the free WMUR app to get updates on the go: Apple | Google Play <<\nThe 29-year-old has been New Hampshire's top finisher for the past three years and is running her 10th marathon overall. Risteen also serves as the track coach at her alma mater, Concord Christian Academy.\nAs an elite runner, she's side by side with the best in the world.\n\"It's intimidating, to be honest,\" Risteen said. \"You're rubbing shoulders with some of the best marathoners in the world, and so it's a chance to learn from them and respect them.\"\nRisteen hopes to qualify for the Olympic trials in 2028, but her immediate goal is to beat her 2024 Boston Marathon time of 2 hours, 43 minutes and 12 seconds.\n\"I love everything about the Boston Marathon,\" she said. \"It's definitely my favorite marathon. I like that it's close so that my family can all be there, and it just has that unique feel of a small race, even though it's not small at all.\"\nRisteen said she's excited to see more people get into running.\n\"I think running is something that intimidates a lot of people, and I feel like we're starting to shift where more people are trying it and more people are excited about it,\" Risteen said. \"And I think it's something that really anybody can do. And you just have to start small and just keep working at it, and you might just surprise yourself.\"",
