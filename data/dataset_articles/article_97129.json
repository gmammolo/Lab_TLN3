  "text": "The Royal Colombo Golf Club (RCGC) will organise the much looked Captain's Cup 2024, an esteemed tournament scheduled from 21 to 23 March at their Club Course in Borella.\nThis annual event, which dates back to 1898, has been a cornerstone of the club’s traditions, honouring the Captain of RCGC while fostering a spirit of competition and fellowship among members. The only interruptions in its long history occurred during World War II (1942-1947) when the military occupied sections of the course, restricting play. Since then, it has remained a celebrated event in Sri Lanka’s golfing calendar.\nThe tournament follows a stroke play format, with the best aggregate nett score over two rounds determining the overall winner. The competition takes place over two medal rounds with 22 March morning and evening while on the final day only morning hours.\nThe event is open to all club members (ladies and gents) with a current playing handicap which is set up at 18 maximum for gents and 24 maximum for ladies. A special Masters, Seniors, and Senior Ladies category will also be included, with their nett winner and runner-up determined by a single round which is scheduled on the very first day.\nThe winner of the Captains Cup will hold the prestigious title for one year. Additionally, prizes, traditionally donated by the Club Captain, Amrith De Soysa, will be awarded to the winners and runners-up.",
