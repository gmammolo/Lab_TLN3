  "text": "By Shamseer Jaleel\nThe Clifford Cup is Sri Lanka’s premier knockout rugby tournament, first came into play during 1911 and later handed over to Central Province Rugby Football Union (CPRFU) in 1950. It remains the most prestigious competition in the country, featuring the top clubs battling in a high-stakes elimination format. Unlike the league, where teams have multiple chances, the Clifford Cup is a do-or-die tournament where every match determines a team’s fate.\nThe 2024/25 Clifford Cup Knockout Tournament kicks off on 26 March at the Nittawela Rugby Stadium when Kandy SC take on Sri Lions in the first quarter final encounter. The quarter finals will take place over four days, with other matches include Air Force vs CH and FC, Havelock vs. Army SC, and CR and FC vs Police SC. The winners of these matches will progress to the semifinals scheduled for 1 and 2 April and the final on 6 April.\nKandy SC enters the tournament as a strong favourite, having dominated Sri Lankan rugby for years. However, the unpredictable nature of knockout rugby makes every game a challenge. Havelock SC, CR and FC will be aiming to break Kandy’s dominance and claim the title. Unlike the league, where teams can afford occasional slip-ups, the Clifford Cup demands consistent high performance. Even a minor mistake can cost a team their championship hopes.\nPast winners of the Clifford Cup\n1950 - Havelock SC, 1951 - Havelock SC, 1952 - CR and FC, 1953 - Dimbula, 1954 -CR and FC, 1955 -CR and FC, 1956 - CR and FC, 1957 - CH and FC, 1958 - CR and FC, 1959 - CR and FC and Dimbula, 1960 -CH and FC, 1961 - Havelock SC, 1962 - CH and FC, 1963 - Havelock SC, 1964 - Havelock SC, 1965 -CR and FC, 1966 - CR and FC, 1967 - Havelock SC, 1968 - Havelock SC, 1969 - CR and FC, 1970 -Havelock SC and Police SC, 1971 - CR and FC, 1972 - Police SC, 1973 - Army SC and Police SC, 1974 -Havelock SC, 1975 - Army SC, 1976 - Havelock SC, 1977 - Havelock SC, 1978 - Havelock SC, 1979 - Police SC, 1980 - Police SC, 1981 - Havelock SC, 1982 - CH and FC, 1983 - CH and FC, 1984 - Police SC, 1985 - Police SC, 1986 - Air Force SC, 1987 - CR and FC, 1988 - CR and FC, 1989 - CR and FC, 1990 - CH and FC, 1991 - Police SC, 1992 - Kandy SC, 1993 - Kandy SC, 1994 - CH and FC, 1995 - Kandy SC, 1996 - Kandy SC, 1997 - Kandy SC, 1998 - No tournament, 1999 - Kandy SC, 2000 - Kandy SC, 2001 - Kandy SC, 2002 - Kandy SC, 2003 - Kandy SC, 2004 - Kandy SC, 2005 - Kandy SC, 2006 - CR and FC, 2007 - Kandy SC, 2008 - Kandy SC, 2009 - Kandy SC, 2010 - Kandy SC, 2011 - Kandy SC, 2012 - Kandy SC, 2013 – (No tournament), 2014 - Navy SC, 2015 - Kandy SC, 2016 - Kandy SC, 2017 - Kandy SC, 2018 - Kandy SC, 2019 - Havelock SC, 2020—2022 - No tournament, 2023 CR and FC, 2024 Police SC.\nMost number of wins\nKandy SC 22 CR and FC 15 Havelock SC 14 Police SC 9 26 March\nKandy SC vs Sri Lions at Nittawela\n27 March\nAir Force vs CH and FC at Ratmalana\n28 March\nCR and FC vs Police SC at Longdon Place\n29 March\nHavelock SC vs Army SC\nSemi-finals\n1 April\n2 April\nFinal\n6 April",
