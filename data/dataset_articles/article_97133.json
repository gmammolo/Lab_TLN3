  "text": "2025 has been an interesting year thus far for AEW, with the quality of weekly TV on the up, but the negatively-received main event scene has battled to keep the momentum of the company down. There have been plenty of positives throughout the year though, and certain wrestlers have stood out as being more important than ever to AEW.\nRelated\nEvery AEW Championship Design In 2025, Ranked Worst To Best\nWe will take a look at the current iteration of every AEW title in 2025, determining how nice they look from worst to best.\nWhether it be their star power, their consistent quality, or the value they hold to the long-term success of AEW, the following wrestlers have staked a claim for being the most valuable assets that Tony Khan has on his current day roster.\n10 Konosuke Takeshita\nAEW Can Always Count On Takeshita\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\n|\n9-2 |\nKonosuke Takeshita might not be a main eventer in AEW, but is always one of the absolute best wrestlers on the card on any given night, and that makes him so important to the weekly AEW product. Even on a weaker show, Takeshita can bring instant quality, as he showed in his run as International Champion.\nAEW needs to ensure that Takeshita continues being a key focus across shows, whether than be a nasty heel under Don Callis or eventually breaking out into a popular babyface star.\n9 Ricochet\nHe Has Become A Valuable Asset In 2025\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\nN/A |\n6-3 |\nIf you’d made the claim one year ago that Ricochet would be one of AEW’s most valuable wrestlers, you’d likely have been laughed at. However, his heel work in AEW has made him one of the most captivating and entertaining characters on the entire roster today.\nHe has been doing some of the best work of his career both on the mic and in the ring, making him a very valuable member of the roster. Bringing both character and in-ring quality is exactly what AEW needs on a consistent basis to build stars and keep fans enticed.\n8 Kenny Omega\nHis Return Has Been Needed For AEW\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\n|\n4-0 |\n2025 saw Kenny Omega return to AEW, and his arrival back on weekly programming has been massively important for overall star power on the show. Omega is a pivotal part of AEW’s history and he has been sorely missed during his injury absence.\nOmega has been better than ever between the ropes, having standout matches with the likes of Konosuke Takeshita and Kyle Fletcher. He is clearly very valuable to AEW, and the promotion will want to ensure he stays healthy for the whole year.\n7 Mariah May\nShe Is Both A Present And Future Women’s Division Star\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\n|\n2-2 |\nMariah May is just 26 years of age, and she has already played as one half of one of the best women’s feuds in professional wrestling history. She is only going to get better, and this makes her a hugely valuable star for AEW going forwards.\nRelated\n10 Best AEW Wrestlers Of 2025 (So Far)\nAEW's roster is full of talent, but who has been the best wrestler so far in 2025?\nEven though her reign as AEW Women’s World Championship wasn’t ideal, she showed glimpses of brilliance, particularly in her rivalry with Toni Storm. Her value comes in the fact that she is a star of both the present and future of AEW’s women’s division.\n6 Kyle Fletcher\nA Clear Star In The Making For AEW\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\nN/A |\n2-2 |\nAEW’s handling of Kyle Fletcher has been masterful over the last year, gradually building him up to being a defined star in the promotion and a clear star of the future.\nHis heel work has been getting better and better, and his resume of great matches is only continuing to grow as the months drive on. Given his age and talent, he is undoubtedly a hugely valuable member of the AEW roster.\n5 Mercedes Mone\nOne Of The Best Wrestlers In The World\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\n|\n4-0 |\nMercedes Mone’s time in AEW has experienced ups and downs, but she is still one of the most valuable members of the AEW roster. When matched with the right opponent, Mone showcases herself as one of the best wrestlers in the world, and that is exactly why she is so vital to AEW.\nMone has star power, crossover ability, and in-ring brilliance, and when AEW decides to push her to the very top of the division she will be even more valuable.\n4 Will Ospreay\nOspreay Is Already An Iconic Performer\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\n|\n10-0 |\nWill Ospreay has been a consistently great performer in AEW and he is always massively over with fans, and this type of connection with the audience is something that should not be overlooked.\nHis style, quality, and level of popularity is an element that can be turned into something special in years to come. He is one of the names on the AEW roster who can define the promotion and be built as a draw with the right booking. He has had some of AEW’s best ever matches already, and is constantly stealing the show into 2025.\n3 Adam Page\nHangman Can Always Steady AEW’s Ship\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\n|\n6-1 |\nAt AEW’s worst times, Adam Page has been one of the wrestlers who can pick up the pieces and deliver. In 2023 and 2024, his feud with Swerve Strickland was easily the best thing the company put forth, and in 2025 he has shown his importance once again by helping to turn MJF’s momentum around.\nPage is very much AEW’s main character and has been since day one. He is so valuable to the heart and soul of the company.\n2 Swerve Strickland\nStrickland Is A Gem On AEW’s Roster\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\n|\n3-3 |\nSwerve Strickland is the most valuable member of the men’s division in WWE. He is so unique to everyone else on the roster, has a complete package, and carries himself with immense aura.\nRelated\n10 Baffling AEW Creative Decisions They Already Made In 2025\nWe're only a few months into 2025 and AEW has already made some bad booking decisions!\nHe has been on top form for years now, and his value to AEW cannot be overstated. Whether it be as AEW World Champion, a blood feud with Adam Page, or carrying the upper midcard, Strickland is an absolute sensation and massively important to AEW’s long-term future.\n1 Toni Storm\nAEW’s Most Valuable Wrestler Right Now\nAEW Titles Won |\n2025 Win/Loss Record |\n---|---|\n|\n7-1 |\nToni Storm has been on fire for a while now, but 2025 has seen her take things to another level as AEW Women's World Champion. She is at the top of the food chain when it comes to women’s wrestling in any promotion, having one of the most captivating gimmicks of all time.\nAEW need to retain Storm for years to come, as she is the face of their women’s division and someone who is so unique, marketable, and talented, not to mention the fact that she is still young and has not even reached her prime.",
