  "text": "Johnell Davis is happy to help put Gary on the map.\nThe 21st Century graduate who now calls Arkansas his home after a memorable stint at Florida Atlantic has never stopped feeling the love from the Steel City.\n\"Knowing where I come from, ain't nobody really doubted I'd make it like that,\" Davis said. \"It just shows that Gary got my back and I got their back.\"\nAfter helping Florida Atlantic reach the 2023 Final Four, Davis is preparing for another shot at the NCAA Tournament as the Razorbacks prepare to take on Kansas Thursday at 6:10 p.m.\nThe Gary native's transition to Fayetteville has been a positive one.\n\"It's been a great transition,\" Davis said. \"Just enjoying the guys, the new guys and the coaching staff. They're bringing in the transition well with me. (I'm) just taking it all in.\"\nPeople are also reading…\nDavis also appreciates getting to play for Hall of Fame coach John Calipari and absorbing the lessons to be learned from a coach of his caliber.\n\"It's been a great experience,\" Davis said. \"(Getting) a different point of view of basketball, you know, just taking everything in (and) gravitating to his greatness.\"\nThe SEC was one of the deepest conferences in college basketball this season. The conference sent 14 teams to March Madness, a record for a single conference.\n\"You gotta bring your A-game every night,\" Davis said. \"Every night we played it was a tough night. We're just gonna try to be more physical and come out with confidence.\"\nDavis feels his postseason experience will help the Razorbacks on the floor in the postseason. He wants his teammates to remember not to take this experience for granted, to know difficult things will be — and great things might happen along the way.\n\"Just enjoy this, but if you enjoy it next thing you know we might be in the Final Four,\" Davis said. \"We're very confident. We know we got guys that are ready to play and we got guys that want to win that are all about winning.\"\nDavis hears from people in his hometown before every game sending encouragement, even when he's down, and he feels the love not just from Gary — but from the whole of Northwest Indiana.\n\"It's always love from people in Gary,\" Davis said. \"It just gives me more confidence that I got the whole city on my back. They have my back no matter what.\"",
