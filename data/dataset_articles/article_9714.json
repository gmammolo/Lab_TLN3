  "text": "Heavy rains lashing the Western Cape have sent dam levels soaring, with the latest figures showing that six of the province’s major dams are now above 80% of capacity , bringing welcome relief as winter storms continue to sweep the region.\nAccording to official data released by the City of Cape Town on Wednesday, 9 July , the combined storage of the six key dams now stands at 80.9% , a sharp increase from 73.6% just a week ago – and well above the 70.6% recorded during the same period last year.\nThe dams showing notable increases include:\nTheewaterskloof Dam : Now at 76.8% capacity – the largest dam in the province, responsible for over 50% of total water storage Voëlvlei Dam : At 75% capacity Berg River, Steenbras Lower, Steenberg Upper, and Wemmershoek Dams : All reporting gains and contributing to the strong collective total More rain on the way Meteorological forecasts predict additional cold fronts arriving in the coming days, which could further boost water reserves as the Western Cape continues to benefit from sustained winter rainfall.\nDay Zero a distant memory – for now The province’s water security has significantly improved since the 2017-2018 ‘Day Zero’ crisis , when dam levels plummeted and emergency water rationing loomed large.\nAt that time, Theewaterskloof dipped below 20% capacity, sparking fears of Cape Town becoming the first major city to run dry.\nAuthorities are urging residents to continue using water responsibly, despite the positive figures, reminding the public that climate unpredictability and long-term demand pressures still pose risks.\nWESTERN CAPE DAM LEVELS Do you still practice water-saving at your home?
