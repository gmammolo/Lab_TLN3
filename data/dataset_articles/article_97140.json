  "text": "The New York Mets are considered World Series favorites after shelling out a record-breaking $765 million contract for generational superstar Juan Soto .\nBeyond the Soto splash, they brought back homegrown All-Star Pete Alonso on a two-year deal, re-signed left-handed starter Sean Manaea , bolstered their pitching staff with Clay Holmes and Frankie Montas , and solidified their bullpen with A.J. Minter.\nThe Mets already boast one of the best lineups in the league. Along with Soto and Alonso, they feature 2024 MVP runner-up Francisco Lindor , Mark Vientos, and Brandon Nimmo. Francisco Alvarez, another key piece, will start the season on the injured list while recovering from a broken hamate bone in his left hand.\nAfter their surprise run to the NLCS where they were dispatched by the eventual World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers , the Mets now have the fifth-best odds of winning the title themselves, according to DraftKings .\nWith such high expectations, is it World Series or bust for the Mets? A team analyst is sharing his perspective.\nNew York Mets analyst reveals 2025 win total In an interview with Sporstnaut’s “The Deferrals” baseball podcast , Mets On SI contributor and “Mets Daily” host Jake Brown said the goal is the World Series, but the season won’t be a failure if they don’t win a championship in Year One of the Soto Era.\n“Is it World Series or bust? Not exactly. I think that’s the goal. I think that’s a realistic goal because, listen, if you could take down the Dodgers in a best of seven, there’s no question they could beat anyone from the American League,” stated Brown.\nBrown told “The Deferrals” that the Mets will need to stay healthy and add an arm to a rotation that’s already dealing with injuries to Montas and Manaea.\n“If they stay healthy and add someone to the rotation, I think they can compete for a title. I won’t call it World Series or bust. If they missed the playoffs, that’s a disgrace. I mean, that’s the bare minimum, where last year it was compete for the playoffs,” Brown added.\n“This year is, at least, get to the playoffs and then try to take down the Dodgers. That’s the goal. I’m encouraged. I think at the minimum this is a 90-win team. If everything goes bad, 85 at the worst. But I think this team should win anywhere between 90 and 95 games.”\nThe battle in the National League East promises to be fierce, with the Mets having to contend with powerhouse rivals in the Atlanta Braves and Philadelphia Phillies . According to DraftKings, the Braves and Phillies currently have the second- and fourth-best odds to win the World Series, respectively.\nThe Mets haven’t been to the World Series since 2015, when they lost to the Kansas City Royals in five games.",
