  "text": "March Madness has arrived, and Alabama is a No. 2 seed in the 2025 NCAA Tournament. The Crimson Tide traveled to Cleveland, Ohio, on Wednesday, where it will face 15-seed Robert Morris in the first round on Friday, March 21. The matchup will tip off at 11:40 a.m. CT on truTV. The Alabama-Robert Morris winner will move on to the Round of 32 to take on either No. 7-seed Saint Mary’s or 10-seed Vanderbilt on Sunday, March 23 – also in Cleveland. This is Alabama’s 25th NCAA Tournament appearance in program history, with the Tide owning a record of 27-24 (.529). UA is coming off the program’s first-ever Final Four appearance and has made the big dance five consecutive seasons under head coach Nate Oats . Alabama enters the NCAA Tournament after losing to No. 1-seed Florida in the semifinals of the SEC Tournament. The Tide had won back-to-back games, including a win over the tournament’s No. 1 overall seed Auburn, before losing to the Gators in Nashville. In the defeat, Grant Nelson suffered a left knee injury and will be questionable for Friday’s first-round game. Before Alabama takes on Robert Morris at Rocket Arena, BamaOnLine staff members Charlie Potter, Tim Watts and Blake Byler share their thoughts on the Tide and March Madness. The Alabama-related topics discussed by the guys include: – Where does the NCAA Tournament rank among all major sporting events? – Final thoughts on the SEC Tournament – No need to overreact to Florida loss – Discussing Grant Nelson’s health – Alabama’s NCAA Tournament draw: good or bad? – How far do you think Alabama goes?
