  "text": "Everyone is hopping in on the March Madness bracket-making fun, and by everyone, I mean everyone . Celebrity brackets have been a hot commodity the last several years, and that’s no different this time around. The latest to hop on the trend was hip-hop star Flavor Flav. The Grammy Award winner and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee has a very favorable bracket for Kentucky, even going as far as to pick the Cats to make their first-ever Final Four appearance. In his bracket, he has Kentucky, North Carolina, Michigan and LSU in Tampa, with Kentucky falling to the eventual champion Tigers. On Kentucky’s path to Tampa, Flavor Flav has the Cats beating 13-seed Liberty, 5-seed Kansas State, 1-seed USC and 3-seed Oklahoma. If you’re a betting man, Kentucky should probably win those first two games, and they’ve already beaten the Sooners this season. That Sweet 16 matchup against the Trojans is the trickiest one, especially with that game being out in Spokane where it could almost even be a home game for them. In a one-game scenario though, why not Kentucky, right? Kentucky getting to a Final Four for the first time ever in just one year under Kenny Brooks would be pretty sweet. As Flavor Flav would say… yeah, boy ! The post Flavor Flav picks Kentucky WBB to make its first-ever Final Four appeared first on On3 .",
