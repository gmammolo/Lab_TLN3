  "text": "Introduction to a New Era Starting Friday, a fresh chapter in English football begins.\nThomas Tuchel, a German football manager, is set to become the England national team’s third non-British coach, following in the footsteps of Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello.\nUnder the previous leadership of Gareth Southgate, the team achieved remarkable milestones, reaching the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and finishing as runners-up in the Euros in both 2021 and 2024.\nNow, at 51 years old, Tuchel has signed an 18-month contract with a daunting mandate: to qualify for and claim victory in the 2026 World Cup.\nHe is eager to make an impactful start, with upcoming qualifying matches against Albania and Latvia scheduled to be held at Wembley.\nFans are curious about what style of play and tactics Tuchel will implement, given his successful management experiences with esteemed clubs like Chelsea, Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, and Bayern Munich.\nTo gain insight into Tuchel, BBC Sport has interviewed colleagues and acquaintances who have had significant interactions with him.\nA Journey from Bartending to Coaching Standing tall at 6 feet 4 inches, Tuchel transitioned from a player to a manager after an injury cut short his career at the young age of 25. His initial playing days included a stint at Stuttgarter Kickers followed by three years at SSV Ulm, where he ultimately encountered a serious knee injury.\nRalf Rangnick, who coached him during his time at Ulm, noted Tuchel’s curiosity and eagerness to learn. Rangnick recalled, “He always questioned the reasons for our practices. It was apparent he had the potential to become a coach.”\nIn 2000, Tuchel was reportedly working in a bar to sustain himself, a surprising fact for Rangnick when he became head coach of Stuttgart. Recognizing Tuchel’s talents, he reached out to him, suggesting he take a position coaching a youth team. Thus, Tuchel’s coaching journey began.\nRangnick commented, “It was evident he deserved to be on the pitch, not serving drinks.”\nA Bright Mind Tuchel’s dedication and intelligence have been recognized by many in football. He began cultivating his coaching skills by training Stuttgart’s youth teams, eventually leading their under-19 squad to a league title.\nHis first official managerial role started in 2007 at FC Augsburg II, and by 2009, he had taken over at Mainz in the Bundesliga, continuing a legacy that includes having Jurgen Klopp as a predecessor.\nRangnick wasn’t surprised by Tuchel’s rise to prominence, stating, “He possesses the fundamental qualities needed in a manager.”\nDuring his tenure at Mainz, Tuchel was responsible for securing European qualification twice, even achieving the club’s highest Bundesliga finish at fifth place.\nFormer Germany midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger observed Tuchel’s continuous quest to learn from other managers, incorporating elements of their strategies into his own philosophy, particularly focusing on both defensive and offensive play.\nOvercoming Doubts Taking on the managerial role at Borussia Dortmund in 2015, Tuchel had the challenge of winning over a team still adjusting to the departure of Jürgen Klopp. Initial skepticism from players like İlkay Gündoğan himself was transformed into respect and admiration through Tuchel’s clear communication and tactical acumen.\nAccording to Gündoğan, “He articulated his vision for our style of play effectively, and he demonstrated his plans throughout the season.”\nTuchel won his first major trophy at Dortmund with a DFB Pokal victory shortly before his abrupt departure from the club. Gündoğan emphasized the positive experience he had with Tuchel, praising his tactical and interpersonal skills.\nHitzlsperger suggested that Tuchel’s adept manner with players will be crucial in adapting seamlessly into his new role with England, stating, “Players are familiar with foreign coaching styles, and Tuchel has proven to be a top-tier manager.”\nA Complex Yet Successful Coach Known for his complex personality, Tuchel has faced challenges in previous roles at Dortmund and Bayern Munich, often resulting in confrontations with club management. Former Mainz executive Christian Heidel remarked, “Good coaches often have demanding expectations, which can be challenging to navigate.”\nTo succeed with the England setup, Tuchel must maintain a positive rapport with the Football Association, steering clear of prior issues he faced at club levels where disagreements emerged over player transfers.\nAs the new England manager, Tuchel has already made notable decisions, such as recalling seasoned players and including new faces into the national squad, indicating his intent to rejuvenate the team.\nAiming for Success Hitzlsperger believes Tuchel’s coaching experience and innovative football style will reinvigorate England’s national squad, making it exciting for fans. With the 2026 World Cup in view, Tuchel aims to become only the second manager after Sir Alf Ramsey to lead England to victory in the tournament.\nHitzlsperger speculated, “Tuchel would relish the opportunity to face Germany. Defeating Germany in a World Cup match would be an extraordinary achievement for him.”\nAs the England team embarks on its new journey under Tuchel’s guidance, the country watches with hope for a promising future on the pitch.",
