  "text": "New Delhi, Jul 10: The Central Government has approved the release of Rs 1,066.80 crore to six states severely affected by floods, landslides, and heavy monsoon rains. The funds have been allocated as part of the Central share of the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), according to a press release issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on Thursday. The financial assistance covers the states of Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Kerala, and Uttarakhand, all of which have witnessed widespread damage due to extreme weather conditions during this year’s south-west monsoon.\nAssam received the highest allocation of Rs 375.60 crore, followed by Uttarakhand with Rs 455.60 crore. Kerala was allotted Rs 153.20 crore, Meghalaya Rs 30.40 crore, Manipur Rs 29.20 crore, and Mizoram Rs 22.80 crore.\nThe Home Ministry said, “Under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and guidance of Union Home Minister Shri Amit Shah, the Central Government is fully committed to provide all possible assistance to flood, landslides, cloudburst-affected states.” It added, “The Modi government stands resolutely beside the states in all situations.”\nSo far in 2025, the Centre has released Rs 6,166 crore from the SDRF to 14 states and Rs 1,988.91 crore from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) to 12 states.
