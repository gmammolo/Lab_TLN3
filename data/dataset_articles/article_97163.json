  "text": "It doesn’t take long to understand why Taylor Schepp’s career trajectory has only pointed up.\nThe Dakota Lancers’ point guard is all business when it comes to basketball, and it shines when she’s on the floor.\n“She’s as true as it gets as a point guard. Plays with a high motor, great shooter, great passer, and probably one of the best kids I’ve ever coached with her IQ for the game,” said Lancers head coach Eric Sung, who has headed the women’s varsity program for the last decade.\nSchepp, the daughter of University of Manitoba Bisons men’s basketball head coach Kirby Schepp, was named the top women’s hoopster in the Free Press ’ annual coaches poll of the top 10 high school players in the province due to her dynamic ability on the floor, but it’s the Grade 12’s dedication off the court that is rare for someone her age and has drawn rave reviews.\nMIKAELA MACKENZIE / FREE PRESS FILES\nDakota Lancers’ Taylor Schepp (right) is all business when it comes to basketball. Her head coach, Eric Sung, said she’s ‘probably one of the best kids I’ve ever coached with her IQ for the game.’\n“Her separator is her work ethic and her love of the game. She’s always loved the work. She’s always loved putting in time,” said Kirby, who has intentionally remained in a supporting role throughout his daughter’s career. “In my over 30 years being involved in coaching, I’m not sure I’ve had an athlete that’s worked harder at the game than her.”\nSchepp naturally gravitated to basketball after being in a gym from a young age (Kirby used to wear a BabyBjörn while coaching the provincial team). She immersed herself in the game as a pre-teen, watching film with her dad, breaking down strategies and running drills in her backyard.\nHer commitment reached a new high during the pandemic when she used the extra time at home to hone her skills. There’s one month Kirby remembers vividly.\n“It was a February, and she had a goal of 100 workouts in a month, and a workout had to be at least 20 to 30 minutes of concentrated… effort in a certain area, working on a skill,” he said.\n“Her separator is her work ethic and her love of the game. She’s always loved the work. She’s always loved putting in time.” –Kirby Schepp\n“That works out to a little over… three a day, and I think she got 110 or something. She averaged almost four a day. That’s just an example of: she picks a goal, and it’s often a process-oriented goal, and goes for it. And the payoff of doing that over many, many years is she got better.”\nSchepp is the focal point of a Lancers team that is seeking an unprecedented fourth-straight AAAA provincial title. Dakota was two wins away from that feat as it prepared to face the Garden City Gophers in Wednesday’s semi-final.\nWhile Schepp’s ability on the offensive end has earned her the most attention — she rose to prominence after scoring 54 points and being named MVP in a 74-67 win over Maples in the provincial AAAA junior varsity championship final in 2023 — she’s more thrilled about her improvement on the defensive end.\nFree Press Top 10\nA list compiled with voting from a panel of 10 high school coaches.\n1. Taylor Schepp, point guard\nDakota Lancers, Grade 12\nProfile: She is an offensively dynamic point guard with an explosive first step, she has a deadly pull up jumper and has excellent range from the three-point line. She has great basketball IQ and court vision and can often beat any press with her ball handling abilities.\nClick to read more 1. Taylor Schepp, point guard\nDakota Lancers, Grade 12\nProfile: She is an offensively dynamic point guard with an explosive first step, she has a deadly pull up jumper and has excellent range from the three-point line. She has great basketball IQ and court vision and can often beat any press with her ball handling abilities.\n2. Lilly Vande Graaf, guard\nVincent Massey Trojans, Grade 12\nProfile: A devastating presence at the top of their 1-3-1 full court press, her long athletic frame causes so many turnovers and deflections in the full court which often leads to open layups for herself or her teammates. Offensively she likes to play out on the perimeter where she uses her court awareness by slashing to the rim or finding teammates for open looks. She has developed a consistent jump shot and three-point shot. She has good touch around the rim.\n3. Jennifer Edwards, guard\nVincent Massey Trojans, Grade 12\nProfile: She is an energetic guard that can get to the rim but can also hit the open jump shot or three ball. She is arguably one of the best one ball defenders in the province, with her active hands and body control she can easily strip her opponents of the ball or force turnovers in the open court.\n4. Martha Lado, guard\nKildonan-East Reivers, Grade 12\nProfile: Hard working player, with good range and a good first step. Physical guard that likes to push the ball in transition and tries to find different ways to get to the hoop. Can be a deadly scorer when left wide open and she can drain a three-point shot from any range.\n5. Jenelle Deato, guard\nGarden City Gophers, Grade 12\nProfile: She is a crafty guard that plays bigger than her size, with good ball handing skills which often creates offensive opportunities for herself and her teammates. She is an up-tempo type of player, that likes to push in transition which often leads to transition baskets.\n6. Eliana Stark, post\nMiles Macdonell Buckeyes, Grade 12\nProfile: An outstanding athlete has just scratched the surface of her basketball potential as she moves to focus on her development on the court. She likes to run the floor and get the easy finish at the rim. Tough physical presence in the paint, her agility allows her to alter shots and grab multiple rebounds. She has excellent touch around the rim.\n7. Emilie McLean, forward\nDakota Lancers, Grade 11\nProfile: A hard-working player that continues to develop her game. Her improvement on making the correct offensive reads have led to her scoring multiple baskets and being a force on the rebounding glass. She has an athletic defensive presence in the paint and can alter shots and grab multiple rebounds on the offensive and defensive ends of the floor.\n8. Ann Celeste, point guard\nSisler Spartans, Grade 12\nProfile: A true shooting guard and at only five-feet tall she can find different ways to get to the hoop. She has excellent shooting range and when she gets going has a deadly jump shot. She is a good on ball defender with active hands which often lead to deflections and steals.\n9. Avneet Kainth, guard\nMaples, Grade 12\nProfile: A dynamic guard that can get to the rim and has unbelievable shooting range. She likes to push the ball in transition and can find time and space to get her shot off uncontested.\n10. Emma Elliott, guard\nJeanne-Sauvé Olympiens, Grade 11\nProfile: Hard working player, with good range and a good first step. Physical guard that likes to push the ball in transition and tries to find different ways to get to the hoop. A leader at both ends of the floor as she helps her team create looks to score and create steals.\nHonourable Mentions:\nYar Mach, post\nJohn Taylor Pipers, Grade 11\nHalle Penner, forward\nSanford Sabres, Grade 11\nClose “For me, that used to be more just contain the ball and try not to get beat, kind of situation for me. But I think now I’m somebody who I’ve worked really hard on getting stronger and my IQ and being able to anticipate on defence, and now I think I’m somebody who can really bother the ball and be a little bit more annoying on defence,” she said.\nSchepp can still take over a game with her scoring, though she prefers to facilitate. She has the ball in her hands on most possessions and dictates the pace of the Lancers offence.\n“I think she’s a scorer at multiple levels now,” said Sung. “She was mainly a pass-first point guard for us last year, and then flipped to this year now, she’s had some large offensive games for us where she’s making big plays, but then she’s also making the right play.\n“If they send multiple bodies at her to stop her, she’s going to make the right pass, she’s going to make the right play and give somebody else the opportunity to reap the benefits of her drawing attention to herself.”\nSchepp was heavily recruited by several Canadian universities but chose a familiar spot with the Bisons, where she will play for Sung’s wife, Michele, this fall.\nHer sights are set on something bigger, though, and that continues to drive her chase to becoming an all-around player.\n“It’s extremely important to me. I think for me, being a good high school player is not my end goal. I know to be a really great university player, and a goal of mine is to later play professionally, so I think to be able to get to those goals, I’m going to have to be a really good defender and improve offensively and continue to get better every year,” she said.\nThe Lancers have featured some talent-laden rosters with players that have gone on to play U Sports during its recent stretch of championships, including Kyu and Izzi Fust, Darya Rom and Abby Sweeny, but this is the first time Schepp will be the one leading the charge.\nWinnipeg Free Press | Newsletter Mike McIntyre | On Sports Thursdays\nKeep up to date on sports with Mike McIntyre's weekly newsletter.\nSign up for Mike McIntyre | On Sports Sign Up I agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies , and CASL agreement . Ask anyone, including Schepp, and they’ll say these are the games she’s prepared herself for.\n“I know I’m ready for these moments. And it’s not all about me,” Schepp said.\n“I’m going to have the ball in my hands, but I want to make sure that our team is at the best that it can be. And so whether that be defending the best player, or scoring or setting up other girls for easy baskets and putting us in positions where we’re going to be successful, is something that I look to do in these big games.”\njoshua.frey-sam@freepress.mb.ca",
