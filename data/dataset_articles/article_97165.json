  "text": "Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. (NYSE: RGR) is excited to share that Team Ruger has maintained a fast start to the 2025 season, achieving several divisional wins over the past few weeks.\nIn February, Gordon Carrell and Randi Rogers took on the 2025 SASS End of Trail Championship held in Phoenix, AZ. The pair competed in the Wild Bunch Cowboy Action discipline that incorporates 1911-style pistols, lever-action rifles and vintage era shotguns, and the traditional Cowboy discipline that requires the use of single-action revolvers. Randi, better known as \"Holy Terror,\" in the SASS community, went on to dominate in both disciplines. Competing with her Ruger Custom Shop® SR1911® and Marlin® Classic Series Model 1894™, Randi took High Lady as well as first place overall in the Wild Bunch competition. She then took it all in the Top Gun Shoot-Off competition, going up against the top 16 ladies and the top 16 cowboys. In the Cowboy-action event, Randi competed with her Ruger Vaquero® revolvers and Marlin Classic Series Model 1894 chambered in .357 Magnum, finishing the week taking first place in the Lady Wrangler division and High Lady overall.\nMeanwhile, Lauryl Akenhead and Aaron Martin competed at the MDT Frostbite PRS Championship held in East Butterfield, IN. Competing with her Ruger Custom Shop Ruger Precision® Rifle, Lauryl secured a first place finish in the Production division as well as High Lady overall, while Aaron Martin drew in a second place finish in the Sportsman division competing with the Ruger Precision Rifle chambered in 6mm Creedmoor. Lauryl followed up shooting the Clays Cartridge Classic PRS Match held in Leedey, Oklahoma, capturing first place in the Production division as well as High Lady overall with her Custom Shop Precision Rifle.\nNew team member Steve Foster made a run at the Georgia State Steel Challenge, achieving a second place finish in both the Rimfire Rifle Optic and Rimfire Pistol Iron divisions with his Ruger® 10/22® rifle and Mark IV™ pistol, respectively. Additionally, he secured a third place finish in the PCC Optics division using his Ruger PC Carbine™ rifle.\nRuger congratulates each team member on their dedication and achievements in this outstanding start to the season. Their performances highlight the accuracy and reliability of Ruger firearms under the pressures of competitive shooting.\nFor more information about the extensive line of award-winning Ruger firearms, visit Ruger.com, Facebook.com/Ruger or Instagram.com/Rugersofficial.
