  "text": "It's the most exciting month in all of basketball. We have the homestretch of the NBA regular season, and the main reason why the next four weeks will be crazy fun for hoops fans, the NCAA Division 1 Tournament, otherwise known as March Madness.\nFrom 352 Division 1 teams, they chose 68, which will whittle down to 64 on the first day. Then, the madness begins with the single-game elimination, \"win or go home\" format. From the two opening rounds, to the Sweet Sixteen, the Elite Eight, the Final Four, and the National Championship.\nJust before the regular season ended, the Duke Blue Devils won the ACC tournament, and wrested the no.1 ranking from Auburn University. The Auburn Tigers lost in the SEC semifinal, while Duke took care of business and beat Louisville. For most of the season, Auburn was at no.1, and Duke lingered at the second and third spots due to early losses to Kentucky and Kansas. Since then, they only lost once the rest of the way, to the Clemson Tigers.\nWith or Without the Flagg",
