  "text": "After clinching a victory against the Ottawa Senators, the Montreal Canadiens have leaped over the New York Rangers to secure the last wild-card position in the Eastern Conference. Staging an impressive comeback from a 2-1 deficit after two periods, the Canadiens put on an explosive third-period performance, scoring five goals to outmaneuver the Senators. This victory propels them back into the playoff realm, a position they hadn’t held since January 21st.\nWhile the Canadiens’ current position remains somewhat delicate, their prospects seem bright. They hold a one-point lead over the Rangers, with the added advantage of two yet-to-be-played games. The New York Islanders and the Columbus Blue Jackets trail by three points, paralleling the Canadiens in the number of games played. The Detroit Red Wings, possessing an equal 70 points, have played one game more than Montreal.\nThe Canadiens face a crucial away game against the Islanders on Thursday. A win here could provide the Canadiens with a much-needed cushion in their playoff race. In the aftermath of Tuesday’s win, Canadiens captain Nick Suzuki highlighted the gravity of the situation. He acknowledged, “This was our biggest win of the season for sure. And the next one’s going to be the biggest one. We’re in playoff mode right now. We can’t afford losses and giving up points.”\nMeanwhile, the Rangers’ Tuesday loss to the Calgary Flames, managing a mere 13 shots, was a significant blow. Their coach, Peter Laviolette, expressed his dismay at the lacklustre performance, noting, “They were faster than us, they were more ready. That’s the way they game played out. It’s concerning for any time of year when you don’t play a game that you’re proud of, so it was not a good showing.”\nThe Canadiens, who missed the playoffs for three consecutive seasons after making it to the Stanley Cup Final in 2021 amidst COVID-19 restrictions, are now fueled by the renewed support of their fans. Winger Josh Anderson shared his feelings on the renewed energy, stating, “Seeing the support of the crowd, it gives you goosebumps. It makes you want to play in the playoffs so bad. It’s been a tough three years they’ve patiently waited.”\nThe Canadiens’ victory over the Senators not only halted Ottawa’s six-game winning streak but also placed them four points behind the Senators in the race for the top wild-card spot in the East. After their Thursday game against the Islanders, the Canadiens will face the Colorado Avalanche at home before embarking on a four-game road trip, stopping at St. Louis, Philadelphia, Carolina, and Florida. This journey will test their mettle and possibly determine their playoff fate.",
