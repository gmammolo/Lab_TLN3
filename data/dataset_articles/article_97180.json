  "text": "Arkansas basketball received a major boost heading into the NCAA Tournament with the return of freshman point guard Boogie Fland. The former five-star recruit has been medically cleared to participate in basketball activities after missing 15 games with a right thumb injury. His return comes just in time for the 10th-seeded Razorbacks (20-13) as they prepare to face No. 7 Kansas in the tournament’s opening round. Head coach John Calipari expressed both excitement and uncertainty regarding Fland’s potential impact. While he acknowledged the freshman’s talent, he remained cautious about the level of contribution Fland could make after such a long absence. © Nelson Chenault-Imagn Images Fland underwent surgery on Jan. 22 to repair his Ulnar Collateral Ligament (UCL) after playing through injury for two additional games. Initially suffering the setback in a Jan. 11 loss to Florida, the freshman guard last played on Jan. 18 before being shut down for the remainder of the regular season. Surprisingly, Fland’s absence did not derail Arkansas’ progress. In fact, the Razorbacks posted a solid 8-5 record without him after starting 0-5 in SEC play with him on the court. His replacement, fellow freshman D.J. Wagner, stepped up as the team’s primary ball-handler, averaging 11.1 points and 3.5 assists per game. Additionally, Karter Knox and Billy Richmond III flourished with increased minutes, proving their worth as elite recruits. Arkansas also found stability in its frontcourt. Zvonimir Ivisic, Trevon Brazile, and Jonas Aidoo each stepped up at different times, contributing through scoring, defense, and rebounding. The team as a whole became more efficient, with improved ball movement and better role distribution. Nelson Chenault-Imagn Images Now that Fland is back, the biggest question is whether he will enhance the Razorbacks' chances against Kansas or inadvertently disrupt the chemistry that has developed in his absence. Calipari is taking a cautious approach. “If you asked me, ‘Will he play more than 15 minutes?’ I don’t know. Maybe less,” the coach said. “But I know he’s talented. For our team, come in and defend and rebound, make easy plays, fly up and down the court, make the plays and be who you are.” Fland’s individual skill set is undeniable—he averaged 15.1 points, 5.7 assists, and 3.4 rebounds before his injury. However, his style of play, which involves dominating the ball and creating his own shot, may not align seamlessly with the team’s newfound rhythm. With Wagner, Knox, and Richmond stepping up in his absence, reintegrating Fland will require careful balance. Maria Lysaker-Imagn Images One undeniable advantage of Fland’s return is the depth it provides. Arkansas has relied on a tight rotation, and foul trouble or off nights from key players have sometimes put them at a disadvantage. Having another high-level player available could give the Razorbacks more flexibility against a talented Kansas squad. “I grabbed the team and said, ‘It’s not really changing anybody’s role or what’s going on, we just have an eighth man,’” Calipari explained. “Instead of having seven, having foul trouble or having two or three guys not playing well, which is normal stuff, now you have a little bit of breathing room.” For Fland, his biggest priority is ensuring that his return helps rather than hinders the team. “I don’t want to screw them up. I just want to help,” he told Calipari. Arkansas will face Kansas on Thursday at 6:10 p.m. Central in Providence, R.I. While Fland’s exact role remains uncertain, his return adds intrigue to the matchup. If he can provide defensive intensity, distribute effectively, and ease back into the offense without disrupting Arkansas’ flow, he could become a key asset in the Razorbacks’ March Madness run. Whether Fland’s return is the spark Arkansas needs or an unexpected challenge remains to be seen. Either way, his presence on the court gives the Razorbacks an added layer of unpredictability—something that could work in their favor on college basketball’s biggest stage.",
