  "text": "Entering the 2025 NFL Draft process, Alabama Crimson Tide quarterback Jalen Milroe is emerging as a compelling prospect at his position. In what is considered a relatively weak quarterback class, Milroe could see his stock rise as teams take notice of his potential. Remarkably, Milroe has already attracted the attention of a quarterback-needy organization, one that may be eager to select the Alabama standout in the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft. In fact, Milroe had a dinner meeting with Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin, general manager Omar Khan, and quarterbacks coach Tom Arth ahead of his impressive pro day performance in Tuscaloosa. Draft analysts have highlighted Milroe’s elite athleticism and cannon arm, traits that could easily translate to success at the NFL level. However, concerns remain about his consistency as a passer, particularly with his accuracy on short to intermediate throws, which could impact his transition to the professional game. Nathan Ray Seebeck-Imagn Images Despite the concerns surrounding Milroe's game at the NFL level, his upside is undeniable. During his college career, Milroe was a dual-threat nightmare for opposing defenses. Few quarterbacks in the nation were as dangerous as the Crimson Tide signal-caller when he had the ball in his hands, showcasing both his playmaking ability and explosive athleticism. In 22 starts during his collegiate career, Milroe posted an impressive 22-6 overall record, accounting for 78 total touchdowns both through the air and on the ground. Remarkably, he crossed the goal line 20 times with his legs in the 2024 season alone. Could the Steelers pull the trigger on Milroe and hand him the keys to the Pittsburgh offense for years to come? It’s certainly a possibility as we move closer to the 2025 NFL Draft. Related: Alabama Gets Promising Update on 5-Star QB Keelon Russell",
