  "text": "SNOQUALMIE PASS, Wash. – A man who fell nearly 500 feet down a ravine was rescued on Sunday by a Kittitas County Search and Rescue team, and by dispatchers who helped him make a tourniquet out of his helmet straps. According to the Kittitas County Sheriff’s Office, at about 11:39 a.m. on July 6, their 911 dispatch received a 911 text that just read “HELP.” The KCSO said dispatchers worked for an hour and a half to communicate with the 51-year-old Seattle man who had sent the text, and learned he had fallen into a deep ravine along No Name Creek while mountain biking in the area of Little Kachess Lake. Deputies said the man had suffered a debilitating injury in the fall, and was bleeding heavily. KCSO deputies said the man told dispatch he wasn’t able to get to his supplies from where he had fallen, and he appeared to be slipping in and out of consciousness. He sent messages to share with his wife and family if he didn’t survive. KCSO said dispatchers were able to guide the man through fabricating a tourniquet using the straps of his bicycle helmet. While dispatch was on the phone with the man, Kittitas Search and Rescue teams were on the way to him. However, it was determined that it would take a rope team hours to reach the man, and he needed assistance much sooner. A helicopter from the King County Sheriff’s Office was flown out to the area and hoisted the man to safety. He was taken to Harborview Hospital in Seattle to be treated for his injuries. KCSO officials thanked search and rescue personnel for coming out on the holiday weekend to help, and the King County Sheriff’s Office for sending a helicopter to help out in the steep terrain. ​COPYRIGHT 2025 BY APPLE VALLEY NEWS NOW.
