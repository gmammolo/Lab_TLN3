  "text": "After struggling to carve out a role in the NBA, Kris Dunn has found his footing on the Los Angeles Clippers and is playing meaningful basketball.\nIn the NBA, the Most Improved Player Award has lost most of its meaning. In recent years, it has been given to Ja Morant, Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, and Lauri Markkanen. All of those players were selected in the draft lottery and were more or less expected to be stars.\nThis year, former first overall pick Cade Cunningham is the frontrunner to win the George Mikan Trophy, further sullying the long-standing point of the award: to celebrate a player who has exceeded expectations.\nFans would argue that Norman Powell , who improved from a solid role-player to a borderline All-Star in his age-31 season, should win the award. The Los Angeles Clippers ’ franchise would likely agree, and in fact, the Clippers have another breakout player who has long been overlooked.\nPhoto by Steph Chambers/Getty Images Kris Dunn is finally playing winning basketball on a good Clippers team After being selected fifth overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2016, Kris Dunn quickly emerged as a solid perimeter defender, but he was unable to make much of an offensive impact, prompting him to be traded to the Chicago Bulls in his first NBA offseason.\nDunn has bounced around the league since then, never really cobbling together a great season on a good team. Seemingly near the end of his NBA career, he signed a three-year contract with the Utah Jazz this summer before being traded to the Clippers, and many expected him to fizzle out.\nInstead, he is averaging six points, three assists, and 3.5 rebounds on a solid team, starting more often than not.\nHe is far from being a star, but Dunn has been the best defender on the team when Kawhi Leonard doesn’t play and is a big reason why the Clippers are alive in the playoff hunt despite low expectations entering the season.\nLou Williams praised Kris Dunn’s effort Picked 45th overall in 2005, Lou Williams knows a thing or two about working his way up. A three-time Sixth Man of the Year, he had the best stretch of his career with the Clippers. He and Dunn both spent time with the Atlanta Hawks during the 2020-21 season.\n“They have a lot of different pieces,” said Williams of this season’s Clippers. “Listen, I want to show some love to Kris Dunn as well. For somebody who’s always tried, been trying to find a home in his NBA career, this looks good on him with the Clippers.”\nDunn isn’t much of a scorer, but he commands respect thanks to his ability to get to the rim and kick the ball out to the open man.\n“He’s aggressive on the defensive end,” Williams continued. “He’s knocking down shots. He’s turned into a viable three and D guy for the Clippers. They got a lot of great pieces, they are peaking at the right time, they got a great identity, and they’re moving forward.”\nThe Clippers are 6-1 in their last seven games . Dunn hasn’t been shooting the lights out, going 21.4% from deep, but he remains a high-level defender and secondary facilitator. The Clippers are the eighth seed in the West and are expected to face either the Oklahoma City Thunder or Houston Rockets in the first round if everything holds.\nDunn’s offensive shortcomings will keep him from playing a massive role for the Clippers in the postseason, but he could be tasked with guarding Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who has been mostly contained so far against the Clippers this season.",
