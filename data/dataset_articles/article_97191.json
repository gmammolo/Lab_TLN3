  "text": "Nick Kyrgios has advanced to the Miami Open second round with his first singles win since October 2022.\nThe Australian fought back to beat Mackenzie McDonald 3-6 6-3 6-4 following various injury struggles in recent years.\nPrior to Wednesday's victory, Kyrgios last won in October 2022 when he beat Kamil Majchrzak in the second round of the Japan Open.\nHe was set to face Taylor Fritz in the quarter-finals but withdrew with a knee problem, which came before a challenging 2023.\nKyrgios suffered an ankle issue ahead of injuries to his knee and wrist, both of which required surgery.\nThe 29-year-old then announced his return to the tour in November and has finally got back to winning ways at the Miami Open.\n\"It's been a long journey, even to just get to the start line of matches and be scared to even be able to finish them,\" he said after.\n\"But to come off and get a win, and then feel like I belong again, it's pretty special.\"\nKyrgios made his return to the court at the World Tennis League in December before appearing at the Brisbane International.\nHe then entered the Australian Open with a protected ranking but lost 6-7 [3-7] 3-6 6-7 [2-7] against Jacob Fearnley in the first round.\n\"Realistically I can't really see myself probably playing singles again here,\" he reflected during his post-match press conference.\nKyrgios made another appearance with a protected ranking when he travelled to Indian Wells earlier this month.\nBotic van de Zandschulp won 7-6 [9-7] in the opening set of their first round clash and led 3-0 in the second before Kyrgios retired.\nHe was in visible discomfort whilst holding his wrist during a practice session the day before and broke into tears at the end of the match.\n\"I wasn't too confident that I was going to be able to play today, to be honest,\" he said afterwards.\n\"Two days ago in practice I had to stop my practice because I felt pain in my wrist. I felt like it was okay to take the court.\n\"Just got progressively worse... Started feeling sharp pain in my wrist.\"\nKyrgios faces Karen Khachanov in the next round of the Miami Open, a tournament he has reached the semi-finals of on two occasions.",
