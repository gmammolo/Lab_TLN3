  "text": "Billy Horschel is loving every minute of the TGL playoffs. He recently sat down with the press to speak on what makes the TGL experience so unique and enjoyable. “I think when you have teammates it makes it easier that you can rely on one another,” he said, a huge grin spreading across his face. “You don’t have to do it all on your own.”\nThat sense of friendship and respect for each other is a major factor in the TGL’s relaxed atmosphere. Horschel’s teammates become an extension of himself, allowing him to enjoy the game even more. And it’s not just Horschel who’s benefiting – the PGA Tour and Jay Monahan are also taking note.\nBut what really sets the TGL apart is its ability to go out of the box (or indoors, in this case). For Horschel, he has said it “multiple times, listen, this is awesome, this is such a new venture that we’re stepping into,” in a recent press conference. “But at the end of the day this isn’t, we’re not, this isn’t our regular job in the sense of financially and everything going.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nThe TGL playoffs offer the perfect setup for players to be themselves and have fun on the course. And let’s be real, playoffs are always a blast! LIV Golf has been killing it in this department, and the TGL follows. “I think it’s a perfect setup that you can show a little bit more of who you are on the golf course,” Horschel said, nodding in agreement.\nIt’s clear that Horschel is thriving in this new format. He’s more relaxed, more himself, and more enjoyable to watch. “Obviously I do a better job of that here than out on the golf course,” he said, chuckling. “I can be a little more focused and probably a little more hot under the collar (laughing). But here I just seem to enjoy it more.”\nThis was on full display during the TGL semifinals, where Billy Horschel’s hilarious reaction to Justin Thomas‘ freak shot will be etched in memory for a long time.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nBilly Horschel’s priceless reaction helps Atlanta advance to the TGL finals\nWhat. A. Moment! Billy Horschel was left gobsmacked when Justin Thomas‘ shanked shot took a crazy bounce and somehow stayed in play! The crowd at the SoFi Center was in hysterics, and Horschel’s teammates were cracking up. We mean, who wouldn’t be? It was one of those “you’ve got to be kidding me” moments!\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nIs TGL's team spirit the secret sauce that PGA Tour has been missing all along?\nHave an interesting take?\nBut in all seriousness, Horschel’s post-match comments highlighted just how important teamwork has been for Atlanta’s success. “When you’ve got teammates, you can rely on each other… you don’t have to do it all on your own,” he said. And boy, did they ever rely on each other! Thomas, Horschel, and Patrick Cantlay absolutely dominated their opponents, securing a 9-3 win. Now, they’re headed to the finals against New York, with a whopping $9 million jackpot on the line!\nThomas knows it won’t be a cakewalk, though. “New York’s starting to play well at the right time,” he said. But Cantlay’s feeling confident, saying, “Our team’s played well every match…we’ll take that into next week and I think we’re all excited for the final.” So, can they bring home the title? Let us know what you think in the comments!\nHave something to say?\nLet the world know your perspective.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDebate\nIs TGL's team spirit the secret sauce that PGA Tour has been missing all along?\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT",
