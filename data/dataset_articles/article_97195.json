  "text": "The men’s basketball program at Texas Tech has dreams of dancing in March. With a Vallejo native on the roster, the Red Raiders have as good a chance as anyone.\nJesse Bethel High School 2019 graduate Chance McMillian — who also played high school basketball with St. Patrick-St. Vincent — will compete in March Madness for the fourth and final time when Texas Tech plays UNC Wilmington on Thursday night at 7:10 p.m. on truTV.\nTexas Tech, the No. 3 seed in the West side of the bracket, is 25-8 this year. After winning four in a row, the Red Raiders lost the Big-12 championship last weekend to Arizona.\nNow all McMillian wants is to win some games in the NCAA tournament.\nIn 2021, McMillian became the first player coached by both Dwayne Jones (ex-Bethel and Hogan) and Derek Walker (St. Pat’s) to compete in March Madness.\nFormer Vallejo High and current Elite High head coach Duke Brown said in 2021 that he believed McMillian to be the first men’s player from Vallejo to be on a team in the men’s tournament since DeMarcus Nelson played in games for Duke from 2005 through 2008. Nelson, who is in the Vallejo Sports Hall of Fame, played for Vallejo before transferring to Sheldon of Sacramento. He later saw time in the NBA including a stint with the Golden State Warriors.\nBethel’s Chance McMillian elevates to the hoop for two of his 32 points in the Jaguars’ 78-71 win over Rodriguez in 2019 .(Chris Riley–Times-Herald File) In a 2021 first-round loss to Iowa McMillian didn’t see much action, but had two rebounds and an assist. He appeared to have scored a basket near the end of the first half, but the shot didn’t beat the 30-second shot clock by about half a second.\nIn 2023 McMillian was back in the tournament with Grand Canyon and had a bigger role, although in another first-round loss, this time to Gonzaga. He played 38 minutes and scored 16 points and added four rebounds, four assists and one steal.\nThe next season McMillian transferred to Texas Tech. McMillian said that year he felt he’s was learning to play with more force.\n“I am a lot more physical now,” McMillian said in 2024. “I had to adapt to that especially playing in the Big 12. I feel that is the one area I improved my game on for than any.”\nHowever, the end result his junior year was another first-round loss. McMillian came off the bench but played the fourth-most minutes on the team with 31. He scored eight points on 4-for-9 shooting and added two rebounds and two steals.\nThis year McMillian’s role has grown again. He’s played in 31 games and is averaging 14.2 points a game, third overall on the Red Raiders. He’s also grabbed four rebounds and 1.9 assists and 0.7 steals a game.\nMcMillian has dealt with an upper body injury lately, but earlier this week Texas Tech head coach Grant McCasland said he expects to have “everybody playing” in its first-round matchup.\nMcMillian was unable to respond to numerous phone calls and texts as of press time on Wednesday.",
