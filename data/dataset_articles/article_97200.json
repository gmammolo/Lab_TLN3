  "text": "Manchester United star Casemiro leads Europe in a key metric, suggesting he still has something to offer the club under Ruben Amorim.\nSpeculation over Casemiro’s future has been rife, amidst suggestions that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS are desperate to offload him and get his hefty £350,000 per week wages off the books.\nDuring the January transfer window, it appeared like a move to Saudi Arabia was set to happen but it didn’t materialise and the Brazilian ended up staying at Old Trafford.\nHe has since insisted more than once that his wish is to see out his contract, which expires in the summer of 2026.\nA report covered by The Peoples Person relayed that Casemiro will only move to a club that matches his salary as he is not willing to give up even a penny.\nAmidst the spate of injuries the Red Devils are dealing with, Casemiro has seen his playing time dramatically improve. In the early stages of Amorim’s spell, the five-time Champions League winner was at the bottom of the pecking order but he is now a regular presence in the team.\nCasemiro started both legs of United’s Europa League triumph over Real Sociedad and also came off the bench for the last 20 or so minutes of last weekend’s 3-0 victory over Leicester City. At the King Power Stadium, his superb long pass to Diogo Dalot created the opportunity for the defender to assist Bruno Fernandes for United’s third goal of the night.\nNow statisticians Squawka have revealed that Casemiro is averaging more tackles per 90 minutes than any other player across Europe’s top five leagues this season.\nThe 33-year-old is making an impressive 4.97 tackles per 90 minutes. Bournemouth’s Tyler Adams ranks second with 4.56 tackles made per 90. Everton man Idrissa Gana Gueye rounds up the top three with 4.36 tackles per 90.\nCasemiro’s teammate, Manuel Ugarte, is fourth on the list with 4.2 tackles per 90.\nMost tackles per 90 in Europe’s top five leagues this season. pic.twitter.com/93HHInKbn0\n— Squawka (@Squawka) March 18, 2025\nDespite a noticeable decline in his speed and physicality, Casemiro continues to demonstrate his ability to make a positive impact for United.\nIn addition to his wealth of experience, he is still a solid disruptor and defensive stalwart in the middle of the park.\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images",
