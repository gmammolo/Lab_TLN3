You might have missed it in the global telecast, but attendees at the Major League Baseball (MLB) Tokyo Series opener between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs saw players introduced with accompanying visuals of Mega Poké mon. For example, the Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani and Tommy Edman were introduced as Mega Garchomp (Gaburias in Japanese) and Mega Sharpedo (Samehader), respectively. Similarly, Cubs right fielder Kyle Tucker was Mega Houndoom (Hellgar).\nMLB東京シリーズ\nそれぞれの選手にメガシンカポケモンがあてられています。 pic.twitter.com/tbGOpaxABs\n— 青味噌 (@Aomiso97) March 18, 2025 MLB Tokyo Series\nEach player is assigned a Mega Evolution Pokémon .\nシカゴカブスの登場シーン\nシロナ戦のBGMのアレンジです。 pic.twitter.com/h3ekolMZRV\n— 青味噌 (@Aomiso97) March 18, 2025 Chicago Cubs intro scene\nThis is an arrangement of the background music for the battle against Cynthia.\nThe player introduction ceremony also featured a child in a baseball uniform holding a Pokéball on the pitcher's mound. MLB posted the full Pokémon -themed player introduction ceremony, Pikachu mascots and all:\nFans of Pokémon and baseball have noted the similarities between Garchomp and Ohtani's stats for years. X (formerly Twitter ) user @5CRubmZm9w971 posted an image of a pair of Ohtani and Garchomp pop-up stands at a store last year. As the stands' captions half-jokingly note, the two are nearly identical in height, weight, two-way playing style, and unstoppability once they appear.\n速報！ 大谷翔平さんはガブリアスとほぼ同じ pic.twitter.com/i1OeAQdlkk\n— こういうの瞬電って言うんだぜ (@5CRubmZm9w971) September 7, 2024 Breaking news!

The MLB posted videos just after their performances. YOSHIKI has performed the national anthem for several Dodgers games in the past.\nYoshiki's incredible National Anthem performances at the #TokyoSeries 🇺🇸🇯🇵 pic.twitter.com/lqxLul5vdz\n— MLB (@MLB) March 18, 2025 The Dodgers beat the Cubs in both games of the series, winning 4 to 1 on Tuesday and 6 to 3 on Wednesday.\nSources: MLBs X/ Twitter account ( link 2 ), Aomiso's X/ Twitter account ( link 2 ) and @5CRubmZm9w971's X/ Twitter account via Hachima Kikō",
