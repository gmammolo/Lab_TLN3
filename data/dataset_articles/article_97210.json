  "text": "|\nContact: pressroom@vortexoptics.com\nBARNEVELD, WI - Three new riflescope accessories from Vortex® help hunters and shooters of every level wring every\nlast bit of accuracy out of their firearms.\nPRO TORQUE WRENCH AND PRO LEVELING KIT PUT PRECISION ON YOUR WORKBENCH.\nTwo new tools take the guesswork out of accurately mounting your riflescope.\nThe Pro Torque Wrench provides precise torque from 10 to 90 in-lbs, helping you avoid over- and under-torquing of riflescope rings and mounts, bolts, and rifle action screws. With 13 bits, and the ability to be recalibrated, it’s an essential tool that will be a part of your workbench for years to come.\nShooters and hunters can guarantee a properly aligned riflescope with the Pro Leveling Kit. Two levels achieve perfect elevation and drop adjustments by eliminating the many variables that lead to crosshairs that are not plumb and square.\nSPORT CANTILEVER MOUNT: SOLID. VERSATILE. FOR THE FIRST SHOT AND BEYOND.\nWeighing in at less than six ounces, the Sport Cantilever Mount creates a powerful connection between your rifle and optic without weighing you down. Even better, the mount’s short base means you can move it on your rail, freeing up more space for additional accessories.\nThe Sport Cantilever Mount also works as a 2\" offset, making it simple to get the correct head positioning and eye relief for comfortable, accurate shot placement.\nMAP $149.99 | MSRP $224.99\nMAP $29.99 | MSRP $44.99\nSport Cantilever Mount (1\" and 30 mm.)\nMAP $119.99 | MSRP $179.99\nFor a detailed list of technical specifications, frequently asked questions, and high-resolution images, check out the Vortex® New Product Portal.\nTo see more from Vortex®, visit VortexOptics.com or follow us on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and X.\nAbout Vortex®: Your desire to be your best fuels our promise to provide nothing short of exceptional performance, unmatched service, and memorable experiences.
