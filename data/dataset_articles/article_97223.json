  "text": "Wilson reaches Players Championship semi-finals\n- Published\nWorld champion Kyren Wilson progressed to the semi-finals of the Players Championship in Telford with a 6-3 win against Mark Williams.\nThe world number two raced into a 2-0 lead but a risky shot allowed Williams to get off the mark, before a break of 68 levelled the match.\nThe two continued to battle by taking a frame each but breaks of 61, 79 and 71 ensured Wilson took the next three frames to win.\n\"Mark's so good you can't allow him into a match and at 2-0 I should have gone into the interval at least 3-1 up,\" Wilson told ITV4.\n\"If anything, Mark probably felt he won that little mini-session to go 2-2 so it was about resetting, going into the practice room, hitting a few balls and I came out and won the next frame to go 3-2 and it set me back on the right path.\"\nWilson will next play either Mark Selby or Neil Robertson in the last four.\nMeanwhile, China's Xiao Guodong beat compatriot Wu Yize 6-5 in the first round and will next face a quarter-final against John Higgins, who beat Chris Wakelin 6-5.",
