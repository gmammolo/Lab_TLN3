  "text": "South Korea will aim to strengthen their grip on top spot in Group B of AFC World Cup qualifying when they welcome Oman to Goyang Stadium on Thursday for their seventh match of the campaign.\nThe Taeguk Warriors were left frustrated in their last outing, settling for a 1-1 draw against Palestine on November 19, yet they still lead the standings with 14 points. Meanwhile, Oman suffered a narrow 1-0 defeat to Iraq on the same date, leaving them in fourth place with six points, still within reach of a fourth-round spot.\nSouth Korea have been a tough nut to crack, recording four wins and a draw in six matches, though their 12-goal tally suggests they've been more pragmatic than prolific. Their recent stalemate with Palestine in Jordan proved they can grind out results, but they'll look to return to winning ways against an Omani side still battling for progression.\nOman have two victories and four defeats to their name, with wins over Palestine and Kuwait keeping them in the mix. However, they'll need to improve on their 3-1 home defeat to South Korea in the reverse fixture if they hope to cause an upset.\nHere, GOAL brings you everything you need to know about how to watch, including TV channel, streaming details and more.\nHow to watch South Korea vs Oman online - TV channels & live streams The AFC World Cup qualifier match between South Korea and Oman will be shown live on Fubo , Fanatiz and beIN Sports Connect in the US .
