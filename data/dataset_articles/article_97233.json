  "text": "Cooper Rush sends farewell to Cowboys with emotional message, video\nFormer Dallas backup quarterback Cooper Rush penned an emotional farewell to the franchise on Wednesday evening. He wrote the message on his Instagram page. “From an undrafted rookie wearing No. 7 to an eight year veteran wearing No. 10, I appreciated every moment in a Cowboys uniform. Thank you Dallas for all of the love that you showed to me and family. I’m excited for the next chapter but forever grateful for the first one,” Rush wrote on his personal account.\nRush recently signed a two-year deal with the Baltimore Ravens, meaning his time with the Dallas Cowboys has come to an end for now.",
