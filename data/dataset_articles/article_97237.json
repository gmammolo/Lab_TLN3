  "text": "Classroom Champions: Reicher’s TJ Bradley\nWACO, Texas (KWTX) - Bishop Reicher’s TJ Bradley is a true multi-sport athlete.\nOver the course of his athletic career, he’s been named All-District in football and baseball, and basketball. He was also selected to the All-State basketball team and even set the Reicher school record for points scored.\nWhen I play sports, I kind of get to think and be strategic about it,” said Bradley. “You got to pick up on your opponent’s weaknesses, what they’re good at and try to outplay them. I think that’s something I’ve always been drawn towards.”\nThat drive and competitiveness carries over to the classroom, though, it hasn’t always been a breeze.\nTJ is dyslexic, yet, he carries a 4.45 GPA. He says staying active has helped him the most.\n“I like being active, it goes hand in hand with my learning style,” said Bradley. “I’m very much an active learner and I like to be doing things. I have to fidget and I have to be moving.”\nTJ is on track to graduate as class salutatorian. He’s looking forward to studying engineering at his dream school down in College Station.\n“I’ve always wanted to, since I was probably like five, go to A&M,” said Bradley. “Knowing that in high school, A&M’s automatic acceptance is top 10 percent. I know it’s a difficult school to get into. If I do well in school, I get to go to A&M and I get to follow in the lineage of my parents.”\nBefore he heads off to Texas A&M, TJ says he’s most focused on growing in his faith. It’s the most important part of his life.\n“I’ve noticed that I’ve grown deeper in love,” said Bradley. “When things go wrong, I can kind of just be like, ‘Hey Jesus, this is how I’m feeling, I don’t really understand why things are like this, I’m kind of stressed out. I need your help to calm down and focus on you and put what is stressing me behind.”\nCongratulations to TJ Bradley, you’re a Classroom Champion!\nCopyright 2025 KWTX. All rights reserved.",
