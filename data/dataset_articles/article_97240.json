  "text": "In North Dakota 1976 school consolidation hadn’t begun to change the landscape of competition. Today entire counties and “Areas” compete as a single team. Even in the 1990s there were massive sports co-ops and towns such as Mayville-Portland-Clifford-Galesburg were one team with four towns.\nIn 1975 Fullerton defeated LaMoure in the Region title game. LaMoure was 19 miles away. 1976 Edgeley was the only team to stay within 10 points of LaMoure. Combine these two or three teams? Not in the 1970s it wasn’t needed.\nIt’s with that foundation I lay the claim the 1976 LaMoure basketball team was the best ever. Period. They won with their own players. One town. One team. The following details will help you understand why.\nThree teams entered the state tournament undefeated. Three. Not just one or two. LaMoure was one. They crushed the other two.\nLaMoure set a record 252 points in 3 games. Do the math. (84 points/game and there was no 3 point shot)\nThey didn’t just beat the opponents in the State Tournament. They won all three by 24+ points.\nI’ll tip my hat to a great segment part of One Shining Moment from Prairie Public a few years back you’ll enjoy which dug into the question: Which team is the best ever from North Dakota Class Basketball? LaMoure.\n(Doug Leier 2018)",
