  "text": "President John Dramani Mahama made a surprise visit to the Black Stars at their training session at the Accra Sports Stadium on Wednesday ahead of their crucial 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Chad and Madagascar.\nAddressing the players and technical team, President Mahama acknowledged the team’s recent struggles but expressed faith in their ability to reverse the situation\n“We didn’t qualify for the AFCON. But even when we qualified for the AFCON, we crashed out very early the last time. And so we haven’t given up on you.\n“We still believe that the Black Stars can find its glory again. And it’s dependent on you, the technical team, and the management committee.” he noted\nThe President also reminded the players that while the nation stands behind them, their success ultimately depends on their commitment and effort on the pitch.\n“The goals will come from these feet that are right here. And so it takes sacrifice. It takes strength. We all like to watch you when you play for your teams, and we expect that you bring some of that dedication to the national team.” he said.\nThe Black Stars are set to face Chad on March 21 before playing Madagascar three days later in Morocco as they aim to keep their World Cup qualification hopes alive.",
