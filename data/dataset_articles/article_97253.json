  "text": "Image: Taika Waititi as The Viscount in FING! courtesy of King Bert Productions and Story Brdge Films\nProduction has commenced at Screen Queensland Studios, Brisbane on King Bert Productions and Story Bridge Films' screen adaptation of David Walliams best-selling children's book FING!\nSecured through Screen Queensland's Production Attraction Strategy, the live action family film stars Academy Award winner Taika Waititi (Time Bandits, Our Flag Means Death), Mia Wasikowska (Alice in Wonderland), Blake Harrison (World on Fire), David Walliams (Little Britain), Penelope Wilton (Downton Abbey) and Richard Roxburgh (Elvis, Prosper), alongside newcomer Iona Bell.\nThe film is co-written by BAFTA award winner Walliams and Emmy award winner Kevin Celil (Veep), with Queensland's multi-award-winning director Jeffrey Walker (Apple Cider Vinegar, The Portable Door) at the helm.\nFING! is an official Australian/UK co-production led by Jo Sargent from London-based King Bert Productions and Todd Fellman from Queensland's Story Bridge Films.\nArts Minister John-Paul Langbroek said that with the support of the Crisafulli Government, 2025 is shaping up to be a bumper year for screen production in Queensland.\n\"David Walliams' FING! is beloved by children around the world, and it's incredible to see our Production Attraction Strategy supporting renowned Queensland creatives as they bring it to life on the big screen.\n\"FING! joins recent blockbuster announcements including Voltron, Anaconda and Bluey, which really demonstrates Queensland's growing reputation as a global film and animation powerhouse.\n\"This film will showcase the skills of our local screen practitioners to an international audience, while contributing about $16 million into the state's economy and employing more than 300 Queenslanders during production.\"\nScreen Queensland CEO Jacqui Feeney said that FING! is another example of Brisbane's Story Bridge Films success with international co-productions, such as 2023's The Portable Door with The Jim Henson Company.\n\"Global partnerships via co-productions are an increasingly vital factor for film and series financing, and we are so pleased to be supporting King Bert Productions and Story Bridge Films to make FING! in Queensland.\n\"As well as access to our talented local artisans and designers, the shoot will benefit from the flexibility of Screen Queensland Studios, Brisbane and its proximity to versatile filming locations.\"\nFING! follows Myrtle Meek (Iona Bell), a spoiled child who demands a \"FING\" despite having everything she could wish for. Her parents (Mia Wasikowska and Blake Harrison) embark on a quest to track one down, taking them to the furthest and darkest corners of the jungle. FING turns out to be as much as a destructive monster as Myrtle, who in turn, must battle it out with the evil animal park owner, The Viscount (Taika Waititi), who is determined to own this rarest of creatures.\nThe film joins a strong slate of Queensland-made productions including Voltron, Anaconda, Spa Weekend and the feature film debut of Brisbane's own Bluey. Recent releases include Black Snow (Season 2), Good Cop/Bad Cop, Nautilus, How to Make Gravy, The Lost Tiger and Spit, while Deadloch (Season 2) wrapped production at Screen Queensland Studios, Brisbane in December.\nEmmy Award-winning producer of FING!, Jo Sargent (Absolutely Fabulous, Malory Towers) said that \"David and I have always known FING! had potential to be an incredibly cinematic story.\n\"Director Jeffrey Walker and co-producer Todd Fellman have shared our vision from day one and it's been wonderful to work alongside their world class crew in Queensland as we create the creature and story we know and love.\"\nStory Bridge Films' Todd Fellman adds, \"The support and infrastructure provided by Screen Queensland has been instrumental in making this film a reality. As a local, it's wonderful to continue to produce large scale feature films in my back yard.\n\"We're shooting at Screen Queensland's Brisbane studios and the facilities are incredible. This combined with the talent of our local crew, provides the perfect platform to create a film of international scale and quality.\"\nStan's Chief Content Officer, Cailah Scobie said that \"Following the success of the Stan Original film, The Portable Door, we are thrilled to reunite with Sky, Jeffrey Walker and Story Bridge Films, along with new partners, King Bert Productions and AGC Studios, to bring David's incredible vision to life.\n\"We were instantly captivated by FING!'s charm and originality. It's a film with universal appeal and we are confident it will resonate with Australian audiences of all ages. We're delighted to be part of the global release.\"\nFING! is an official Australian/UK co-production led by Jo Sargent from London-based King Bert Productions and Todd Fellman from Queensland's Story Bridge Films, with AGC Studios co-financing and handling worldwide sales and distribution. Transmission Films will release theatrically in Australia and New Zealand with Stan premiering as a Stan Original on SVOD. Sky is co-financing and has developed the project in the UK and will premiere the film as a Sky Original on Sky Cinema. Executive producers are David Walliams and Shana Levine together with Andrew Orr for Sky, Cailah Scobie and Alicia Brown for Stan, and Stuart Ford, Miguel Palos, and Aghi Koh for AGC Studios with financing provided by Elevate Media Capital.
