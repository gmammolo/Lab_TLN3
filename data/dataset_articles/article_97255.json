  "text": "The University of Queensland is collaborating with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on a project to combat interpersonal violence in sport in the Pacific Islands.\nUQ will conduct an extensive feasibility study for the IOC's Safe Sport Hub Initiative Initiative to support the subsequent set up of a regional safeguarding hub in the Pacific Islands.\nThe hub will facilitate access to local contextualised support for those experiencing interpersonal or gender-based violence in sport, strengthen localised protection, and improve cooperation and coordination between local sport- and non-sport-based safeguarding systems and services.\nAligning with existing regional initiatives and key IOC initiatives, the hub will play a critical role in protecting and supporting athletes at a local level.\nUQ Vice-Chancellor Professor Deborah Terry AC said she was confident the project would make a difference - not just in the lead up to 2032, but for decades to come.\n\"As an institution, we've considered this to be a Games for Oceania from our initial support for the Brisbane bid,\" Professor Terry said.\n\"This work is wholly consistent with our ongoing commitment to support capacity building, knowledge sharing and collaboration in the region.\"\nDirector of the Queensland Centre for Olympic and Paralympic Studies at UQ, Professor John Cairney , will lead the feasibility study.\n\"The project will be delivered in 3 key phases, including mapping current systems and identifying gaps, designing operational structures and co-development of global blueprints,\" Professor Cairney said.\n\"We look forward to collaborating with the IOC, government agencies and organisations across the Pacific on how to ensure the safest possible environment for athletes.\n\"It is critical that we work alongside and support key partners in the Pacific to ensure a program that is Pacific-led and responsive to the needs of that region.\"\nIOC Associate Director, Health, Medicine and Science, Kirsty Burrows, said a localised approach was essential as the pilot hub would build on existing regional initiatives and leverage local expertise.\n\"The establishment of regional safeguarding hubs marks a pivotal step in our shared mission to combat interpersonal violence both in and through sport,\" Ms Burrows said.\n\"By embedding local knowledge into global blueprints, we create safer sporting environments for all across the entire sports ecosystem - from grassroots to elite level.\n\"This has the potential to strengthen the role of sport as a vehicle for addressing interpersonal and gender-based violence across society.\"\nThe study is in collaboration with Burnet Institute, Victoria University Wellington Te Herenga Waka, and Workforce Blueprint.\nMedia contact\nUQ Communications\n+61 429 056 139\nhere.",
