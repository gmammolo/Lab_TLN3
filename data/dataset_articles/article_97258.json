  "text": "The Washington Capitals’ memorable 2024-25 season continues on Thursday with a matchup against the Philadelphia Flyers at Capital One Arena. And two major team milestones could be reached.\nDepending on the outcome of Thursday night’s games around the NHL, the Capitals could not only become the first team in the NHL to hit 100 points, but could also clinch a playoff spot nearly a month before their season ends on April 17.\nPer Capitals PR, three different scenarios could see the Caps secure a playoff spot Thursday night:\nIf the Capitals beat the Flyers in regulation, they need the Montreal Canadiens to get at least one point over the New York Islanders. If the Capitals win in overtime or a shootout, they need the Islanders to lose in any fashion. If the Capitals lose in overtime or a shootout, they need the Islanders to lose in regulation and the Columbus Blue Jackets to lose to the Florida Panthers in any fashion. Potentially clinching a playoff spot in mid-March is a remarkable turn for the Capitals, who needed a TJ Oshie empty-net goal against the Flyers during game 82 of the regular season to squeak into the playoffs last season. The 2023-24 Caps set the salary cap era record for the worst goal differential to make the postseason at minus-37. They went on to be swept in four games by the New York Rangers.\nAfter adding 7 different players to their starting lineup over the offseason, the Capitals are an Eastern Conference-best plus-72 in goal differential this year, leading the league in goals with 248. They’re tied in standings points with the Winnipeg Jets (98) and are vying for the franchise’s fourth Presidents’ Trophy.\nIf the Capitals can’t clinch on Thursday, they’ll likely do so in the following days. The Capitals would face the Montreal Canadiens in the first round if the playoffs started today — a rematch of the dreaded 2010 Stanley Cup Playoffs .\nThis article has been updated to add additional clinching scenarios.",
