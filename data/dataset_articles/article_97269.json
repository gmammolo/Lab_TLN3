  "text": "MotoAmerica Partners with MiniSBK Canada for 2025 Qualifiers motoamerica, the leading motorcycle road racing series in North America, is expanding its reach by\nhosting two Mini Cup qualifying rounds in Canada. The events, a collaboration with MiniSBK Canada,\nwill take place at Shannonville Motorsports Park in Shannonville, Ontario.\nMark your calendars: the qualifiers are scheduled for June 13-14 and July 4-5 ,\ncoinciding with rounds three and four of the MiniSBK series.This provides a unique chance\nfor young Canadian racers to compete for a coveted spot in the Mission Mini Cup National Final,\nheld annually at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, from August 8-10 .\nShannonville: A Track Steeped in Racing History Shannonville Motorsports park,proudly known as the “Birthplace of Champions As 1974,” brings\nmeaningful prestige to the qualifying rounds. The track is a mainstay in Canadian motorsports,\nregularly hosting a round of the Canadian Superbike Championship. Its history and reputation make\nit an ideal venue for nurturing the next generation of racing talent.\nToni Sharpless: Leading the Charge at MiniSBK canada MiniSBK Canada is helmed by Toni sharpless, a celebrated figure in the racing world. Inducted into\nthe Canadian Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2011, Sharpless is also notable for being one of the few\nwomen to qualify for and finish the prestigious Daytona 200 back in 1987. Her experience and\nleadership promise well for the success of the qualifiers.\nA Pathway to the National Stage These qualifying races offer a direct route for young Canadian racers to participate in the Mission\nMini Cup National Final at Road America. The competition will span six classes, ensuring a wide\nrange of age groups and skill levels are represented:\nClass Age Range Stock 50 6-8 years Stock 110 8-12 years GP 110 8-12 years GP 160 10-14 years GP 190 10-14 years Street GP 14 years and up Quotes from the Top: Aksland and Sharpless on the Partnership MotoAmerica COO Chuck Aksland expressed his enthusiasm for the collaboration, stating:\nMotoAmerica is thrilled to be working with MiniSBK to bring two of our Mini Cup Qualifiers to\nCanada. I guess you could say we’re going international, which is remarkable considering this\nis just our second year of the qualifiers and national Final. Canada has always produced\ntop-level racers, some of whom have won AMA championships, and we’re sure there will be some\nfast kids who make it down for our National final at Road America.\nChuck Aksland, MotoAmerica COO\nToni Sharpless echoed this sentiment, highlighting the importance for Canadian youth:\nI was surprised and honored to receive the call from Wayne Rainey and Chuck Aksland, two\nindividuals I remember from my racing days in the 1980s. When they asked if our MiniSBK\nChampionship series would be interested in joining the MotoAmerica Mini Cup Qualifier series,\nit took me less than a minute to consider and say ‘Yes.’ This connection further expands the\nopportunities we provide for Canadian youth in the sport. We are happy and proud to be part of\nanother big step toward grassroots advancement in road racing.\nToni Sharpless, MiniSBK CEO\nExpanding opportunities for Young Racers This partnership underscores a commitment to fostering young talent in motorcycle racing. By\nextending the MotoAmerica Mini Cup series into Canada, more young racers gain access to\nhigh-quality competition and a pathway to national recognition. This move could perhaps mirror\nthe success of programs like the Red Bull motogp Rookies Cup, which identifies and develops young\ntalent on a global scale, hoping to discover the next Marc Marquez or Valentino Rossi from the\nNorth American continent.\nPotential Challenges and Considerations While the expansion is undoubtedly positive, logistical challenges may arise for Canadian racers\nlooking to compete at Road America. Travel costs, equipment transportation, and potential visa\nrequirements could present obstacles. However,the opportunity to race on a national stage often\noutweighs these concerns for aspiring champions and their families.\nWhat’s Next? As the June qualifiers approach, anticipation is building. This initiative promises to inject fresh\ntalent into the MotoAmerica Mini Cup series and strengthen the ties between the U.S. and Canadian\nracing communities. Keep an eye on Shannonville Motorsports Park this summer for a glimpse of the\nfuture stars of motorcycle racing. The U.S. racing scene is hoping to cultivate talent that can\none day compete with the European dominance in MotoGP, the premier class of motorcycle racing.\n© 2025 archyde.com All rights reserved.\nWhat are the different age groups and class categories for the MotoAmerica Mini cup qualifiers hosted by MiniSBK Canada?\nArchyde Interviews Toni Sharpless on MotoAmerica Mini Cup Canada Published: March 19, 2025\nArchyde News recently sat down with Toni Sharpless, CEO of MiniSBK Canada, to discuss the exciting new partnership with MotoAmerica for the Mini Cup series.\nInterview with Toni sharpless Archyde: Toni, thank you for joining us.
