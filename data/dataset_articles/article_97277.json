  "text": "The Kansas City Chiefs re-signed DL Marlon Tuipulotu , according to Aaron Wilson .\nTuipulotu, 25, was a sixth-round pick by the Eagles out of USC back in the 2021 NFL Draft.\nHe made it onto the active roster as a rookie and appeared in five games. The following season he appeared in nine games before winding up on injured reserve in November 2022 due to a torn meniscus.\nTuipulotu was among the Eagles final roster cuts this offseason and he signed with the Chiefs practice squad just two days after being released.\nHe is the older brother of Chargers LB Tuli Tuipulotu and the cousin of 49ers S Talanoa Hufanga .\nIn 2024, Tuipulotu appeared in two games for the Chiefs and recorded four tackles and one tackle for loss.",
