  "text": "ST. LOUIS–Mayor Cara Spencer announced a $19.2 million spending plan aimed at helping residents recover from the May 16 tornado. The plan includes money for home repairs, temporary housing and rent assistance, mental health services and funding for resource hubs.\nThe funding package includes $18 million from interest accumulated from the Rams settlement fund and $1.2 million from Community Development Block Grant funds. The funds are divided across several areas aimed to address immediate and emerging recovery needs.\n“Our plan allows us to spend these funds where the need is greatest and in ways that won't overlap with what our partners at FEMA and at the state level are doing,” Spencer said. “This is just the start as we build a long-term plan.”\nFunds will provide: $2.5 million for resource hubs (including meals, supplies)\n$2.2 million for unmet needs (storage, rental assistance, temporary housing)\n$5 million for home repairs for un/underinsured\n$3.5 million for case management, mental health, and legal services.\n$1 million to provide cooling through water stations and water sprinklers.\nUp to $5 million for non-profit support\nThe mayor also announced a new Tornado Recovery Office to coordinate long-term rebuilding efforts. It will be based in the mayor’s office and led by Julian Nicks, previous interim deputy chief operating officer.\n“The priorities we envision include supporting impacted residents, ensuring they stabilize their lives, stay in St. Louis and recover,” Spencer said. “This office will also lead our community engagement efforts to shape our recovery vision and refine our priorities.”\nResidents can also expect new debris removal efforts starting next week. Utility trucks will begin in North St. Louis, moving south through a grid-based approach. Residents should still leave debris on curbs for collection.\nMayor Spencer says environmental inspectors will visually assess debris piles and separate asbestos and potentially hazardous materials for disposal. Hauling monitors will be stationed at intersections to document and catalogue debris removal to maximize FEMA reimbursement potential.\n“Debris removal is going to be an enormous undertaking and enormously expensive,” Spencer said. “We expect this phase to last between 4 and 6 weeks, but we do intend to have a long term third phase ready to go before the end of this.”\nThe proposal is expected to go before the City’s Board of Estimate and Apportionment at a special meeting next week. If approved, city officials say the funding will be distributed and programs implemented next month.",
