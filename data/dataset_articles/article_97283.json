  "text": "Carl Lewis, nine-time Olympic gold medalist and University of Houston alumnus, has been named Grand Marshal for the 2025 Houston Art Car Parade , the Orange Show Center for Visionary Art announced in a press release. The parade rolls through downtown Houston on Saturday, April 12. A track and field legend, Lewis is among the most decorated athletes in history, having competed in multiple Olympic Games. Now serving as head coach of the University of Houston’s track and field program, he continues to shape the city’s athletic legacy. “As a car enthusiast, I’ve always appreciated the creativity and artistry that goes into these incredible vehicles,” said Lewis. “The Art Car Parade represents the unique spirit of Houston that I’ve come to know and love. I can’t wait to lead this iconic Houston event that celebrates both art and car culture.” One of Houston’s most anticipated events, the Art Car Parade features more than 250 rolling works of art and draws nearly 400,000 spectators. MORE FROM ANA KHAN: 22 Houston-area spring festivals celebrating food, music and art Executive Director Jack Massing highlighted Lewis' connection to the city and the event. “Having Carl Lewis as our Grand Marshal brings together two Houston treasures: our world-renowned Art Car Parade and one of the greatest athletes in history who has strong ties to our city. Carl’s presence will add an extraordinary element to this year’s parade, and we’re honored to have him lead this celebration of creativity and community.” Lewis joins past Grand Marshals such as Bun B, J.J. Watt, Marilyn Oshman, Dan Aykroyd and George Clinton. The 38th Annual Houston Art Car Parade Weekend kicks off Thursday, April 10, with a Sneak Peek at Discovery Green, followed by the Legendary Art Car Ball on Friday, April 11. The main event takes place Saturday, April 12, as the parade winds through the city with its fleet of uniquely decorated vehicles.
