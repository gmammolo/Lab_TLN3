  "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers seem to be on the mend after going winless on a four-game road trip just days ago. They have gotten some of their injured players back, and they have won two games in a row as they go for a third consecutive win on Wednesday against the Denver Nuggets . The Lakers have lost 14 of their last 16 games to the Nuggets, but they will have to get the job done this time without LeBron James and Rui Hachimura, both of whom are still out due to injury. Luckily, both may be on the mend. Lakers insider Jovan Buha wrote that both starting forwards could return to game action very soon. Via The Athletic : “But while the results haven’t always been there, the Lakers are trusting their new offensive process,” Buha wrote. “[Luka] Dončić is an offense unto himself, and it takes time to incorporate that type of talent 50-plus games into a season. Once James and Rui Hachimura return, which could be by the end of the week, the Lakers will be well-positioned to finally reach their offensive ceiling.” James has been sidelined by a groin strain he suffered on March 8 versus the Boston Celtics , and Hachimura came down with a case of patellar tendinopathy on Feb. 27. Combined, they're averaging 38.3 points and 13.4 rebounds a game this season, and without them, Los Angeles has had a lack of size, girth and physicality on its frontline. The team will host the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday and the Chicago Bulls on Saturday before starting a four-game road trip on Monday with a contest against the Orlando Magic .
