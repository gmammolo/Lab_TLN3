  "text": "Sports\nLebanese Forward Karim Rtail Commits to Arkansas Razorbacks\nThe Arkansas Razorbacks have secured another key addition to their 2025 recruiting class with the commitment of Lebanese forward Karim Rtail. The 6-foot-9 prospect, who previously played professionally in Lithuania, chose Arkansas over Penn State, Butler, and SMU. His decision further strengthens head coach John Calipari's incoming roster as the program continues to build for the future.\nNEWS: Lebanese forward Karim Rtail has committed to Arkansas, his agents\n— Joe Tipton (@TiptonEdits)[@DanielPoneman]and[@awadallah_weave]tell On3.\nThe 6-9, 20-year-old has been playing professionally in Lithuania.[https://t.co/j28ZojFpBY][pic.twitter.com/M6LGYq8CD4][March 19, 2025]\nA Rising Talent with International Experience\nRtail, 20, brings a wealth of experience to Arkansas, having competed at both the professional and international levels. He most recently played for Neptūnas-Akvaservis in the National Basketball League (NBL) in Lithuania, where he averaged 8.3 points and 4.5 rebounds per game. His best performance of the season came on November 2, when he scored 22 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a decisive 102-79 victory over Delikatesas.\nBeyond his club experience, Rtail has represented Lebanon in the FIBA U19 tournaments in both 2022 and 2023. Over 12 international games, he averaged an impressive 15.7 points and 5.5 rebounds per contest, showcasing his ability to compete at a high level on the global stage.\nArkansas' 2025 Recruiting Class Gains Strength\nRtail's commitment adds to an already strong 2025 class for Arkansas. He joins elite recruits Meleek Thomas, Darius Acuff Jr., and Isaiah Sealy, forming a formidable incoming group. Before his addition, the Razorbacks' class was ranked No. 4 nationally, led by five-star guards Thomas and Acuff.\nUnder John Calipari's leadership, Arkansas continues to be aggressive on the recruiting trail. With Rtail's size, versatility, and international experience, he could be a valuable asset in the Razorbacks' frontcourt when he arrives for the 2025-26 season.\nCopyright 2025 The Arena Group, Inc.
