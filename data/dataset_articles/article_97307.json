  "text": "LSU’s renowned baseball team has won seven National Championships and appeared in 18 College World Series. Most students nowadays probably remember the team that won the 2023 National Championship. It’s important to recognize those who work behind the scenes to make each game successful.\nThe LSU Bat Girls are a prime example of individuals who not only work hard but also represent the Alex Box Stadium. Their job may look easy, but it’s a lot tougher than what meets the eye. Not only does a bat girl have to be in good shape, but they have to have the determination and stamina to run back and forth all game.\nLSU Bat Girls is a voluntary program that one has to be selected for. In total, there were 135 applicants just this season. From there, 88 girls were picked for interviews and only 11 new girls were picked to be Bat Girls.\nThe Bat Girls are responsible for returning bats to players as well as retrieving any foul ball on the field. In addition to those tasks, the girls help take care of the umpires by bringing them water and anything else they might need.\nThe LSU Bat Girls are on the field at every baseball game held at Alex Box Stadium. So, next time you see your favorite player hit a foul ball, pay attention to who goes to get it. To learn more about the Bat Girls, visit their Instagram, @lsubatgirls.",
