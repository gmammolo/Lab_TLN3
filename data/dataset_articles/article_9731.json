  "text": "DENVER ( KDVR ) — A ranger saved a woman “actively drowning” in Horsetooth Reservoir after a gust of wind pushed her paddleboard away from her. On Thursday at 11:16 a.m., Poudre Fire Authority said a caller reported a young woman “going under water” in Horsetooth Reservoir after a strong gust of wind separated her from her paddleboard. The woman was stand-up paddleboarding when the fire authority said she went into the water just before a squall, or wind gust, picked up and pushed the board out of her reach. She wasn’t wearing a life jacket and was at least 100 yards from the shore. She was “actively drowning ,” cold and exhausted, when a Larimer County ranger was able to pull her out of the water. The fire authority said responders put her into a rescue boat and brought her to shore to be assessed by UCHealth first responders. “Storms or simply strong wind can happen in a second in this area in late morning and early afternoon. Please wear a personal flotation device (life vest) even if the weather is beautiful and the water calm because, as we witnessed today, it only takes a moment for that to change,” said the fire authority. This isn’t the first time this week that strong winds have hit the area. On Tuesday afternoon, dry microbursts hit the Denver metro with strong gusts. Trees have been uprooted and homes wrecked. Authorities are warning about water safety, especially after a father died on Monday after wind knocked the paddleboard over at Chatfield State Park. The National Weather Service is telling people to wear a life jacket, watch for building clouds and get off the water before they approach.
