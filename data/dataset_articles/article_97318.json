  "text": "Sydney Thomas, the Alabama student who went viral as a ring girl at the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul fight last year, has shared her March Madness bracket.\nUnsurprisingly, Thomas likes Alabama to win it all. She has No. 2-seed UA defeating 15-seed Robert Morris, 7-seed Saint Mary’s and 11-seed VCU en route to take down 1-seed Duke to win the East Region.\nThomas has the Crimson Tide defeating Midwest No. 1 seed Houston in the Final Four to make the championship game. For the national championship game, Thomas takes Alabama over West 6-seed Missouri .\nIn true IBOB rivalry spirit, Thomas has Auburn getting bounced in the first round, with No. 1 overall seed AU losing to 16-seed Alabama State. She predicts 2-seed Michigan State to win the South Region over 12-seed UC San Diego.\nThe West has Thomas’s boldest predictions. As mentioned before, she has 6-seed Mizzou playing for the national championship. Thomas has the Tigers taking down 11-seed Drake, 3-seed Texas Tech, 2-seed St. John’s, 4-seed Maryland and 2-seed Michigan State. Thomas predicts Florida , the No. 1 seed in the West, will fall in the Sweet 16 to Maryland.\nWe’ll see how Thomas’s bracket fares starting Thursday.\nSydney Thomas' bracket!\nAlabama\nUC San Diego Elite 8\nVCU > Wisconsin #MarchMadness pic.twitter.com/pwLvjOOmMc\n— NCAA March Madness (@MarchMadnessMBB) March 19, 2025",
