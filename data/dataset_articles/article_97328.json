  "text": "The Athletics traveled to Goodyear Ballpark today for the latest tune-up against the Cleveland Guardians. Taking the mound today for the A’s was JP Sears, who is currently 1-1 with a 2.70 ERA in 13.1 innings this spring. He went up against 25-year-old righty Gavin Williams who is 1-0 with a 1.13 ERA in just eight innings going into today’s game.\nWilliams kept the A’s bats quiet until Lawrence Butler ripped a ground-rule double over the centerfield wall for the Athletics first hit of the afternoon. Brent Rooker followed that with his first home run of the spring to give the A’s a 2-0 lead.\nSears cruised along until the bottom of the fourth when things fell apart. Cleveland scored three runs, the final on a pop-up by Juan Brito that was misplayed by Zack Gelof heading toward the foul line. It was scored a hit, but it was a play we’d all expect Gelof to make. That temporarily ended Sears’ day, and he was replaced by Tanner Dodson, who promptly struck out Johnathan Rodriguez swinging to end the inning. Sears line was 3.2 innings, six hits and three earned runs. He stuck out two Guardians.\nWith one out in the top of the fifth, Cleveland starter Gavin Williams walked Max Schuemann up the top of the order. After eighty pitches, his day was done too. Schuemann stole second and Butler singled, moving him to third. Brent Rooker tied the game to 3-3 with a sacrifice fly. Shea Langeliers singled, but Tyler Soderstrom grounded out to the second baseman to end the inning.\nSears re-entered the game in the bottom of the fifth. After striking out steven Kwan and walking José Ramírez, his day was over for good this time. T.J. McFarland replaced Sears this time.\nZack Gelof was hit by a pitch on the hand to lead off the A’s sixth, and was immediately lifted for pinch runner Euribiel Angeles. Angeles was thrown out trying to steal second to end the inning.\nMason Miller came in to finish off the sixth inning. The A’s loaded the bases in the top of the seventh inning. Miles Naylor (one of the three Naylor brothers in MLB camps this spring) singled to drive in CJ Alexander. Jhonny Pereda flied into a sacrifice double play, center fielder Lane Thomas to shortstop Gabriel Rodriguez, but Max Schuemann scored to give the A’s a 5-3 lead. Tyler Soderstrom homered, driving in Drew Avans.\nMiller returned in the bottom of the seventh. He gave up a single to Rodriguez but induced a ground ball double play from the speedy Steven Kwan. Tyler Ferguson replaced Miller with two down in the seventh and got José Ramírez to fly out to end the inning. Noah Murdock tossed a 1-2-3 eighth for the A’s.\nIn the top of the ninth, Drew Avens singled, stole second, and took third on a throwing error. T.J. Schofield-Sam hit a sacrifice fly of Guardians closer Emanuel Clase to bring the score to 8-3. Murdock shut down the Guardians again in the ninth to seal the victory.",
