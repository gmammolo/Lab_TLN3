  "text": "SAVANNAH, Ga. — Two years ago, Tim Jordan stepped down as head basketball coach of Savannah after 37 years. The following fall, George Brown took over and the Blue Jacket program did not skip a beat.\nSHS made the final four in 2024, and won the GHSA Class A Division II title in 2025. The victory marked their first state championship since 1998, under Jordan.\nAdvertisement Coming back to Savannah with a trophy marked the completion of the passing of the torch from a legendary coach, to a new generation of Blue Jacket basketball.\n\"What people don't understand, is Tim Jordan could've easily stayed and coached this team, and probably got another State Championship,\" Brown said. \"It means the world to me that a prominent figure in Georgia basketball history blessed me with the opportunity.\"\nThat opportunity was to lead eleven skilled players, all in the class of 2025, back to the top of Peach State hoops.\n\"We told them if they stayed together, they could do something special,\" Jordan said. \"Winning the State Championship was actually expected.\"\nThe coaches share the same ideology about what basketball can do for the youth in Savannah, as well as some interesting milestones reached in big time moments. Despite graduating almost an entire roster this year, the Blue Jackets are primed for success next season.\nWatch the video to hear from Coach Brown and Jordan on the past, present, and future of Savannah High hoops.",
