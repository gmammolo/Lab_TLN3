  "text": "Sports\nNBA Announces Exciting Cade Cunningham News, Fans React\nThe Detroit Pistons have really turned their franchise around. After finishing at the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings in the past two seasons, they are now in contention for an automatic playoff spot.\nEntering Wednesday's game against the Miami Heat, Detroit boasts a 38-31 record for the sixth seed in the East. They are five games ahead of the seventh-seeded Atlanta Hawks, giving them a pretty good cushion amid their postseason bid.\nSure enough, however, the Pistons wouldn't have had that much success had it not been for their superstar, Cade Cunningham.\nCunningham has been sensational so far this 2024-25 season, even making his first All-Star Game. He has averaged 25.6 points, 6.0 rebounds and 9.3 assists through 64 outings so far this campaign.\nFurthermore, the NBA announced on Wednesday before the Pistons-Heat clash that Cunningham is actually just the third player in league history to have at least 4,300 points, 1,000 rebounds and 1,400 assists in their first 200 games.\nNBA legend Oscar Robertson and now Los Angeles Lakers star Luka Doncic are the other two.\n\"DETROIT'S MOTORCADE,\" the NBA wrote on X. \"Cade Cunningham joined Oscar Robertson (1960-63) & Luka Dončić (2018-21) as the ONLY players to tally at least 4,300 PTS, 1,000 REB, and 1,400 AST through their first 200 games!\"\nDETROIT'S MOTORCADE.\n— NBA (@NBA)\nCade Cunningham joined Oscar Robertson (1960-63) & Luka Dončić (2018-21) as the ONLY players to tally at least 4,300 PTS, 1,000 REB, and 1,400 AST through their first 200 games![pic.twitter.com/lVYjcvMv5K][March 19, 2025]\nNaturally, the news stirred excitement among fans, with many heaping praise on the young guard.\n\"Cade Cunningham is in elite company,\" a commenter wrote. Another one said, \"Cade Cunningham is driving full speed ahead in Detroit!\"\n\"The future is looking bright for Detroit's star,\" a fan added.\n\"This is epic!\" a follower shared, along with a fire emoji.\n\"Cunningham is insane,\" a poster noted. A social media user further stated, \"That's very impressive.\"\n\"This is greatness,\" a seventh supporter said.\nCade Cunningham has certainly proven in this 2024-25 season that he deserves to be in the conversation among the league's best players today. And at 23 years old, he definitely has plenty of room to grow.\nAs fans have said, the future is looking great for Cunningham and the Pistons.\nRelated: Slow-Mo Video of Cole Anthony's Dangerous Collision With Jaden Ivey Emerges\nCopyright 2025 The Arena Group, Inc.
