  "text": "Rangers Bank on Joc Pederson for Offensive Boost in 2025\nThe Texas Rangers are looking to bounce back offensively in 2025, especially at the designated hitter position, which was a significant weakness last season. After leading the American League in runs scored in 2023, the team struggled in 2024 with a poor .205 average at DH, contributing to a fall in overall team performance. Joc Pederson, signed for two years at $37 million, aims to fill this gap after a strong performance with the D-backs, where he achieved career highs in multiple categories. With Pederson's addition, the Rangers believe they can enhance their lineup's potential and improve run production moving forward.\n- Rangers DHs hit .205 in 2024, ranking 28th in the MLB.\n- In 2024, Joc Pederson posted career highs: .275 batting average, .393 OBP, and .908 OPS.\n- The Rangers recorded 33 home runs this spring, ranking fourth in the Cactus League.\n- Rangers lost starting pitchers Jon Gray and Cody Bradford to injuries during Spring Training.\n- The team is currently tied for fifth in MLB with 92 extra-base hits this spring.\n- Management feels optimistic about their offensive versatility and potential for higher run production.\nAs the season approaches, the Rangers will look to refine their lineup combinations, particularly incorporating Pederson effectively at DH. The team's ability to capitalize on their strong offensive spring performances may play a critical role in overcoming injuries to their pitching staff. If the offense can consistently generate runs, it will provide essential support for the rotation.\nBottom LineThe Rangers' investment in Joc Pederson reflects their commitment to enhancing offensive performance, especially in the designated hitter role. A successful transition for Pederson could be pivotal to improving the team's overall productivity and competitiveness in the upcoming season.\nRead more at MLB.com\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
