  "text": "The Washington Commanders are taking care of wide receiver Deebo Samuel less than a month after acquiring him via trade.\nThe Commanders agreed to a reworked contract with Samuel on Wednesday that will give him a bit of a raise, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. As part of the deal, Samuel’s $17 million base salary becomes guaranteed, and he will also be eligible for up to $3 million in additional incentives.\nA reworked deal for Deebo in DC: the Commanders are guaranteeing $17 million of Deebo Samuel’s previously non-guaranteed salary for this season, along with adding another $3 million worth of incentives, per sources. Samuel now will play this season on a one-year deal worth up to…\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter)[pic.twitter.com/H5pfBs5gUf][March 19, 2025]\nPreviously, Samuel’s salary was non-guaranteed for 2025. That would have changed around the start of the season, but the $3 million in bonuses is higher than the wide receiver’s previous number. Notably, the move still ensures that Samuel is in a contract year, and will still be eligible for free agency at the end of the 2025 season.\nAs a result of the deal, Washington will have to absorb all of Samuel’s cap hit in 2025, but they are clearly comfortable with that move.\nIn short, Samuel has the opportunity to earn a bit more money than he would have without a reworked deal, and still gets to test the market at the end of the season. Washington, meanwhile, gets cost certainty, and Samuel will be completely off their books in 2026 if they do not bring him back.\nSamuel appears to be extremely motivated after being traded from San Francisco to Washington. The 29-year-old will be looking for a bounce-back season after catching just 51 passes for 670 yards with three touchdowns in 2024.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
