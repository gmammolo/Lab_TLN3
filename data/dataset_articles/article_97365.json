  "text": "'I'm really happy': Fifteen-year-old Kiwi puts athletics world on notice with mind-blowing running feat\nA prodigious 15-year-old Kiwi became the youngest in the world ever to run a mile in less than four minutes in a mind-bending feat in Auckland on Wednesday night.\nSam Ruthe clocked 3:58.35 at the ACA Mile Night to burst through the iconic barrier 24 days short of his 16th birthday.\nIn a potential indication of the incredible career that may await the New Zealand teenager, the previous youngest sub-four-minute miler was Jakob Ingebrigtsen — the Norwegian superstar who's won Olympic gold medals in the 1500m and 5000m, and currently holds five world records.\nREAD MORE: Phil Gould 'shook hands' with Origin bolter before deal fell apart\nREAD MORE: McGuire reveals rival's $2.5m war chest in hunt for teen star\nREAD MORE: Khawaja's stoush with Queensland cricket revealed\nIngebrigtsen was 16 years and 250 days when he posted 3:58.07 in the US city of Eugene in 2017.\nPrecocious Australian talent Cameron Myers was 16 years and 259 days when he blazed through the John Landy Mile in 3:55.44 in Melbourne in 2023.\nWednesday night's race was won by Kiwi Olympian Sam Tanner in 3:58.29.\nWell aware of the history Ruthe was chasing, Tanner moved into the second lane on the home straight and, repeatedly glancing at the youngster, barked words of encouragement.\nWhen Ruthe crossed the finish line inside four minutes, Tanner thrust his arms in the air, ecstatic for his teammate.\nRuthe was more subdued, but the Tauranga product gestured as if to say \"I've done it\" as he crossed the finish line, and was soon wearing a beaming smile as the gravity of his feat sunk in.\nA modest but spirited trackside crowd watched and applauded the historic run.\n\"This was probably my favourite goal that I've reached. I've definitely enjoyed this one the most, with all the people here supporting me,\" Ruthe said.\n\"This has been the most set up for me, so I'm really happy to have gotten this one.\"\nIn Auckland last month, Ruthe ran a 1500m in 3:41.25 to break Ingebrigtsen's world age-15 best — the 3:42.44 clocked by the Norwegian in Oslo in 2016.",
