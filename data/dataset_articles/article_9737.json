  "text": "WASCO CO. — As residents return to areas impacted by the Rowena Fire, safety remains a top priority. The Oregon Department of Emergency Management (OEM), Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), and Wasco County strongly recommend property owners not perform cleanup themselves, because of the serious toxic hazard threats posed by burned homes and outbuildings.\nDoing your own cleanup without proper protection puts your health at risk. Burned materials are hazardous and require more than gloves and a mask to protect your health. Buildings constructed before 2004 are likely to contain asbestos, which is carcinogenic.",
