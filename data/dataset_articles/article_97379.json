He left university after his junior year to declare for the NFL Draft.\nThe Bombers have two holes to fill in their starting unit in the secondary after Brandon Alexander was not re-signed and Tyrell Ford joined the Edmonton Elks.\nThe CFL Combine is later this week, followed by the draft on April 29.
