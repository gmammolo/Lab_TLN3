  "text": "Women’s Basketball Faces New Mexico State in WNIT Showdown\nThe Pacific women's basketball team is gearing up for its eighth postseason appearance, facing New Mexico State in the opening round of the 2025 Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT). The Tigers, with a record of 15-18, previously competed against the Aggies, holding a strong 7-2 record in Stockton during their shared time in the Big West Conference. To secure victory, Pacific will lean on its defensive strengths, particularly in forcing turnovers and blocking shots, as they aim to capitalize on past successes against NMSU.\n- Pacific's defense has forced 651 turnovers this season, ranking in the top 35 nationally.\n- Graduate Liz Smith has 84 steals, while senior Anaya James has 75 steals this season.\n- The team's defensive strategy relies heavily on the backcourt duo of Smith and James.\n- Junior Sydney Ward and sophomore Marina Radocaj have both achieved 30+ blocks this season.\nThe Tigers aim for a strong opening round against New Mexico State, with a focus on leveraging their defensive advantages.
