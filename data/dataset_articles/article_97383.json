  "text": "SAVANNAH, Ga. — WJCL's partner Tormenta FC proudly supports the United Soccer League's (USL) groundbreaking decision to implement a promotion and relegation system, a move that transforms the landscape of American soccer. With the approval of a supermajority of USL owners, this shift introduces a three-tier system where clubs rise or fall based on seasonal performance, aligning U.S. soccer with top global leagues.\n“We’re thrilled to be at the forefront of this transformative moment,” said Darin Van Tassell, Owner and President of Tormenta FC. “The USL’s decision opens new horizons for clubs like ours, showing that with dedication, teams from smaller markets can reach the pinnacle of the sport.”\nAdvertisement Founded in 2015, Tormenta FC has already made a name for itself with championships in the USL W League and USL League One in 2022.\nThe decision aligns the USL with top international leagues like the English Premier League, La Liga, and the Bundesliga, where promotion and relegation add stakes to every match and fuel fan engagement. The shift is part of a broader vision to enhance competition and foster long-term growth for soccer in the U.S.\n\"A new chapter in American soccer begins,\" said Alec Papadakis, CEO of the USL. \"This bold direction highlights our commitment to not only providing top-tier competition but also strengthening community engagement. Now, more communities across America can aspire to compete at the highest level.\"\nAs part of this transformation, the USL announced plans to launch a new Division One league in 2027-28, which will sit atop the newly restructured system. Currently, the USL Championship (Division Two) and USL League One (Division Three) lay the foundation for this new framework. With all three leagues interconnected through promotion and relegation, the USL aims to create a more dynamic and competitive environment for clubs, players, and fans.\n\"This is a transformative moment for American soccer,\" said Paul McDonough, USL President and Chief Soccer Officer. \"With international events like the 2026 World Cup on the horizon, the time is right to create a sustainable future for the sport. Fans want high-stakes competition, where every match matters, and this system delivers that excitement.\"",
