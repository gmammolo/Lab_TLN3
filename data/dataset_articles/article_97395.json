  "text": "EAGAN, Minn. — The Vikings on Wednesday announced they've agreed to terms with receiver Rondale Moore.\nThe 24-year-old is joining Minnesota after missing all of 2024 — his lone season with Atlanta — because of a knee injury suffered during a joint practice with Miami last August.\nThe Falcons acquired Moore by trading QB Desmond Ridder to the Arizona Cardinals in March 2024.\nMoore joined Arizona in 2021 as a second-round pick (49th overall) out of Purdue and quickly made an impact. He recorded four catches for 68 yards on five targets at Tennessee in Week 1 then exploded with seven catches for 114 yards, including a 77-yard touchdown from Kyler Murray in Week 2, when the Cardinals topped the Vikings 34-33.\nHe has totaled 135 receptions for 1,201 yards and three touchdowns on 182 targets. Fifty-one of Moore's receptions have resulted in first downs/touchdowns.\nListed at 5-foot-7, Moore's speed also has been implemented in the run game. He has rushed 52 times for 249 yards and one score.\nView photos of WR Rondale Moore who joined the Vikings during free agency.\nMoore was utilized as a rookie on special teams, as well. He returned 21 punts for 171 yards (8.1 avg.) and 13 kickoffs for 291 yards (22.4 avg.).\nA native of New Albany, Indiana, Moore finished his high school football career across the Ohio River at Trinity in Louisville, Kentucky. He earned 2017 Kentucky Gatorade Player of the Year honors and helped Trinity win a state title before attending Purdue.\nMoore won the Paul Hornung Award, which is presented to the nation's most versatile player, as a true freshman, when he racked up an FBS-best 114 receptions and led the Big Ten with 1,258 receiving yards and 12 receiving touchdowns in 2018. Moore added 213 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 21 rushes and returned 33 kickoffs and 12 punts that season on the way to consensus All-America, Big Ten Receiver of the Year and Freshman of the Year honors.\nA hamstring injury sidelined him for all but four games in 2019, and he only played three games in 2020.",
