  "title": "FSU's message to 4-star Michigan DB commit Brody Jennings: 'I belong at Florida State'",
  "text": "Michigan four-star defensive back commit Brody Jennings has a special connection to Florida State.\nJennings' father, Bradley Jennings, played linebacker at FSU. For that reason, Brody has been around Tallahassee plenty throughout his life. Now as a blue-chip recruit, FSU is working hard to make him a 'Nole, something they weren't able to accomplish with his two older brothers: Bradley Jennings Jr. and Branden Jennings.\n\"I belong at Florida State. My brothers didn't come here but they're going to get one Jennings. That's what they said,\" Jennings said of FSU's message to him on today's visit.\nJennings got to take in FSU's first spring football practice. He shadowed cornerbacks coach Patrick Surtain Sr. throughout and kept a close eye on the defensive back group during the practice.\n\"Definitely how the DBs was making plays and how the DBs took the coaching from coach Norvell,\" Jennings said on what stood out at today's practice. \"He coaches really hard. They took the coaching and they let it motivate them. He yelled at one DB and the next play he caught an interception. They're just taking to coaching very well.\"\nFSU is looking at Jennings as a boundary cornerback.\nThe 6-foot-1, 175-pounder has been committed to the Wolverines since last July but is still very much open to other schools. He has six official visits set with the following schools: Auburn, Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Michigan.\nIs an official visit to Tallahasee on the table?\n\"Most likely, yessir. I haven't set one up yet,\" Jennings said of a possible OV to FSU.\nIt sounded like Jennings was going to talk with FSU's coaching staff further on the visit about setting up an official visit.\nWhen asked whether the 'Noles were in the main group of programs working to flip him or in a tier below, he was quick to call the Seminoles a contender.\n\"No, they're in the main group. Definitely, they're DBU,\" Jennings said of FSU's placement in his recruitment. \"Other schools are DBU too but Florida State, I could say the DBs off the top of my head with them. Other schools, I've probably got to think about it. Florida State is definitely DBU and people know, coach Norvell, I've had a relationship him as I've been coming to Florida State since middle school.\"\nJennings is a four-star prospect in the 247Sports Composite Rankings, slotted as the nation's No. 256 overall player and No. 22 ranked cornerback in the 2026 class.\nClick below to see ZB's Take on Jennings' recruitment",
