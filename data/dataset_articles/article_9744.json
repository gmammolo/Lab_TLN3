  "text": "Over 24,000 Jamaicans received Hurricane Beryl assistance from Food For The Poor\nMore than 24,000 Jamaicans who were impacted by Hurricane Beryl last year have benefited from recovery initiatives by charity organisation Food For The Poor Jamaica.\nThe recovery efforts include repairing 409 roofs, which assisted more than 1,600 individuals; the construction of over 20 new homes in Clarendon and St. Elizabeth for families affected by the hurricane; and the distribution of nearly 5,000 care packages across six parishes.\nFood For The Poor, which is the largest charity organisation in Jamaica, also assisted the agricultural sector through recovery projects that benefited more than 100 farmers and indirectly supported 300 more.\nIt also provided more than 600 farmers and fisherfolk with tools, training, and relief packages.\n“Food For The Poor Jamaica remains committed not just to responding in times of crisis, but to walking alongside communities until they are fully restored,” said William Massias, acting executive director of Food For The Poor Jamaica.\n“As we mark one year since Hurricane Beryl, we honour the resilience of those affected and reaffirm our mission to rebuild lives with dignity and compassion.”\nThe non-governmental organisation said it also partnered with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to provide hurricane shelters with food, bedding, and hygiene supplies.\nAdditional initiatives included greenhouse repairs, back-to-school grants, mental health support, and the restoration of a health centre in Rocky Point, Clarendon.\nNoting that the southern parishes of St. Elizabeth, Clarendon, and Manchester experienced the most severe structural damage from the Category Four storm, Food For The Poor said it was particularly active in those areas.\nIn the communities of Portland Cottage, Rocky Point, and Lionel Town in Clarendon, it repaired more than 300 roofs, constructed over 10 new homes for displaced and vulnerable families, and installed four community water access points to ensure safe drinking water.\nIt also conducted public health and hygiene awareness sessions—covering sanitation, handwashing, menstrual hygiene, and water safety in the communities—provided livelihood support and training for fisherfolk, and distributed essential food, toiletries, and hygiene supplies during critical recovery phases.\nAs it prepares for this hurricane season, Food For The Poor said it is pre-positioning emergency relief supplies at distribution centres across vulnerable parishes, collaborating with national disaster agencies, and participating in the National Disaster Response Committee.\nIt also hosts regular internal preparedness meetings to monitor weather patterns, update contingency plans, and confirm readiness across all departments.\n- Sashana Small\nFollow The Gleaner on X, formerly Twitter, and Instagram @JamaicaGleaner and on Facebook @GleanerJamaica.
