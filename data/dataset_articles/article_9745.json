  "text": "DURHAM, N.C. — Disaster response volunteers with N.C. Baptists on Mission have joined the cleanup efforts in central North Carolina after the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal brought heavy rain and flooding to the region over the weekend.\nAfter making preliminary assessments earlier in the week, officials with N.C. Baptists on Mission set up a recovery site in Durham on Thursday, and volunteers were out early in the morning assisting area residents whose homes experienced flood damage during the storm.\nVolunteers spent the day removing mud and debris from flooded homes along the Eno River, which runs through Durham and Orange counties. Sunday’s storm caused the Eno River to crest at a record 25.63 feet, eclipsing the previous high of 23.58 feet set during Hurricane Fran in 1996.\nRainfall totals from Chantal surpassed 10 inches in some places, and the subsequent flooding damaged roads, houses and businesses across central North Carolina. More than 100 water rescues took place in Durham and Orange counties, many of which were along the Eno River.\nThe storm is being blamed for six deaths, and local states of emergency remain in place for Alamance, Moore, Orange and Person counties. According to the N.C. Department of Transportation, approximately 50 roads remain impacted by Chantal statewide.\nThe storm also spawned five confirmed tornadoes that touched down in Alamance, Chatham, Lee, New Hanover and Orange counties.\nTom Beam, disaster response coordinator with N.C. Baptists on Mission, said he anticipates volunteers to be serving in the area for about two weeks, adding that teams will continue to assess and monitor needs in the region.\n“Our prayers are with everyone who has been impacted by Tropical Storm Chantal,” Beam said. “This storm brought flooding that the central part of North Carolina hasn’t seen in a number of years. We’re incredibly grateful for our many disaster response volunteers who are willing and able to serve at a moment’s notice by providing help and hope in Jesus’ name to those affected by this storm.”",
