  "text": "Cardinals Defensive Line Emerges as Most Improved After Free Agency\nThe Arizona Cardinals have significantly improved their defensive line through NFL free agency, as highlighted by PFF's Max Chadwick. The unit, previously ranked 28th in the league, added key players including edge rusher Josh Sweat and defensive tackle Dalvin Tomlinson. With an investment of nearly $125 million, the Cardinals aim to enhance their pass-rush capability and overall defensive performance, moving past last year's struggles that saw them with the fifth-lowest-graded defensive line.\n- Cardinals' defensive line ranked 28th in the NFL last season.\n- Josh Sweat registered 10.5 sacks in the regular season and playoffs combined last year.\n- Dalvin Tomlinson logged 16 tackles and four sacks with the Cleveland Browns in 2024.\n- Arizona invested nearly $125 million in its defensive front.\n- Cardinals had 41 total sacks last season, ranking 13th in the NFL.\n- Key free-agent additions have been made to bolster both edge and interior defensive positions.\n- Injuries affected performance last season, with a focus on improving health for key players in 2025.\n- Re-signing of outside linebacker Baron Browning aims to stabilize the edge rusher situation.\nThe Cardinals will be looking to integrate their new signings into the defense, aiming for greater consistency and performance in the upcoming season. They'll monitor the development of Darius Robinson, hoping for a strong sophomore season to further solidify the defensive line. Enhanced health and reduced injuries will be vital contributors to the team's success.\nBottom LineThe Cardinals are poised for a defensive resurgence after substantial investments in their line, with hopes that new player additions and improved health can lead to a much stronger performance in 2025. The blend of experience and youth could be the key to turning around the team's defensive fortunes.\nRead more at Arizona Sports\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
