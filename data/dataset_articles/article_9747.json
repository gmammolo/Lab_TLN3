  "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. — The city of Orlando's Streets and Stormwater Division is holding a free sandbag distribution event Thursday through Saturday to help residents prepare for potential flooding and protect their homes and property in the event of a hurricane this year.\nWhat You Need To Know Orlando is offering free sandbags to residents from Thursday to Saturday\nThe sandbags are available at 1010 Woods Avenue from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. Thursday and Friday from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday\nStreets and Stormwater Division crews will load up to 10 free, pre-made sandbags into residents' cars\nThe goal is to help residents avoid the rush and long lines if a hurricane heads toward Orlando The division will provide residents with free, pre-made sandbags from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. Thursday and Friday and from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday. City crews will be on site at the division's facilities at 1010 Woods Avenue in Orlando to help load sandbags directly into vehicles.\nThe city wants to ensure residents are prepared early and don't have to rush around for supplies when a storm is headed toward Orlando, according to Hannah Yucht, public outreach coordinator for Orlando's Streets and Stormwater Division.\n\"You don't have to wait in a long line. You're coming, you're getting your sandbags and you're leaving all within 2 minutes,\" Yucht said. \"Today, you can come and our team will put them in your trunk for you.\"\nEach vehicle is limited to 10 sandbags. A self-serve option also is available at the site while supplies last, if residents prefer to bag their own sand.\nThis event is just part of what the Streets and Stormwater Division does to be ready for hurricane season.\n\"Our job here with Streets and Stormwater is to make sure that our residents are prepared and our lakes are prepared,\" Yucht said. \"So, we're out every day cleaning out storm drains, monitoring lake levels, and (during this event), we're making sure our residents are prepared with their sandbags as well.\"\nShe said crews are cleaning out storm drains on a more frequent basis this time of year, especially in areas that are more prone to flooding.",
