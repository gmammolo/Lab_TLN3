  "text": "Risacher, who doesn’t turn 20 until April 8, tied Rockets guard Jalen Green (4) for third in NBA history among teenagers with the most games with 20 or more points scored and five-plus 3-pointers made, according to Stat Mamba. Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards (8) and Grizzlies forward GG Jackson (5) are the others.\n“I feel like every game I feel more comfortable. I’m able to learn like every possession,” Risacher said.\n“Honestly, it’s a new environment. I got great teammates, too. They helped me a lot on the court and off the court, and I’m just in great condition to learn, with, like, the coaches, my teammates, the organization.We’re playing a lot of games, so it’s like it’s great for young player like me to be able to compete every night with those guys.”Mike Curtis: Asked Jason Kidd about possible benchmarks that Anthony Davis needs to clear before he’s able to play: “He’s trending in the right place. He had a positive experience in the practice. He’ll continue to do things this week.\nHopefully the outcome continues to be positive. A lot of good things, but he’s still some time away for him being in a game.”Keith Pompey:\n#Sixers guard/forward Kelly Oubre Jr. (right knee sprain) will miss tonight’s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.Guerschon Yabusele (right knee soreness) is still questionable and his status will be determined after his pregame workout.James L Edwards III:\nThibs said Mitchell Robinson will play.Danny Cunningham: The\nKings have ruled out Zach LaVine tonight against the #Cavs.He will miss the game due to personal reasons.\nWlahmir Marques (1937-2025)\nInternational basketball has lost one of its great legends with FIBA Hall of Fame forward Wlamir Marques having passed away. Nicknamed the Flying Saucer and also the Blond Devil, Marques died in a Sao Paulo hospital. He was 87.\nMarch 19, 2025 | 5:58 pm EDT Update\nBeau Estes on being calling the GOATmentator: 'I've had a dream come true, and I'm very luck for that'\nLastly, what are your thoughts on the NBA internet community calling you the GOATmentator? Beau Estes: I don’t walk into negotiations with Turner Sports and say look right here, I’m the GOATmentator, pay me $10 million. I know it’s not bad right? Like it’s just not but it is something very nice and I know when I die, the one thing I’ll be known for is these Top 10, and that GOATmentator thing, and I’m OK with that. That’s very much what a young Beau Estes would have dreamed about.\nBeing known to be an announcer with the NBA would have been a dream come true. I’ve lived it. I’ve had a dream come true and I’m very lucky for that.Beau Estes: We’re in competition with everyone who’s putting out creative and great content on the internet and on social right away. We’re not gonna win every eye, so it’s a challenge to do something great, unique, and again this is where I think if we do something unique – like I try to do with the Top 10 – we’re in an advantage because you can only find that where only we do that. But it certainly makes our challenge greater, right? You look out there and look at the amount of incredibly talented people who are doing content with the NBA, not just fun stuff like I do, but in great analysis, fantasy breakdowns of games and stuff like that. It’s just a real challenge, and to take that a step further, what makes it really interesting is if you’re a television programmer – like ours or ESPN – what do you put out there because you need to get as many eyes as possible on it.",
