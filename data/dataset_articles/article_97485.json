  "text": "Perhaps the biggest story of the 2024-25 NCAA Div. I wrestling season came when 2000 Olympic champion Gable Steveson decided to use his last year of eligibility and return for one final season, once again being the superstar heavyweight for the University of Minnesota.\nSteveson, with same the style and flash that he has brought to everything in his life, was spectacular this year for the Gophers, and enters his final NCAA Championships at the top of his game. After pursuing other things in his life, like the WWE and trying out for professional football with the Buffalo Bills, Steveson returned to the stage where he has made his biggest impact – on the wrestling mat.\nSteveson brought his A game to the NCAA Championships press conference on Wednesday, where he promised the wrestling community something even bigger and better.\n“I want to finish off the tournament in dominating fashion. I did it for a long time. I can do it again. And I think this year I'm going to do it in such a way that people aren't even going to fathom what I'm about to do. But I let the wrestling speak for itself,” he said.\nWhen asked for an opening statement, Steveson felt compelled to introduce himself, not that he would ever need an introduction within the wrestling community.\n“My name is Gable Steveson, Olympic champion, 2-time NCAA champion, 4-time Big Ten champion, the first and only heavyweight, 2-time Dan Hodge Trophy winner, the first heavyweight to do that also. I am looking for a great time. I am looking to make history once again this weekend,” he said.\nGable has gone 14-0 on the season, and has been dominant in each of his victories, with nine technical falls, two pins and two major decisions. In his mind, he has had his best college season ever.\n“I feel great. I think this has been the best season I have had overall, in my mind and my body,” he said. “I feel like I am better in a lot of things. I am better as a person, better as an athlete, better as everything in between. I am real happy I decided to come back and take this opportunity. I am ready to lay it out on the mat for five great matches and show the world who I am, once again. Everything has been really fun.”\nGable spoke often about helping the Minnesota program and its young athletes as a motivation for making his comeback to college.\n“My focus has been coming back and being with the guys after leaving in 2022. Taking two years off, it was a hard thing. I am getting older and guys on the team are getting younger. Coming back, showing them the leeway about what it takes to be something great at this sport was definitely a big thing. I am happy I did it. I feel really good and I think this is a blessing for me and for the team, leading on into the future too,” he said.\nCertainly, Steveson had financial incentives to return this year as well, and has been able to benefit from the new college athletics climate with NIL deals and athlete payments. He is not shy to talk about that at all.\n“This is a great time for all collegiate sports. Guys that are going out and getting paid after big NIL deals and buying fancy cars, like Shaddeur Sanders and all those guys living luxurious lives. I think it's cool for athletes to go out and get what they deserve and get their checks in and go out and cash them too.”\n“It's the same thing with us. We're going to go out there and handle business and take care of everything that needs to be taken care of. The end goal for us is to go out there and live a better life instead of living day-to-day. It's a big step for all of us, and I think it's a great thing. And I'm happy that we're accumulating what we're accumulating, and hopefully it keeps going for everybody else,” said Steveson.\nThe media asked the three seniors in the press conference, Steveson, Carter Starocci of Penn State and Keegan O’Toole of Missouri, about competing in his last tournament, none of them indicated that this would be their last competition. World and Olympic achievements are certainly in the goals for Starocci and O’Toole, but does this mean that Steveson is looking to come back for more international freestyle wrestling?\n“I don't think this is all of our last time, but this is the biggest one of year for all of us. If you all see me competing until I die, take me off the mat before that. That's too long for me. I'm happy to be here. I'm going to compete, have a great time and put a smile on my face and let the crowd see that we're happy to be here too,” he said.\nSteveson has always been a master of suspense about what he is doing, using social media and other tools to create some mystery about his intentions. When asked about what is next, Steveson would not be specific.\n“I will let people know what’s going on. I just want to get through this tournament, focus on the next three days and score points. I am going for all bonus points right now, just blow guys out of the water. Be dominant as I have all year and be me, too. On Sunday, I will wake up and everything is all good, and I will figure it out from there. Right now, these next three days are important, and I will give my all,” he said.\nSteveson admitted that football was fun, and said he would consider trying out for football again, if given more time in the off-season to develop in a sport he never played. But…\n“But right now, I don’t even know either. If the call comes, we may figure it out, but right now, just show this NCAA Tournament, show the crowd who I am, let them know what’s up again, and win that title,” he said.\nBut what about that big thing he has planned for this weekend in Philadelphia, that “people aren't even going to fathom?”\n“I’ve got some things planned. I will take it one day at a time, and make sure everyone sees it,” said Steveson.",
