  "text": "Manchester City striker Vivianne Miedema stunned Chelsea as Sonia Bompastor’s 28-game unbeaten run came to an end in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie at Joie Stadium.\nIn a fairly drab replay of Sunday’s League Cup final – which Chelsea won 2-1 – City made a breakthrough after Miedema came on at half-time and broke the deadlock after 60 minutes.\nFollowing the goal, Chelsea looked to have shifted their mentality and managed to gain some momentum in the final third with Mayra Ramirez scoring a goal which would instantly be ruled out for offside.\nAnd, with 80 minutes gone, Johanna Rytting Kaneryd smashed the frame of the goal with a powerful, close-ranged effort.\nFortunately for City, the visitors couldn’t force an equaliser as Miedema doubled her scoring to put her side two goals up with mere minutes left to play as the pressure now stands with the visitors when the second leg is played at Stamford Bridge next week.\nStory of the Match\nNick Cushing was perhaps the best replacement for Gareth Taylor given the silverware he won with the club during his first spell in charge – including their only Women’s Super League title triumph in 2016.\nBut he will need to prove to the board that he is worthy of the permanent role through a test of several tough fixtures ahead.\nBefore the knockout rounds began, City had won five of their six group stage games and boasted a 100% record at the Joie Stadium in the Women’s Champions League.\nAnd after an hour of football here, with a lot of aimless attempts on goal, substitute Miedema opened the scoring with an emphatic strike towards goal.\nInitially, Mary Fowler had collected the ball on the edge of the area after it was cleared from a corner before cutting across Sjoeke Nusken and sending a perfectly weighted cross towards Laia Aleixandri who was waiting in the box.\nThe City captain managed to get a good connection on the ball with a header and Hampton, using her incredible reflexes, managed to push the ball onto the crossbar before Miedema, standing on the left side of the box, finished the rebound off to give City a well-deserved advantage.\nThe 28-year-old then doubled her side’s lead when she met Kerolin’s short pass before firing a left-footed strike into the bottom left corner of Hampton’s net.\nAnd to make matters worse for Chelsea, Ramirez managed to finish off a slick run of play when Aggie Beaver-Jones sent the forward through on goal, but it was ruled out for offside shortly after as Bompastor’s 28-game unbeaten run looked to be in jeopardy.\nJust four minutes after her goal, Miedema found herself on the counter again, but struggled in getting past Millie Bright – and instead shooting from the edge of the area, which was saved rather easily by Hannah Hampton.\nThe hosts were much more creative than their counterpart in the opening half but couldn’t seem to pair that with the clinicalness needed to make a difference in front of goal.\nThe most promising chance was the first of the game when Kerolin – who joined City from North Carolina Courage in January – took aim from the edge of the area before her effort floated narrowly over the bar.\nTwenty-six minutes later there was another chance for City as 18-year-old Lily Murphy found space down the left before cutting the ball onto her right foot.\nFrom there, the midfielder fired towards the bottom left corner but Hampton made a strong, low stop to prevent an early opener.\nChelsea’s start to the second period was much better than that of the first as Lauren James managed to dispatch a left-footed strike towards the bottom right corner and, if it wasn’t for Ayaka Yamashita’s intuition, the visitors could have taken the lead.",
