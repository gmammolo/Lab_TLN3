  "text": "Colorado’s Alpine Rescue Team sent on three rescue missions over the weekend\nCLEAR CREEK COUNTY, Colo. (KKTV) - Colorado’s Alpine Rescue Team responded to three separate, simultaneous missions on Sunday.\nCrews said the day began with a call of a hiker suffering from altitude sickness on Kelso Ridge in Dillon. They said a Flight for Life was called in to help find the hiker, as well as help crew members into the field.\nBecause of the weather, rescue members said they could not shuttle down from the helicopter to help. Instead, they said teams on the ground were able to go up the mountain and help the hiker back down.\nDuring the first call, rescue members said they were alerted to two more missions at Saint Mary’s Glacier in Clear Creek County.\nCrews said both people had fallen and were injured. They said one person was evacuated from the slabs west of the lake, and the other was evacuated from Fox Mountain Road.\nRescue teams were able to find both of those hikers as well.\n\"As we head into the summer months it’s important to remember that a helicopter is never plan A, not even for rescuers. There are many factors outside our control that can limit aerial support,“ the Alpine Rescue Team said. ”Regardless of how we get to you, we’re always happy to assist those having a bad day in the mountains.\"\nCopyright 2025 KKTV.
