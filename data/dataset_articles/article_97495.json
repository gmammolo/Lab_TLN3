  "text": "On Wednesday, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) announced that South Carolina basketball star sophomore forward Collin Murray-Boyles earned inclusion on their All-South Atlantic District as a first-team selection. Instead of choosing postseason award teams by conference, the NABC now organizes them geographically. There are ten geographic regions represented by NABC all-district teams. Murray-Boyles earned the honor after averaging 16.8 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.5 steals, and 1.3 blocks per game for the Gamecocks. He also shot better than 58% from the field, leading the SEC in the category among qualified players. No other player in college basketball averaged at least 16 points, eight rebounds, two assists, one steal, one block, and 55% field goal efficiency. CMB also was one of the top (and most versatile) defenders in the sport. Murray-Boyles also earned several All-SEC honors this March. Stay on top of all things Gamecocks for just $1 for 7 days—lock in this special offer today! The Columbia, South Carolina native has NBA decision-makers salivating. Because of that, most NBA Draft mocks have him within their first-round projections. Some even predict a spot for Murray-Boyles in the NBA Draft lottery (first 14 picks) . If Murray-Boyles hears his name called in the first round this summer, he’ll be the first Gamecock star to earn a top-30 spot since the New York Knicks took Renaldo Balkman at pick No. 20 in 2006. GG Jackson (No. 45 to the Memphis Grizzlies in 2023) was the last USC player to earn NBA Draft selection. This year’s NBA Draft will take place on Friday, June 25th and Saturday, June 26th. Murray-Boyles’ final deadline to decide if he will return to school or enter the draft will be mid-June. ABC, ESPN, and the ESPN app will broadcast and stream coverage of the festivities.
