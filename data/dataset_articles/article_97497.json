  "text": "MADISON, Wis. -- Attention middle and high school student athletes: Football University (FBU) will kick back to Edgewood High School on April 12, FBU said Wednesday. The nationally re-owned football camp series invites all student athletes regardless of skill level to join in on the fun. “This is an exciting time for Football University as we take our enhanced Camp Model across the country in 2025,” said Football University Sales & Marketing Director Matt Lauer. “Madison has been a market we’ve had the pleasure of visiting for many years. When you consider the historical, and passionate, football tradition, along with the number of talented student-athletes in the area, it was a no-brainer to bring our camp back to Madison, specifically Edgewood High School, in 2025.” Those who attend will receive technique training from coaches with NCAA and NFL experience, and will receive player ratings, star rankings and post-camp leaderboards and evaluations. Representatives from the following companies will be on-site to evaluate participants to possibly invite student athletes in the future: “We’re excited to partner with FBU for their upcoming event season. FBU has long been known as the premier destination for middle school & high school student-athletes to get better and get noticed. We’re excited for the opportunities that this camp will provide for the student-athletes in our school, our city, and our state\" stated Edgewood High Schools Head Coach Jesse Norris.
