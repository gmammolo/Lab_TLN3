  "text": "The NFL draft is here – April 25-26 – and the Oregon Ducks Pro Day held on Tuesday, March 18, at the Moshofsky Center was a golden stage for Oregon stars to showcase their skills. For prospects like wide receiver Tez Johnson and quarterback Dillon Gabriel, it was one of the last chances to boost their draft stock, and they certainly made the most of it.\nSan Francisco 49ers general manager John Lynch, Justin Herbert of the Los Angeles Chargers, and Bo Nix of the Denver Broncos were in attendance to show support.\nWith College Sports Network’s NFL Mock Draft Simulator, you call the shots. Draft your favorite college stars and shape the destiny of one or all 32 teams. Tez Johnson and Dillon Gabriel Shine at Ducks’ Pro Day You had better be fast to break into the NFL as a wide receiver at 5’10” and 154 pounds. In the NFL Combine, all eyes were on Johnson to deliver a blazing 40-yard dash time and silence critics questioning whether his smaller frame could thrive at the next level. However, his 4.51-second sprint was far below expectations, ranking him 27th among wide receivers.\nMany expected Johnson to use Oregon’s Pro Day to improve his 40-yard dash time. Instead, the WR focused on passing drills . Teaming up with Gabriel, the 2025 NFL Draft top 100 prospects gave a show. Gabriel delivered a series of pinpoint throws, and Johnson matched his energy with impressive catches.\nGabriel, the most experienced collegiate quarterback in history, is also preparing for his next step: the NFL. The 5’11”, 205-pound quarterback threw for 3,857 yards and 30 touchdowns in the 2024 season. He led the Ducks to a 13-1 record that saw them win the Big Ten Championship and earn the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff.\nThe sixth-year hopes his experience and performance at the Senior Bowl , NFL Combine, and Oregon’s Pro Day will be enough to solidify his place in the upcoming draft.\nKEEP READING: Oregon Legends Justin Herbert and Bo Nix Show up for Dillon Gabriel’s Big Moment\nIn this year’s NFL draft, Oregon has its sights on another record for the number of players drafted into the pros. In 2024, they had eight players drafted – a program best. Building on that, 12 Ducks received coveted invitations to last month’s NFL Combine.\nCollege Sports Network has you covered with the latest news, analysis, insights, and trending stories in football , basketball , and more!",
