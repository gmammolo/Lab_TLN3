  "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – Placed in almost any other time in baseball history, Ezequiel Tovar would be a unicorn. Existing right now, in an unprecedented wave of young shortstops, the Rockies’ 23-year-old standout is simply part of a herd of mythical creatures. Last year saw seven shortstops, age 24 or younger on Opening Day, accrue 3.5 or more Wins Above Replacement (as measured by Baseball-Reference). No year in the game’s history can match that number. “The position’s very deep,” Tovar told The Gazette through interpreter Edwin Perez. “It’s a beautiful position to play. “There’s a lot of good shortstops out there. It’s like every position, we all have a good, healthy competition with the whole league. We just want to help our team, make an effort and contribute to success.” Tovar won a Gold Glove last year, led the National League with 45 doubles and hit 26 home runs. He also became the first Rockies hitter to strike out 200 times in a season, but that came in a league-high 655 at-bats. With 2.7 offensive WAR and 2.0 defensive WAR, Tovar became the eighth shortstop 22 or younger to have 2.0 WAR or higher on both sides of the ball in the past 50 years. The others were longtime stars like Cal Ripken Jr., Troy Tulowitzki, Elvis Andrus and Francisco Lindor, or talents who saw off-the-field scandals take them out of the game (Addison Russell, Wander Franco). Looking even further back, the full list includes just 18 players dating back to 1890 and is highlighted by Hall of Famers Rogers Hornsby, Travis Jackson, Rabbit Maranville and Lou Boudreau and Black Sox scandal participant Buck Weaver. Simply put, it’s rare for shortstops that young to be so skilled. But it’s common for those who immediately show those abilities to stick around for the long term. But even within this hyper-specific group, Tovar was joined by St. Louis shortstop Masyn Winn, who bested him on both sides with 3.5 oWAR and 2.4 dWAR. It’s just not a good time to try to gain separation at the position. “There’s a lot of guys out there that are really great players,’ said Kansas City’s Bobby Witt Jr., perhaps the best of the group. “So it’s really great.” Witt offered a glowing assessment of Tovar. “All-around great player,” he said. “Plays great defense but also can hit. That’s what you want to be able to do on both sides and just use all the tools.” Observe the talent distribution at any Little League or high school game, and it becomes apparent how important it is to have a standout at shortstop. So while Tovar may not be standing out within this wave that includes players like Baltimore’s Gunnar Henderson and Cincinnati’s Elly De La Cruz, at least the Rockies aren’t falling behind at the spot. “I played with Tovar when he was 17 in Short-A (in Boise, Idaho),” Rockies first baseman Michael Toglia said. “I remember our farming director saying, ‘Take a look at this guy, he’s only 17 and with the actions of a big-league shortstop.’ I remember being impressed with him, and what was that, six, seven years ago? And to see him grow into the player he’s been the last couple of years is really awesome.” YOUNG WAVE Seven shortstops 24 or younger on Opening Day accrued 3.5 or more Wins Above Replacement (as measured by Baseball-Reference) in 2024, the most of any year in baseball history.

Here were the best from 2024. (Note: Atlanta shortstop Ronald Acuna Jr. posted an 8.4 WAR in 2023 and won NL MVP but saw his 2024 season cut short after 49 games by an injury).
