  "text": "Performance Breakout\nTanner Houck delivered an impressive season in 2024, recording a 3.12 ERA and a 1.142 WHIP over 30 starts. He achieved personal bests in various categories, with his overall win‐above‐replacement value nearly doubling that of his closest teammate on the mound. At 28, his emergence as a key figure in the rotation has positioned him as a standout pitcher within the team’s staff.\nContract Talks\nDespite his exceptional performance, formal discussions regarding a long-term contract extension have not progressed. Houck has indicated a clear willingness to secure his future in Boston, affirming his desire to remain with the team. His remarks underline his commitment and appreciation for the environment in which he competes, although a contract extension has yet to materialize.\nSalary and Future Plans\nThis season marked his first arbitration eligibility, culminating in a salary of $3.95 million. With free agency on the horizon after the 2027 campaign, Houck’s performance and future prospects continue to be closely watched. His forward-looking perspective, coupled with a strong track record, underscores his determination to contribute at a high level for years to come.",
