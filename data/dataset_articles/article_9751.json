  "text": "by WAKA Action 8 News FILE – Gov. Kay Ivey – Photo from Office of Gov. Kay Ivey\nGov. Kay Ivey announced today that the state will help Texas in search and rescue missions following the devastating flooding.\nThe 40-person team she is deploying includes Alabama Task Force 1 of Mobile, Tuscaloosa Fire and Saraland Fire.\n“Search and rescue remains the goal, and Alabama is going to do all we can to lend a helping hand to Texas,” Gov. Ivey said in a statement.\n“We are heartbroken in Alabama to have lost two of our own. I pray for Sarah Marsh’s family as they navigate the unimaginable loss of their precious daughter. My prayers are also with the Santanas as they grieve the loss of Camille and are still searching for three members of their family. Truly, we are all grieving alongside these Alabamians, as well as those in Texas and across our country.”\nThis team is capable of conducting search and rescue response efforts for all hazards, including locating, accessing, medically stabilizing and extricating survivors from impacted structures and areas. Specialized operational personnel include rescue, canine search, medical, hazmat, technical search and communications.\n“I am grateful to all those who are part of the search and rescue mission, and I pray for their safety and for the success of their mission. Y’all, pray for Texas!” Gov. Ivey said.\nThe team is deploying today. This task force operates in 12-hour periods for up to 14 days.\n— Information from Office of Governor Kay Ivey",
