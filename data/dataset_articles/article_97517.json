  "text": "Home-based midfielder Papa Daniel Mustapha has promised to make the most of his Super Eagles opportunity, expressing determination to prove his worth if given a chance in the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Rwanda and Zimbabwe.\nThe 23-year-old Niger Tornadoes star, one of two NPFL players in Coach Eric Chelle’s debut Super Eagles squad, opened up about his unexpected call-up and experience training alongside Nigeria’s established internationals.\n“I never expected it. I was just doing my thing,” Mustapha told the team’s media from their Radisson Blu camp in Kigali.\n“When I saw the provisional list, I was shocked. I was like ‘Oh, okay’. And when I saw the 23-man list, I was very, very happy. Thanks to God, it’s not easy to be here.”\nThe midfielder, who also helped the Super Eagles B team qualify for CHAN after a six-year absence, described the experience as a significant motivation to elevate his game.\n“Seeing the big boys in camp, my first time with the Super Eagles, I’m very, very happy. And seeing them around is a motivation for me to do more, and to show them what I have, and be humble,” he added.\n“They’re all friendly, they encourage everyone. We, the home base, we never felt like we are not among them.”\nLooking ahead to potential playing time, the midfielder expressed confidence in his abilities while acknowledging the importance of seizing any opportunity that comes his way.\n“I know we have everything we need to qualify for the World Cup. We can, and I just pray for the luck. I’ll be very, very happy if I have the chance. And I’ll show Nigeria and the world who I am and what I can do,” Mustapha said.\nThe Niger Tornadoes midfielder also spoke about his approach to learning from his more experienced teammates.\n“I love good footballers. When I see you play, I know I can learn something from you. I admire them, and I pick things I know I need to learn. Just do it for myself,” he concluded.\nNigeria faces Rwanda in Kigali on Friday before hosting Zimbabwe at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium in Uyo four days later, as they aim to improve their position in Group C of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.A",
