  "text": "LUFKIN, Texas (KTRE) - Members of the Lufkin Marine Corps League are preparing to head to Kerrville to assist in the clean-up and recovery process after devastating floods that left over 100 dead and even more still missing.\nThe team said although they are no longer on active or reserve military duty, that doesn’t mean they are idle.\n“As Marines and other military veterans, it’s part of our mission,\" Brian Crews said. “We’re Marines lifelong and our mission is to help in any way, any possible, any way we can. Anyone, anywhere. It’s just what we do.”\nThe team plans to leave at 5 a.m., bringing with them a command trailer full of GPS, communications, and first aid equipment as well as drinking water and rescue equipment.\nCopyright 2025 KTRE.
