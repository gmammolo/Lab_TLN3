  "text": "After the signing of veteran offensive tackle Cam Robinson , the Houston Texans could be in the market for a young receiver in the 2025 NFL Draft. Several prospects could fall outside the top 20 picks and into Nick Caserio's lap with the No. 25 overall pick , thus giving stability to a currently weak receiver room entering 2025. One prospect the Texans should be all over is Ohio State's Emeka Egbuka. Not only is the senior slot target a former teammate of Houston Pro Bowl quarterback C.J. Stroud , but Bleacher Report's Brent Sobleski writes that the Texans need a playmaker built like Egbuka to thrive in new offensive coordinator Nick Caley's system. \"Emeka Egbuka certainly thrived when C.J. Stroud was Ohio State's quarterback,\" Solbeski wrote. \"The receiver's best season on campus came during Stroud's final collegiate campaign. Now, Egbuka can be the reliable threat out of the slot that the Texans don't necessarily have because of Tank Dell's injury history.\" Egbuka, who finished his senior season with 1,011 yards and 10 touchdowns, has always been a supporter of Stroud, crediting him for his growth as a player amid a College Football Playoff run. In 2022, he served as the Buckeyes ' No. 2 target behind eventual first-round pick Marvin Harrison Jr. , hauling in 74 catches for 1,151 and 10 TDs from the eventual No. 2 overall pick. The Texans' instability at the slot receiver spot has made Egubka a fan-favorite pick. Dell's season-ending knee injury also has prioritized the attentiveness to securing a stable No. 2 option behind Nico Collins in the passing game. Egbuka might be high on other teams, especially the Los Angeles Rams , at pick No. 26. If the Texans feel content about their offensive line, targeting the 6-foot Seattle native might be the move that keeps Houston ahead in the AFC South for a third straight division title.
