  "text": "BATON ROUGE, La. ( Louisiana First ) — A woman is recovering after she was struck by lightning in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, last week. Rebekah Prevost was hit by a lightning strike on Thursday, July 3 while running from her vehicle to her home that afternoon. She did not make it inside before she was hit and knocked out. Rebekah said she was bloody, dazed, and had temporary memory loss. When asked about what it felt like to be hit by lightning, she said, “If you have ever heard the buzz of a transformer, imagine how that may feel, like that.” Rebekah was taken to the hospital, where she learned that her injuries included a broken jaw on both sides, a burn on her left hand, bruised knees, a blown ear membrane, a scab on her scalp and burnt hair. She was released from the hospital after four days, and her condition has improved except for lots of pain and tiredness. Rebekah said there was rain, thunder, and lightning prior to her being hit. The lightning hit her favorite cedar tree in the front yard. Rebekah said the lightning hit the tree and then came across a few feet of ground, up her foot and went out the top of her head. “It started storming and I took a picture of some clouds. It was a really pretty cloud formation, and we pulled up at the house and the lightning was going back to back. I have never seen it like that here, and right after we got out of the truck, I told my husband, ‘I’m not going to grab the backpack, I’m just going inside.’ Before I opened the door, I asked God to protect us and I opened the door and that was the last thing I remember,” Rebekah explained. Rebekah’s husband took her inside while hollering to call 911. He did not require medical attention. Samantha Reed said the video below shows the lightning strike that hit her sister, Rebekah. Reed said her outlook has been extremely positive. She is “amazed at her strength and gratefulness.” She added that Rebekah’s “faith has definitely grown stronger and is such a light to others.” Kaden Prevost, Rebekah’s son, was also a witness to the incident. “I was just completely shocked. I was thinking she was dead and I was yelling, ‘Mom, are you okay? Mom, are you okay?’ and she just laid on the ground and she wasn’t speaking. She was just laying on the ground unconscious, and after 15 seconds, she started bolting to the door and ran in the door and ran in the house saying, ‘Call 911,'” Kaden said. ⏩ Read today’s top stories on wkrn.com Rebekah said she feels blessed to be alive. Her recovery will require six to eight weeks of taking in soft foods and liquid, a lot of rest, pain management and doctor appointments. The Baton Rouge woman has a sister, two half-brothers, one half-sister, two daughters, and four boys, the latter of whom live in their home. Rebekah’s sister set up a GoFundMe to help pay for her meals and medical bills. She said they will also be trying to organize plate lunches in the near future.
