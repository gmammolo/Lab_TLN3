  "text": "I f you want to be the best, you have to surround yourself with the best, and it seems Colorado Buffaloes coach Deion Sanders understands that perfectly . Proof of this is his latest addition to his staff, a former NFL Super Bowl champion.\nWho is Deion Sanders' new ally? It's former Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich , who is reportedly joining \"Coach Prime's\" staff, according to NFL insider Jordan Schultz.\nColorado's future QB! Julian \"Ju Ju\" Lewis drops a dime and hits Shedeur Sanders' celebration While there's no official confirmation yet, it's likely that Leftwich will work closely with Colorado's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, Pat Shurmur. Speculation also suggests he could take on a role as an offensive analyst or passing game coordinator.\nLeftwich's Career After playing college football at Marshall, Leftwich was selected as the seventh overall pick in the 2003 NFL Draft by the Jacksonville Jaguars. He played four seasons with Jacksonville (2003-06) before spending time with the Pittsburgh Steelers (2008, 2010-12) and the Buccaneers (2009). Leftwich also served as the backup quarterback to the legendary Ben Roethlisberger when the Steelers won Super Bowl XLIII in 2009.\nTo the limit! Deion Sanders motivates one of his new Colorado quarterbacks by trying to defend him Why hasn't Deion Sanders taken an NFL coaching job?\nLeftwich was spotted at Colorado's spring practice on Tuesday, though his hiring had yet to be officially reported.\nThe Arizona Cardinals gave Leftwich his first coaching opportunity in 2016 as a quarterback coaching intern. He was later promoted to quarterbacks coach in 2017 and served as interim offensive coordinator for part of the 2018 season.\nIn 2019, Leftwich reunited with head coach Bruce Arians as the offensive coordinator of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. His reputation as a coach grew significantly in Tampa Bay, particularly working alongside quarterback Tom Brady, who spent the last three years of his NFL career under Leftwich's offensive leadership. Together, Leftwich, Brady, and the Buccaneers won Super Bowl LV in 2021.",
