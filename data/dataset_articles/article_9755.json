He advised for taking mitigation measures after carrying out expeditions to safeguard the region from any Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF).He reviewed the updated status of the transit accommodations created for the migrant employees in Kashmir Valley. He called for rapid execution of the ongoing works so that all the 6000 flats are allotted to these employees without any further delay.Dulloo also took appraisal of implementation of relief and rehabilitation package being extended to the displaced persons of PoJK/Chhamb and the West Pakistani Refugees by the Central Government.He called for disbursement of relief amounts to all the eligible families and giving opportunity to those who had not yet received the benefits despite being eligible for the same.The Chief Secretary took note of other welfare measures like onboarding of migrants registered with Relief Organisation on NFSA, database for extension of different social security schemes to them.
