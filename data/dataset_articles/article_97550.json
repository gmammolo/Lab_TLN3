I’ve demanded a professional appraisal and equal split to support my daughter’s education, but they’re accusing me of selfishness.

My husband was invited but couldn’t attend due to work. He encouraged me to go and “have a good time,” so I did. However, the entire outing turned sour because he obsessively questioned my location through messages. We share Snapchat locations, and even though the map clearly showed I was at the winery, he fixated on the app’s top-of-screen label, which listed a nearby brewery (likely a glitch or proximity tag).
