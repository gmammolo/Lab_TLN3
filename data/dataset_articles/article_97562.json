  "text": "March 19, 2025 (Langford, BC) – Rugby Canada will participate in the Asuncion 2025 Junior Pan American Games, with a Canadian U20 women’s sevens team coached by Brittany Waters taking to the field at Paraguay’s Olympic Park.\nThe second-ever edition of the Junior Pan American Games will take place August 9 to 23, 2025, in Asuncion, Paraguay, with more than 4000 athletes from 41 countries competing in 28 sports. This will be the first time that rugby sevens, which is scheduled for August 16 and 17, is included in this international multi-sport event for young rising athletes.\nIn the lead up to the Junior Pan American Games, Waters will work in collaboration with Canada’s U20 Women’s Rugby Team and senior national team staff. The team will be announced in July, with preparation including participation in a Next Gen Top 30 camp at Shawnigan Lake School in BC. This camp will involve two weeks of intense training and games for the Junior Pan American Games squad as well as Next Gen players and young talent identified through Rugby Canada’s age grade programming, provincial partners, and U SPORTS.\n“It is an incredible honour to be named the Head Coach of our Junior Pan American Games team and to work with a group of passionate and talented players and staff,” said Waters. “The Junior Pan American Games offer a unique and exciting opportunity to compete at an elite level, and to embrace the energy and spirit of a multi-sport event. Representing Canada on this stage will be an amazing experience for up-and-coming players as they continue their high performance journey.”\nFormer rugby international Waters represented Canada on the world stage from 2008 to 2017, with 39 caps for Canada’s Women’s Rugby Team and three Rugby World Cup appearances. A two-time inductee to Rugby Canada’s Hall of Fame, Waters played for Canada’s Women’s Sevens Team as well, including at two Rugby World Cup Sevens.\nWaters has been the Head Coach of the University of Victoria women’s rugby program for the last 10 years and has experience working with Canada’s Women’s Sevens Team and Rugby Canada age grade programs as an assistant coach. A former University of Victoria player and U SPORTS All-Canadian herself, Waters was named the Canada West Coach of the Year in 2015, her inaugural year as Head Coach, leading the Vikes to their first-ever Canada West championship banner win and their first U SPORTS championship appearance. She most recently led the University of Victoria to back-to-back U SPORTS silver medals.\nMore information on the Asuncion 2025 Junior Pan American Games can be found here, with the event streamed live on the Panam Sports Channel.\nPrior to being named to Team Canada, all nominations are subject to approval by the Canadian Olympic Committee’s Team Selection Committee following its receipt of nominations by all National Sport Organizations.\n-30-\nAbout Rugby Canada\nRugby Canada is the national governing body of the sport of Rugby Union in Canada.
