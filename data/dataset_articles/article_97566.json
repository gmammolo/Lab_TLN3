  "text": "PEORIA, Ariz. — The Rangers on Wednesday lost a game in which both Jacob deGrom pitched and Corey Seager homered, falling 3-2 to Seattle at the Peoria Sports Complex. Don’t expect that to happen much this season.\nBut, despite the star turns by the star players, perhaps the best news of the day is that the back end of the reconstituted bullpen looks just fine. Say it with us: The bullpen is not a mess.\nThe leverage trio of lefty Robert Garcia, Luke Jackson and Chris Martin combined to pitch three perfect innings against Seattle. For the spring, the numbers pop: They have allowed one run in 15 innings of work, struck out 13 and allowed just nine baserunners. Their ERA and WHIP are identical: 0.600. Astonishing.",
