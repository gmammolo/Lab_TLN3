  "text": "Getty Images/Global Images Ukraine. Anthony Joshua\nThe World Boxing Organization (WBO) has officially ordered Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk to defend his title against Joseph Parker.\nWBO President Gustavo Oliveri gave Usyk 30 days to negotiate a fight with Parker.\nThe situation is closely monitored by former world champion Anthony Joshua. AJ and his team hope that Usyk will take the fight with Parker. In this case, Joshua plans to hold his next fight against Daniel Dubois for the IBF heavyweight title.\nLast year, Joshua was sensationally outclassed by Dubois, losing by brutal knockout in the fifth round.\nsport.ua",
