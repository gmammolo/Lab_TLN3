  "text": "Your favorite Portland Trail Blazers podcast is back with another episode this week! On recording date, the Blazers were in the midst of a fairly long losing streak. They hadn’t yet beaten the Washington Wizards and Toronto Raptors. (Not exactly hard chores there!) On this iteration of the Trail Daddy Podcast, we talk about all the good things that have shown up despite the losing, what the Blazers have learned about themselves, and even more critical analysis of Trail Blazers Head Coach Chauncey Billups. The episode has an insight or two that you probably won’t want to miss!\nListen to the show through this link or wherever you get your usual podcasts. Or just click play on the embed below. If you’d like to leave some stars or a review, we’d appreciate that too!\nEnjoy!",
