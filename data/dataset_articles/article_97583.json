  "text": "Add another accolade onto the list for Lubbock Monterey girls basketball star Aaliyah Chavez.\nThe senior state champion guard won the 2024-25 Gatorade National Player of the Year, the sports drink brand announced Wednesday, marking the fifth time one of most prestigious awards in high school hoops has come to Texas. Cypress native Nneka Ogwumike, the 2007-08 winner of the honor, presented Chavez with the award Wednesday morning in a surprise ceremony at the school.\nChavez, the nation’s top-ranked Class of 2025 recruit, had already twice won Texas Gatorade Player of the Year. She also earned National Player of the Year honors from the Naismith Awards and MaxPreps over the past month.\nIn leading the Plainsmen to their first state championship since 1981, Chavez averaged 34.9 points, 9.1 rebounds and 4.3 assists per game this season. Along the way, she developed a large and fervent fan following rare for high school players of any sport.\nChavez plans to announce her college choice Tuesday at Monterey and is considering Texas Tech, Texas, Oklahoma, South Carolina and UCLA.\nBefore Chavez, four other Texas girls basketball players have won Gatorade National Player of the Year, an award which dates back to 1985. Here’s the list of Lone Star State winners:\n- 2024-25: Guard Aaliyah Chavez, Monterey Lubbock\n- 2013-14: Guard/forward Brianna Turner, Manvel\n- 2009-10: Forward Chiney Ogwumike, Cy-Fair\n- 2007-08: Forward Nneka Ogwumike, Cy-Fair\n- 1999-2000: Forward Shereka Wright, Copperas Cove",
