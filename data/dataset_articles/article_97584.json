  "text": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Marquel Sutton shuffled his feet along the center court logo, looking down at the capitalized white lettering underneath him.\nIt was the sight Sutton had anticipated, and it was finally in his vision as Omaha took the court for its open practice in front of a smattering of spectators at Amica Mutual Pavilion.\nReality didn’t set in on the Mavericks’ star forward in the days leading up to their first NCAA tournament game. It wouldn’t, he expected, until he saw the logo, until MARCH MADNESS in block letters was staring back at him from the floor.\nFor Sutton and the Mavs, the tournament experience has been twofold. They want to enjoy the moment and appreciate that they’re in a setting most of the college basketball world doesn’t get to experience. Staying relaxed and having fun feeds into their primary purpose: playing the same brand of basketball that defined their romp through the Summit League, with the possibility of stunning No. 2 seed St. John’s the reward at the end of Thursday night.\n“Just enjoy it,” Sutton said. “Enjoy this experience. Just don’t overthink the game. It’s just stay in the moment and be present and don’t overthink it. We’ve been doing this all our lives. It’s just basketball, so just go out there and have fun and just play hard. That’s the main thing.”\nDifferent flashpoints stick out for different players within the whirlwind of the past four days. For Lance Waddles, it was on Selection Sunday when he saw Omaha’s name flash on the television and it became official that the Mavericks were dancing for the first time in program history.\nIsaac Ondekane understood the glitz and glamor of the tournament when the team had a police escort while on the bus. Tony Osburn had a surreal moment when he walked past Arkansas coach John Calipari and fist-bumped assistant coach Tyler Ulis, who he watched play for Kentucky as a kid.\nThe little moments are part of a gradual process as the game draws nearer, drops in the bucket as Omaha’s name written in the bracket evolves into tangibility.\n“It’s still weird, though,” Waddles said. “Every step it gets more and more real. It’s like, damn, we’re really here.”\nThe Mavericks were loose as they practiced with close to 30 hours remaining until the scheduled tipoff against the Red Storm. Point guard JJ White smiled as he barked at Sebastian Perry at the end of a shooting competition. White’s black-clad team made up of starters had hit 10 3-pointers before Perry’s squad of backups dressed in white, and White grabbed the redshirt freshman as they switched sides.\nAs White closed practice by shooting free throws, the rest of the team gathered around him, laughing and yelling to simulate the chaos of late-game pressure foul shots.\nOmaha coach Chris Crutchfield blew his whistle repeatedly as White went through his pre-shot routine. Forward Kamryn Thomas stood under the basket and waved his arms. Guard Ja’Sean Glover stood inches from White, his head pointed forward toward him as White missed the first and made the second free throw.\n“Realizing that this is not forever, so each and every moment that you have with your teammates and your coaches, when you look back at it, it’s like it’s really an important moment,” Ondekane said. “So that’s really what I’ve been trying to pay attention to. Just the little moments of laughing with each other.”\nRunning parallel to the fun and light-heartedness is an understanding of what it will take to beat the red-hot Red Storm. The Omaha coaching staff began preparation shortly after the Mavs won the Summit League tournament, knowing St. John’s was one of five or six teams they could see in the tournament.\nAs it became clear in the 48 hours before the bracket was revealed that their opponent would be either Michigan State or St. John’s, the focus narrowed. By Monday morning, the players had learned the game plan.\nNow it’s all in front of the Mavericks, even as numbers and history say a win is deeply unlikely. Omaha has nothing to lose against the favored Red Storm and a place in March Madness lore to gain. The team has reflected that dynamic, enjoying the ride while simultaneously appreciating the view from March.\n“I don’t think they think about it as much as the coaching staff or the people around,” Crutchfield said. “They just go show up and play. They’ve been really locked in and really focused on this one. I expect the same thing on Thursday night.”",
