  "text": "In response to the severe flooding that recently struck Central Texas, Ford Motor Company announced coordinated recovery efforts alongside its employees, dealers and nonprofit partners to aid affected communities in Kerr and Tom Green counties.\nFord and its Building Together nonprofit network are providing essential relief services, including managing shelters and reunification centers, and distributing emergency food supplies. The initiative aims to assist both displaced families and first responders navigating the aftermath of the disaster.\n“We’re heartbroken by the devastation in Central Texas following the recent floods,” Ford stated in a news release. “Our thoughts are with the families who are grieving the loss of loved ones, and we recognize that the recovery from this terrible event will take time.”\nAs the Ford community rallies together in support of Texas, other efforts include:\n• Texas Ford dealers and Ford Philanthropy are donating a combined $1.25 million to support local organizations in Central Texas. This donation will support the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country and local affiliates of Building Together partners.\n• Ford dealers are providing loaner vehicles to the American Red Cross to power their recovery efforts. The loaner vehicle program is enabling partners to expand and scale response efforts to reach impacted areas.\n• Ford employees are packing food boxes to support families in Texas. On July 17, Ford employees and dealers will come together at the North Texas Food Bank, a partner in the Feeding America network, to pack food boxes to support local Texas families, including those who may have been impacted by the recent floods.\n• Ford Volunteer Corps members are preparing to deploy to Texas with Team Rubicon. Through the company’s Extended Volunteer Paid Time Off Policy, “Greyshirt” trained Ford volunteers are preparing to join Team Rubicon’s mission on the ground as their recovery efforts begin in Texas.\n• Ford Credit is offering deferred payment to our customers in FEMA-designated areas. Ford Credit and Lincoln Automotive Financial Services are helping customers affected by the severe storms, straight-line winds and tragic flooding in Texas by offering payment extensions of up to 60 days. Customers can request an extension by visiting www.ford.com/finance or through the Ford Credit app.\nThe company is encouraging financial donations to five key organizations involved in the relief efforts:\nFord also expressed its appreciation for the nonprofit partners and first responders “who are on the ground working tirelessly to help those who need it most.” The automaker said its teams and affiliates will continue to support the region in the weeks and months ahead.",
