  "text": "Three-time MVP Shohei Ohtani continues to do things that the baseball world has never seen.\nAhead of the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Opening Day contest in Japan, Ohtani was honored with his own character in the mega-popular video game, Fortnite .\nMore news: Dodgers Option James Outman, 2 Pitchers to Triple-A\nAfter winning a World Series ring in his first season with L.A., and becoming the first player in MLB history to hit 50 or more home runs and steal 50 or more bases in a season, Ohtani has set another first as Fortnite’s first baseball player to be given his own character.\nHe joined the likes of LeBron James, Lionel Messi, Patrick Mahomes, and other world-famous athletes getting a “skin” in the game for users to play with.\nOhtani is honored to be linked with such company in the popular video game.\n“Honestly, I’m very honored,” Ohtani said via SI.com’s Tom Verducci . “Obviously, there are so many great players out there, and to be chosen as the ambassador of this globally well-known game, it’s truly an honor.”\nAs he joins the exclusive list, he also opened up about potentially getting back to playing Fortnite, presumably at a high level given his dominance in just about everything he does.\n“Recently I haven’t been able to play too much,” said the MVP. “Before, in the past I did play a lot more. I did play with my teammates. Obviously by chatting you get to communicate with your teammates. So, I really had a great experience playing games with my teammates. And now that this game is coming out, I think I might have to start taking it up again and start playing again.”\nEven in something as trivial as a video game, Ohtani is able to find ways to improve teammate synergy and improve communication around the clubhouse.\nThe Ohtani character in Fortnite comes with Dodgers home and away uniforms, a LEGO version of the slugger, a Samurai outfit, and even a bobblehead based on Decoy, Ohtani’s beloved dog.\nMore news: Longtime Evaluator Says Bobby Witt is Best Player in World Over Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani\nPhoto Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\nHave you joined our Discord Channel yet?
