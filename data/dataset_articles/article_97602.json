  "text": "Phoenix Suns rookie Ryan Dunn has been a bright spot for an underperforming team this season.\nA lot of the criticism around the Phoenix Suns this season has been warranted. They did not expect to be sitting in 11th place in the Western Conference at this stage of the season.\nUdonis Haslem called the Suns out for not adding enough talented players around Kevin Durant , Devin Booker and Bradley Beal.\nBut arguably one move the Suns did get right, was picking up Ryan Dunn in the 2024 NBA Draft.\nDunn scored 17 points in the recent win over the Raptors, just short of his career high of 18 set in January.\nMonday 18th March Phoenix Suns Phoenix Suns 129 | 89 Toronto Raptors Toronto Raptors Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images Playing alongside Kevin Durant Ryan Dunn has been speaking about the early stages of his NBA career, and the dream experience of getting to play alongside two-time champion Kevin Durant .\nSpeaking to the Run Your Race podcast, Dunn admitted: “KD’s my favorite player.”\nAsked about what it is like playing with and practicing with Durant, Dunn says his approach is trying to soak up as much information as possible.\nDunn said: “He doesn’t really miss, every rep is the same, I think he does so well, and I’m learning, I’m grateful to have him, Devin and Brad, I’m learning, I’m seeing how he is in the game. I’m observing, and I need to ask more questions but I really like to watch, and see how they really work.\n“They really imagine themselves picking spots, where to go.\n“Seeing him at work every day, you understand why he’s Kevin Durant. You see it, he’s not picking up any nonsense, he’s serious when it comes to his work.”\nDunn says Durant got him involved in practice and shootaround straight away, and helped to build his confidence to make the step up. But he says most of all, he still likes to watch and learn.\nHe added: “Watching him that’s great, I always watched him growing up, it’s surreal to have him as a teammate.”\nDurant has set such high standards in his career that he gets criticism if his teams are not winning games, that comes with the territory of being a superstar. But the reverence his young teammate holds in him is a reminder of what he has achieved, and the respect he is held in by his peers.\nDunn added that there was crucial advice he received from Durant: “During training camp, we’re going, me and him. There were times where I would pass up on a shot and KD would be like ‘what the ___ are you doing, shoot the ball. I need you to shoot that.’”\nRyan Dunn says he expected to be drafted to one of three teams Ryan Dunn also reflected on his NBA Draft experience, which ultimately saw him drafted to the Phoenix Suns. He was taken 28th by the Denver Nuggets , who traded him to his eventual destination.\nDunn said there were three teams he had heard might be keen, the Celtics, Suns and Knicks, with his biggest focus being on the latter.\nHe said: “I had a feeling. My three were Boston, Phoenix and New York. I’m a New York kid. I’m hearing all this stuff.\n“Phoenix didn’t come in until later in the process, the last couple of days.”\nHe said he was ‘stressed’ when the Knicks passed on him and took Pacome Dadiet at 26 instead, before his eventual path took him to the Phoenix Suns.",
