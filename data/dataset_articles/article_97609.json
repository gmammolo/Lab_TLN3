  "text": "Sports Fans and students give RMU an enthusiastic send-off as they head to the NCAA Tournament By Cassidy Wood Updated on: March 19, 2025 / 6:30 PM EDT / CBS Pittsburgh\nIreland Contracting Nightly Sports Call: March 17, 2025 Ireland Contracting Nightly Sports Call: March 17, 2025 17:57 Robert Morris is set to take on Alabama on Friday afternoon in the first round of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament .\nOn campus in Moon Township on Wednesday, it was a big farewell for the Colonials as they headed to Cleveland for the matchup.\nAs you can imagine, fans and students were excited, hoping RMU would get that \"one shining moment\" but it will be a tough task, taking on one of, if not the toughest, offenses in college basketball right now.\n\"The principles and the terminology and the execution of what we need to do, they know what that is,\" said Head Coach Andy Toole. \"You've got to be able to do it at the highest level that you've done it all year long. That's what's great about this tournament, and this season, the challenges just get bigger and bigger as the year goes on.\"\nHowever, it's a good thing that Robert Morris has based a lot of its success this season on defense, finishing the season with a strong turnover margin and the best defensive player in their conference this year.\n\"It definitely is Alabama but at the end of the day, it is just another basketball game,\" said Josh Momjafo. \"If you look at it like that, you start to think about different things, but like I said, it's just a basketball game. Same basketball we've played since we were kids.\"\n\"We wouldn't be here without our defense and I feel like that's a big part of why we've been winning,\" added Kam Woods. \"To stop them, you have to play defense, the teams that have beaten them, they stopped them. We just have to get ready, lock-in, and be ready to guard.\"\nWoods is an Alabama native and said that his phone has been blowing up since Sunday\n\"To be able to showcase my defensive skills at a higher level, against a higher opponent, it's always a great opportunity,\" said Amarion Dickerson, a Cleveland native who added it will be nice to get home.\nIn all, the team said the support has been unbelievable.\nRobert Morris and Alabama will tip off at 12:40 p.m. on Friday but they will have a practice on Thursday in Cleveland.\nWe'll be there on Friday to bring you all the coverage from Cleveland.\nMore from CBS News Robert Morris campus abuzz with excitement ahead of March Madness game Last-second layup leads Alabama State to 70-68 win over St. Francis in First Four Robert Morris to play Alabama in first round of 2025 NCAA Tournament St. Francis facing Alabama St. in First Four matchup of NCAA Tournament West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey to investigate WVU's absence from NCAA Tournament In: College Basketball NCAA Tournament",
