  "text": "Arriving into Sydney this week, I feel like I'm in full flow and full rhythm after a positive few weeks - and, overall, a good season so far - with St Pauli.\nIt's great to be at a stage of my career where I’m performing at the highest level that I've played at, but definitely feeling at home and confident there. The longer the season’s gone on, the more I have that belief in myself, that I belong at this level.\nAnd to be able to bring that momentum and confidence into this camp with the Socceroos is exciting.\nThe general feeling amongst the boys in camp has been great and very positive all week heading into today’s game.\nThe March window is always quite a special one, because you have those three back-to-back windows at the end of the year, and then there’s this big four or five-month break, before you all come back together.\nAll the boys return with a different kind of energy, a different feeling. And we’ve definitely had that throughout this camp. There’s a calmness and confidence in the way we’re going about our business.\nPreparations have been great all week. Everybody was dialled in straight away. That's been one of the things the boss has brought into camp since he arrived - the intensity is so high and everybody is on it from the moment they come through the door.\nEverything is geared towards being ready to perform on matchday.\nEvery game is important, but of course, a home game tonight in the context of this group, even more so.\nBut that’s what you want as a footballer - high pressure, high stakes, that's the best part about the game and what we do.\nGetting the three points is our goal each and every time we step out onto the pitch for the Socceroos. So naturally, six points is what we’re aiming for this window.\nWe arrive into every camp believing we can win every game. And that’s the way it has to be.\nWe’ve got a few players missing through injury, but that’s the nature of the game. And as we’ve seen before, that presents an opportunity for other players to emerge.\nThe beauty of this team is that you've got these young players that have burst onto the scene, and then you have more experienced players like Jason Geria and Anthony Caceres - who have been top players for a long time - but have had to wait for that opportunity. They’ve come in and performed to a very high level.\nThen there are also players like Jason Davidson, who has been a part of this team in big moments across our history, in Asian Cups and World Cups, and finds himself back here once again at another key moment for us.\nIt shows you that the boss will give those opportunities to whoever he feels deserves it in that moment and then you have to be ready. No one's out of the picture.\nAnd when you earn that call-up - because not everyone gets the chance - you’ve got to be ready to take it.\nThe messaging from our coaching staff has been clear. Just to really buy into the way that we want to play, to understand the structure and then execute the game plan with calmness, belief and confidence. When we do it right, we’re capable of beating any team.\nHome games in any sport and in any environment are so important because of the fans - that’s what makes football such a special game.\nSo, I hope everyone's as up for it as we are, gets here early, wears their Green and Gold, and brings that spark that can give us that something extra in what is another crucial World Cup qualifier.\nEverything we do as Socceroos, the fans are always a huge part of.\nWe do what we do for our families, for our friends, but ultimately, we do it for our fans and for our country. We want to represent you proudly.\nWhen you can give us that extra spark, it brings the best out in us on the pitch.\nI can’t wait to see you all there tonight and one thing I can promise is we’ll do everything we possibly can to get the right result for you and for Australia.\nTweet: https://twitter.com/Socceroos/status/1902465106484592952\nMATCH DETAILS\nSubway Socceroos v Indonesia\nThursday, 20 March 2025\nSydney Football Stadium, Sydney\nKick-off: 8.00pm AEDT\nTickets: Available via Ticketek\nBroadcast: 10, 10 Play and Paramount+\nChina PR v Subway Socceroos\nTuesday 25 March 2025\nHangzhou Olympic Sports Centre Stadium, Hangzhou\nKick-off: 7.00pm local / 10.00pm AEDT\nBroadcast: Paramount+",
