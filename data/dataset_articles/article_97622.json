  "text": "Jason Kidd provides positive injury update on Mavericks superstar before Pacers game\nThe Dallas Mavericks have been dealing with injuries all across the roster since trading Luka Doncic away to the Los Angeles Lakers. The key return from that trade, Anthony Davis, went down with an adductor strain in the third quarter of his debut in Dallas and hasn't played since. But Dallas has remained optimistic that he could return before the end of the season and sent him down to the G-League's Texas Legends to practice earlier in the week.\nPrior to Wednesday's matchup against the Indiana Pacers, Mavs head coach Jason Kidd provided an update on Davis.\nREAD MORE: Longest tenured Maverick's time with team may soon come to an end\n\"He's trending in the right place,\" Kidd said to the media. \"He had a positive experience in the practice. He'll continue to do things this week. Hopefully, the outcome continues to be positive. A lot of good things, but he's still some time away for him being in a game.\"\nThere is a concern about whether or not Davis could re-aggravate the injury if he returns too soon, and there's also the thought about whether it would even be worth it. The Mavericks are clinging to the 10th seed and the final spot in the Play-In Tournament, but without Kyrie Irving, who tore his ACL a few weeks ago, their playoff ceiling is severely limited. Some fans believe the team would be better off tanking for a better draft pick.\nREAD MORE: Anthony Davis catches heat from Mavericks fans after golfing during injury recovery\nStick with MavericksGameday for more FREE coverage of the Dallas Mavericks throughout the 2024-25 Season\nFollow MavericksGameday on Twitter and Austin Veazey on Twitter",
