  "text": "There is a new No. 1 in class of 2026 college football recruiting rankings after a massive commitment on Wednesday.\nHead coach Lincoln Riley and the USC Trojans previously held the top spot after jumping the Oregon Ducks on March 10. However, USC's lead was short lived, as five-star wide receiver Tristen Key's commitment has shaken things up atop the rankings.\nKeys plays for Hattiesburg (Mississippi) High School. The 6-foot-2.5, 185-pound wideout is rated as the No. 1 wide receiver, the No. 1 player in the state and the No. 3 recruit overall, per On3 composite rankings.\nMultiple college football powerhouses were in the hunt for a pledge from Keys before Wednesday's announcement, including LSU, Alabama, Miami, Texas A&M and Tennessee.\nBut it was the Tigers and head coach Brian Kelly that received the good news from Keys, who committed to LSU as the latest highly-coveted wide receiver to join the fold in Baton Rouge.\nDespite having only seven commitments, including Keys, LSU's 2026 class has jumped USC for the No. 1 spot (On3). The Trojans hold the most commitments in the nation with 15.\nBREAKING: Five-Star WR Tristen Keys has Committed to LSU, he tells me for\n— Hayes Fawcett (@Hayesfawcett3)[@on3recruits]\nThe No. 1 WR in the ‘26 Class chose the Tigers over Tennessee, Alabama, & Texas A&M\n“Once A Tiger, Always A Tiger[#WRTS]”[https://t.co/r9n15cVAMP][pic.twitter.com/HhGoLRPYLA][March 19, 2025]\nKelly and Co. appear to have kept momentum rolling after signing the No. 9 class in the 2025 cycle, as the Tigers currently hold the lead over USC, Oregon, Texas A&M and Auburn for 2026.\nWhile there is still a wealth of time left in the cycle, LSU contending for the nation's top class is a welcomed sign for Tigers' faithful after a four-loss season in 2024.\nLSU began spring practice last week and will culminate the period with a practice open to fans on April 12.\nThe Tigers will open the 2025 season at Clemson on Aug. 30.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
