  "text": "New Bucs inside linebacker Anthony Walker Jr. was brought in because he has experience defending the pass. That’s an area where the Bucs struggled heavily in last season and desperately need to improve. What exact kind of role that Walker will have remains to be seen, but he’s ready for everything and to take on as much responsibility as possible.\n“The Mike linebacker has always been the quarterback of the defense,” Walker said. “A lot is demanded of you, a lot is required and I enjoy doing that job. It’s a position that I grew to love once I got to college switching from DB to linebacker and been playing it ever since. Knowing what comes with the job, the work that you got to put in, I’m willing to put in the work, I’ve been doing it. The opportunity presented itself for me to be here and I want to take full advantage.”\nAs Walker mentioned, he used to play defensive back before moving to inside linebacker at Northwestern. His understanding of pass coverage goes much further than that, though. Walker’s dad, Anthony Sr, was an offensive coach at his high school. Walker Jr. himself even played quarterback on offense. The ability to break down the game was much smoother for him than others.\n“I’ve been very fortunate to see the game from many different lenses,” Walker said. “My dad being an offensive coach and head coach at my high school, playing defense all these years, obviously playing offense, I even played quarterback growing up and in high school. Kind of got many lenses that I view the game from. But as a linebacker for me it’s all about spacial awareness. Whatever the defensive call is at that point, what are we trying to defend and what are we allowing the offense, letting them take the check down.\n“I think that’s where it all starts for me is just processing what we’re trying to get done on defense and how the offense can attack us and being able to beat them to the punch knowing they can only attack certain parts of the field.”\nWalker has four career interceptions and 21 pass breakups through eight seasons. The hope is for the Bucs that he can lean into that a bit more this season.\nAfter the Bucs’ media spoke with Walker via zoom on Wednesday afternoon, it’s evident that he’s a prideful player. He takes it personal when the ball is his thrown his way or even around the area he’s covering. He knows what he has to do with the Bucs and what they expect from him.\n“Defense is all about just knowing where your spot is, and everyone knowing where their spot is,” Walker says. “Understanding how offenses can attack and make sure we limit those gains when they do throw it there. Obviously it starts with me doing my job. My job is to cover the middle of the field.”\n“I pride myself on not allowing the ball to be thrown deep behind me or deep in front of me. That’s my job and that’s me knowing what the defensive call is and executing my job at that time whether it’s I’m blitzing or I’m dropping in coverage or I’m stopping the run, whatever it is. You just want to execute your job.\nWhile Walker may know a lot about coverage, his grades on on Pro Football Focus don’t necessarily agree with him. He had an overall grade of 48.0 at inside linebacker with a run stopping grade of 69.5 but pass defense grade of 39.1. Walker took it on himself to mention those that have criticized him on social media encouraging that if everyone watches the tape, it’ll tell them a different story.\n‘I see all the stuff on social media and everything where people will be like ‘Oh, his PFF grade,’ and all that,” Walker said. “I’m here to tell you, you can watch the film, the ball does not get completed in front of me or in the middle of the field. That’s how I feel.”\nIf anything, the Bucs will have a motivated player this year.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams. Emailed daily.
