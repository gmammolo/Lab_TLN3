  "text": "The North Carolina Tar Heels rolled past the San Diego State Aztecs in their First Four matchup on Tuesday night, with the final score settling in at 95-68. However, just because they won doesn't mean that Jay Bilas feels any differently about North Carolina's inclusion in the 2025 NCAA Tournament.\nThe Tar Heels were among the most controversial picks for the bracket this year, as folks felt they were undeserving of earning a bid for the tournament. Their athletic director, Bubba Cunningham, (who is also the chairman of the NCAA Tournament selection committee) addressed the decision after facing backlash from fans.\n\"The last four teams that were out ... it was a tough call,\" Cunningham said. \"The next team out was West Virginia, and they had an outstanding year and, unfortunately, knowing Tucker DeVries was hurt, player availability is something that we talk about quite a bit. Indiana was close, Ohio State was close, Boise (State) was close.\"\nFor one game at least, the Tar Heels looked like they belonged in the tournament. In Bilas' eyes, though, one win doesn't justify their inclusion in the bracket of 64 teams, especially when considering several other worthy teams were passed over in favor of North Carolina.\n\"What happens in the tournament doesn't validate your inclusion, and it doesn't say that if a No. 1 seed loses in the first or second round that they didn't belong in the tournament or didn't deserve their No. 1 seed, it's based on your body of work,\" Bilas said on \"First Take.\"\n\"What happens in the tournament doesn't validate your inclusion.\"\n— First Take (@FirstTake)[@JayBilas]and[@MadDogUnleashed]on if UNC proved that they belong in the NCAA tournament after their win against San Diego State.[pic.twitter.com/Y3jUgJrWn4][March 19, 2025]\nChances are the Tar Heels won't care too much what people are saying about them, so long as they keep on winning. They will have another shot to prove they belong in the NCAA Tournament when they take on the Ole Miss Rebels in their Round of 64 matchup on Friday, March 21 at 4:05 p.m. EST.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
