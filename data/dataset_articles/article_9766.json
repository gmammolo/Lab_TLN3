  "text": "About $7.3 million in state grants will be going to help four western North Carolina communities rebuild after Hurricane Helene, officials said Thursday.\nFive projects in Chimney Rock will receive the lion’s share of the grant funds — a total of $5.5 million — but Clyde, Gamewell and Morganton also will get money for tasks that help small businesses by fixing damaged infrastructure, the North Carolina Commerce Department said in a news release .\nThe projects include replacing damaged sections of streets in Chimney Rock, which was hit particularly hard by Helene , to improve safety and access to the town’s business district and rehabilitating a Morganton boardwalk that connects to riverfront businesses, the agency said.\n\"Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, especially in western North Carolina, and this first round of infrastructure grants marks another important milestone on the road to recovery,” said Gov. Josh Stein said in the release. “I thank the legislature for funding these infrastructure investments.”\nThe Commerce Department recovery program uses money set aside by the General Assembly early this year for disaster recovery.\nLawmakers last month approved another round of storm relief funding — putting $700 million into a state fund and sending $500 million of that to recovery efforts in western North Carolina — and Stein signed the measure June 27 during the reopening of Chimney Rock State Park.\nThe iconic park had been closed since the storm struck in September.",
