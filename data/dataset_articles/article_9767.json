  "text": "WILMINGTON, LOS ANGELES, July 10 (KNN) – A partial tunnel collapse occurred just before 8 p.m. Wednesday at the Clearwater Tunnel Wastewater Management Project near Lomita Boulevard and Figueroa Street in the Wilmington neighborhood of Los Angeles, temporarily trapping over two dozen workers nearly 400 feet underground, and five miles into the tunnel, according to authorities. The incident happened approximately five to six miles into the massive 18-foot-diameter tunnel, where crews have been operating a self-contained tunnel boring machine (TBM) to construct an 18-foot-diameter sewer tunnel that will eventually reach White Point in San Pedro. Officials say a failure in the tunnel lining occurred behind the TBM, triggering the collapse and cutting off the workers’ direct path to safety. Twenty-seven individuals operating near the boring machine were initially trapped. Four additional workers descended into the tunnel to assist, and all 31 were ultimately able to self-rescue with guidance and support from the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD), which was on scene within minutes of the report. The workers reportedly had to navigate through a debris-filled section of the tunnel to exit the compromised area. LAFD personnel assisted in the evacuation, utilizing an on-site crane and basket system to extract all individuals from the tunnel shaft safely. The Clearwater Project tunnel runs deep beneath the South Bay — nearly 400 feet underground, making rescue efforts complex and hazardous. The TBM, described as a self-contained unit with an air supply, had been steadily making progress on the $630 million regional wastewater system upgrade before the incident halted operations. Emergency responders are currently assessing the integrity of the surrounding tunnel and ensuring the site is secure before allowing further entry. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries, though all rescued personnel are undergoing medical evaluations as a precaution. The LAFD and project engineers are collaborating to determine the cause of the collapse and assess the tunnel’s condition before construction resumes.
