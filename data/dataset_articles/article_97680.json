  "text": "He made the shot that won the game and saved the night, and Brandon Ingram wanted to share it with the fans.\n“This is why I’m here,” he bellowed in the Scotiabank Arena after a buzzer-beating basket led the Raptors to a 97-95 win over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night.\nWell, words to that effect.\n“That’s as clean as I can say it,” Ingram revealed during a post-game chat with reporters. The actually spoken words might have been a bit saucier.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW But what they were announced that Ingram is as advertised, a lethal late-game bucket-getter who lives for such situations.\nAs soon as the Raptors got the ball in that final possession, when coach Darko Rajakovic eschewed a timeout, it was going to be Ingram’s shot to win the game.\n“Everybody knows why B.I. is here, and what he does for our team, and there’s no secret there,” Rajakovic said.\nNo secret to Ingram, either.\n“Yeah, it means a lot,” he said after his 26-point game. “Like I’ve said, (Rajakovic is) the leader of our team. He brings the energy every single day, and he’s been very transparent with what he wants on the basketball floor.\n“So for him to let the go-ahead basket go, you know, it’s not only confident for me, but it’s trust. It’s trust between the two (of us).”\nThe win was big on several angles. It extended Toronto’s winning streak to eight games in a row and 13 of the last 14. And, combined with Miami’s win over Milwaukee, it ensured the Raptors will host an Emirates NBA Cup quarterfinal on either Dec. 9 or 10, a one-game showdown against an opponent still to be determined that will be the biggest game the franchise has played in almost three years.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Wednesday’s win proved the Raptors can win despite not playing nearly their best. They shot a miserable 39 per cent from the floor and were 5-for-26 (19 per cent) from three-point range.\nThey needed a 22-0 run bridging the end of the second quarter and the start of the third to get back into the game and made two big defensive plays — a blocked shot by Jakob Poeltl and a turnover on a midcourt violation caused by Scottie Barnes — to save the game.\nSlow start, short start Raptors rookie Collin Murray-Boyles was moved into the starting lineup in the absence of the usual starter, RJ Barrett. It didn’t last long.\nAfter picking up two personal fouls in the first 3:16, Murray-Boyles was subbed out and didn’t get on the court for the rest of the first half. Ja’Kobe Walter started the second half in his place and Murray-Boyles sat for the first 10 minutes of the third quarter.\nA big reason was that Walter continued his resurgent play, hitting three three-pointers in a 13-point game that also included four rebounds and two steals.\n“He’s the kid that puts a lot of work in,” Rajakovic said. “He’s getting better opportunities there. He knows that we have his back, and he’s our product of this organization.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW “He understands the culture and how we want to play … and he brings the juice to the team every day. So really, really happy for him.”\nA tough spot The season-long absence of star guard Tyrese Haliburton has changed everything for the defending Eastern Conference-champion Pacers.\nAnd no one’s felt it more than Aurora’s Andrew Nembhard , who has assumed a giant role with Haliburton out as he rehabs a torn Achilles tendon.\n“(It’s) very challenging but, in life, the greatest growth opportunities come when you’re most challenged,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said of Nembhard. “There’s a lot to be learned here, but it’s not easy, it’s not easy, and we’re looking to help him as much as we can.\n“However, our present situation is a little limiting in that way. We just gotta make the best of it and work to get better every day.”\nNembhard is averaging career highs in scoring (more than 18 points per game), field goal attempts (about 14 per game) and minutes (more than 30 per game) while filling in for Haliburton.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Banged up Gradey Dick was lost to the Raptors for the final three quarters after he took a hard fall under the basket late in the first quarter chasing an offensive rebound.\n“Grady is feeling fine,” Rajakovic said. “We just kept him (on the bench) out of precaution there.”\nThe third-year wing has been in a prolonged shooting slump, especially from three-point range. Including two missed threes in his seven minutes Wednesday, Dick is just seven-for-31 (22.5 per cent) from beyond the arc in his last 10 games.",
