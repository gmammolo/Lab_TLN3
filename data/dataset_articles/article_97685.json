  "text": "Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) defeated Tottenham at home, and PSG coach Luis Enrique did not hide his satisfaction. At the same time, he also spoke to jolt any players who might become complacent.PSG beat Tottenham 5-3 in a high-scoring home match at Parc des Princes in Paris on the 27th (Korea time) in the 2025-2026 UEFA Champions League group stage, matchday 5.With the result, PSG moved up to second in the UCL group stage with a 4-1 record (12 points, goal difference +11). After starting the tournament with three straight UCL wins and then taking its first loss on the 5th, falling 1-2 to Bayern Munich, PSG bounced back. The leader is Arsenal, who are on a five-match winning streak after defeating Bayern Munich (15 points).Lee Kang-in started the match on the bench. He was brought on in the 56th minute for Bradley Barcola and spent about 30 minutes on the pitch.Lee Kang-in, who had earned praise for registering attacking contributions in two consecutive Ligue 1 matches, did not record any attacking stats against Tottenham. But he showcased his sharp corner-kick ability and played a role in creating a goal.Tottenham opened the scoring. Richarlison headed in the opener in the 35th minute of the first half, giving Tottenham the lead over PSG.PSG, who had been trailing, equalized in the 45th minute just before the end of the first half when Vitinha produced a spectacular long-range strike to make it 1-1.The momentum shifted dramatically at the start of the second half. In the 50th minute, Tottenham went ahead through Randal Kolo Muani. Muani is a forward who left PSG this season to play for Tottenham on loan.PSG quickly restored the balance. In the 53rd minute, a left-footed shot from the center of the penalty area beat Tottenham's goalkeeper to make the score 2-2.In the 56th minute, PSG brought on Lee Kang-in.In the 59th minute, PSG stole the ball in Tottenham's half with intense high pressing to create an opportunity. Fábian Luis finished with a left-footed shot to complete the turnaround and put PSG ahead 3-2.Lee Kang-in played a part in the chance for an added goal. In the 65th minute, his sharp corner from the left created chaos in the penalty area. Willian Pacho pushed the ball in with his right foot from the left side of the goal area. PSG went up 4-2.In the 67th minute, Lee Kang-in attempted a direct left-footed long-range shot from the right side of the penalty arc. Unfortunately, the shot was saved by the Tottenham goalkeeper.PSG conceded again in the 73rd minute after a passing error by Vitinha allowed Muani to score, cutting the lead to 4-3. But Vitinha made up for his mistake himself. In the 75th minute, during a shooting situation, he won a penalty when Tottenham defender Cristian Romero committed a handball foul. Taking the penalty, he calmly converted it to complete his hat trick. With that goal, PSG stretched the lead to 5-3.Late in the match there was a variable when defender Lucas Hernández was sent off. But PSG held on for the remaining time and kept the three points.After the match, Enrique began his interview by praising the opponent, saying, “There are no easy games in the Champions League,” and “Tottenham also played a really good game. Their defensive organization in the first half was excellent.”PSG turned the game around thanks to Vitinha's first career hat trick and goals from Willian Pacho and Fábian Luis. Even after conceding multi-goals to Richarlison and Kolo Muani, they ultimately celebrated.Enrique said, “We showed a complete performance. I want to congratulate the fans. The atmosphere they create even in difficult moments is amazing. It’s natural that we have this mentality. And our home stadium gives an incredible force.”He also added an explanation regarding the recently mentioned players' lack of concentration. He said, “What I said was not directed at the players. It meant that we need to focus on the future. I know how focused the players are in training,” while also emphasizing, “I cannot accept players who lose the right attitude.”[OSEN]",
