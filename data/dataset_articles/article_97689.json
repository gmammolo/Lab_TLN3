  "text": "PSG head coach Luis Enrique shared his thoughts following the Champions League match against Tottenham, where his team secured a 5–3 victory. During the game, the Parisian club fell behind 0–1 and 1–2 but managed to claim the win in the end.\nThe hero of the night was midfielder Vitinha, who scored a hat-trick. \"We showed great character.\nIt was a very tough match; we fought against a complex opponent. Tottenham played exceptionally well, especially in the first half, and maintained a solid defense.\nVitinha is growing alongside the entire team. He is unique and extraordinary as a player.\nI am very happy for him; he truly deserves this result,\" Enrique stated in his interview with UEFA. PSG is currently in second place in the group standings with 12 points, while Arsenal leads with 15 points.\nRead “Zamin” on Telegram!",
