  "text": "Young talent from Anuradhapura stamped their class at the recently concluded Prima Sunrise Bread Regional Golf Championship in Nuwara Eliya last weekend, showing a bright future for junior golf in Sri Lanka.\nLeading the charge was Adithya Weerasinghe, originally from Anuradhapura and now representing Ananda College, who clinched the Boys’ Gold Division title. His steady progress and growing consistency have already placed him on the pathway to earning world ranking points, signalling immense potential at international level.\nIn the Silver Division, Lavidu Premarathna continued the region’s dominance with an impressive victory, while Vihara Herath delivered a commanding performance to secure the Girls’ Bronze segment title.\nOne of the most exciting prospects is Abhiman Abeywardhana, who triumphed in the Copper Division, and previously won the Rukmini Kodagoda Trophy while finishing runner-up at the Prima Regional event. His rapid rise suggests a promising future on the big stage. (SJ)",
