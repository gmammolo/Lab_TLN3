  "text": "Sport\nUCL: ‘Most complete performance I’ve seen’ – Martin Keown names Arsenal’s best player in 3-1 win\nArsenal legend, Martin Keown, has singled out midfielder, Declan Rice for special praise following Arsenal’s 3-1 victory over Bayern Munich.\nHe noted that last night’s performance from the midfielder was perhaps the ‘most complete performance’ of his career.\nJurrien Timber put the Premier League title chasers in front in the 22nd minute, heading home Bukayo Saka’s inswinging corner but Lennart Karl waited for only 10 minutes to fire in the equaliser for the Germans.\nNoni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli came off the bench at the Emirates Stadium to add two more goals to ensure victory for the home side.\nFormer Arsenal defender, Keown who was on punditry duty with TNT Sports, said, “I was out of my seat in that second half.\n“He was galloping around that pitch. It was as if they gave him the keys to the city.\n“It was the most complete performance that I’ve seen this young man play.”\nThe victory over Bayern Munich meant the Gunners are now three points clear at the top of the table after five group matches.\nUp next for Arsenal is a Premier League clash with Chelsea this weekend.",
