  "text": "Monaco fullback Jordan Teze says he’s confident Paul Pogba will be included in the France squad for the 2026 World Cup.\nRecall that Pogba made his much-anticipated debut for Monaco in Saturday’s defeat at Rennes, marking a first competitive appearance in over two years due to injury and a doping ban.\nSpeaking with L’Equipe, Teze stated that the former Manchester United midfielder will make a return to the France squad before next summer’s World Cup.\nRead Also:UCL: It’s A Good Victory –Lookman Reacts After Atalanta Win Vs Frankfurt\n“Paul is 32, but he exudes happiness, freshness, and desire. He’s still young.\n“At first, I was more impressed by him, because Paul wasn’t yet in his stride.\n“But now you can see that Paul is back to being Paul. He’s not at his best yet, but with the consistency in his matches… (he can make the World Cup squad)”",
