  "text": "Grand Canyon University defeated Utah in a commanding 68-58 victory last night. The win sends the Lopes to the Acrisure Classic championship game tonight. They will face the undefeated Iowa Hawkeyes for the title.\nThis semifinal matchup was a showcase of defensive grit. GCU won despite a complete absence of three-pointers, a first in their Division I history.\nHistoric Win Without a Three-Pointer\nGrand Canyon achieved a rare feat in modern basketball. They became the first team this season to win a game without making a single three-point shot. The Lopes went 0-for-10 from beyond the arc.\nThey compensated with relentless drives to the basket and stifling defense. According to ESPN’s game statistics, GCU scored 62 of their 68 points either in the paint or from the free-throw line.\nThe team’s ball security was exceptional. They committed only six turnovers, compared to Utah’s 14. This gave them a significant possession advantage throughout the contest.\nHenley’s Bench Spark and Defensive Lockdown\nJaden Henley provided a massive offensive spark off the bench. The senior guard led all scorers with 18 points, attacking the rim with purpose.\nHenley was efficient, drawing fouls and converting 8 of his 9 free throw attempts. His early energy, including two quick steals and dunks, set the game’s physical tone.\nDefensively, the Lopes were superb. Brian Moore Jr. held Utah’s star guard, Terrence Brown, to just 9 points. This broke Brown’s 37-game streak of scoring in double figures.\nUtah’s Offense Stalls Against GCU Pressure\nUtah’s high-powered offense was held 28 points below its season average. The Runnin’ Utes struggled to find any consistent rhythm against GCU’s disciplined scheme.\nTheir 14 turnovers proved costly. Grand Canyon converted those mistakes into 17 points, a key difference in the final score.\nDespite shooting a slightly better percentage from the field, Utah could not overcome its ball-handling errors. The Utes will now play in the tournament’s third-place game.\nChampionship Showdown Against Undefeated Iowa\nThe victory sets up a dramatic final against the Iowa Hawkeyes. Iowa brings a perfect 6-0 record into the championship matchup.\nThe Hawkeyes are a potent offensive team. They lead the nation in field goal percentage, shooting 57.6% from the floor.\nIowa senior guard Bennett Stirtz is a major threat. He scored 29 points in their semifinal win, making six three-pointers. Containing him will be GCU’s primary defensive challenge.\nGame time is set for 7:30 p.m. EST on CBS Sports Network. The Lopes will look to capture a signature non-conference tournament victory.\nGrand Canyon University now has a golden opportunity to claim an early-season tournament championship against a top-tier opponent.\nThought you’d like to know\nWhat was the final score between GCU and Utah?\nGrand Canyon University defeated Utah with a final score of 68-58.
