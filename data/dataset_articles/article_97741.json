  "text": "The Pittsburgh Steelers’ offense on the first drive of the game? Pretty good. The last possession of the half? They’re scoring. To open up the third quarter? Not so much.\nAnd that’s a problem. While the Steelers are improving on long-standing issues like scoring to begin games, they can’t replicate that out of the break. Below is a chart of Pittsburgh’s offensive outcomes in all three scenarios to best compare success and failure.\n| Game | 1st Drive | End Half Drive | Opening 2nd Half Drive |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Jets | TD | TD | Punt |\n| Seahawks | FG | TD | Punt |\n| Patriots | TD | Punt | INT |\n| Vikings | Punt | Blocked FG | Punt |\n| Browns | FG | FG | TD |\n| Bengals | TD | INT | TD |\n| Packers | FG | TD | Punt |\n| Colts | Punt | FG | Punt |\n| Chargers | Punt | INT | Punt |\n| Bengals | TD | FG | FG |\n| Bears | INT | TD | Punt |\nTo summarize, here are the total points scored in all three categories.\n1st Drive: 37\nEnd Half: 37\nOpening 2nd Half: 17\nThat’s seven scoring drives to open up and end the first half. To begin the third quarter? Just three and only once beginning in Week 8.\nIt’s one reason why Pittsburgh has struggled to hold a first-half lead. And crucial chances to “double-dip.” Score late in the first half and again to begin if receiving the ball to begin the third quarter. Moments that truly change the game and vault Pittsburgh ahead before the opposing offense touches the ball again. That hasn’t happened every week, but in several. The Steelers couldn’t do so in Week 1 against the Jets, Week 2 against the Seahawks, Week 8 against the Packers, and Week 12 against the Bears.\nOn Sunday, not only did Pittsburgh allow Chicago to steal three points at the end of the half, but the Steelers’ offense gained all of 1 yard on six plays to begin the third quarter. Pittsburgh punted away, and Chicago drove downfield for a lead they would not relinquish.\nThe team has only double-dipped twice this year: Week 6 against the Browns and Week 11 against the Bengals. But neither was a touchdown-touchdown, and the Bengals’ rematch was just a pair of field goals.\nWhy is Pittsburgh struggling so much? It’s hard to say. But it’s a problem even Arthur Smith has touched on a time or two during his weekly Thursday meetings with the media.\nAn offense isn’t going to score every single time. That’s unreasonable. But self-scouting is essential. Understanding where the team is weak and how things can be improved. Being stronger out of the half is undoubtedly one of those areas.",
