  "text": "Kansas Rallies Past Tennessee in Las Vegas, Shows Grit and Growth in Early-Season Test\nIn a game that felt more like March than November, Kansas showed exactly why you can never count them out - no matter the scoreboard, no matter the opponent. Down 12 early in the second half to a tough, physical Tennessee squad, the Jayhawks dug deep, locked in defensively, and clawed their way to an 81-76 win in the third-place game of the Players Era Tournament at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.\nThis wasnâ€™t just a comeback. It was a gut-check performance that revealed a lot about who this Kansas team is becoming.\nKansas Flips the Script in the Second Half\nTennessee came into this one riding high. The No. 17-ranked Volunteers had knocked off No. 3 Houston and Rutgers to start the tournament, and they looked poised to leave Vegas undefeated after building a 12-point lead with just under 16 minutes to play.\nBut Kansas had other plans.\nThe Jayhawks outscored Tennessee 47-35 in the second half, flipping the game on its head with a combination of gritty defense, timely shot-making, and a refusal to fold when things looked bleak. They held the Vols to just 31.3% shooting after halftime - a stark contrast to Tennesseeâ€™s 51.6% clip in the first 20 minutes.\nFor Kansas head coach Bill Self, the turning point wasnâ€™t just tactical - it was mental.\nâ€œI thought we actually played sound,â€� Self said postgame. â€œWe followed what weâ€™re trying to do.\nThe ball got to the third side quicker. We screened somebody.\nThe shots we gave up were the shots we were supposed to give up.â€�\nThatâ€™s the kind of attention to detail Self demands, and on Wednesday, it finally showed up in a complete way.\nYoung Guns Step Up in the Spotlight\nWith freshman phenom Darryn Peterson still sidelined by a hamstring strain and Jayden Dawson out with a hand injury, Kansas needed someone - anyone - to step up. They got more than that.\nElmarko Jackson put together a career performance with 17 points, playing with confidence and control. Jamari McDowell knocked down two massive threes. And Melvin Council Jr. delivered a complete effort with 17 points, six boards, and four assists - the kind of stat line that doesnâ€™t just fill a box score, it fuels a comeback.\nAnd hereâ€™s the kicker: Kansas outrebounded Tennessee 37-36. Itâ€™s only a one-board margin, but it matters.\nThe Vols are the bigger team, the more physical team on paper. But Kansas brought the fight.\nâ€œThatâ€™s a big deal for us,â€� Self said. â€œI thought we did a great job with the physicality-type plays.â€�\nTennessee Misses Its Moment\nFrom Tennesseeâ€™s perspective, this oneâ€™s going to sting. Rick Barnes knows Kansas all too well from his time at Texas and now Tennessee, and heâ€™s seen enough to understand that a second-half lead against the Jayhawks is never safe.\nâ€œI thought they outcompeted us when it counted,â€� Barnes said. â€œThatâ€™s the hardest thing to take - when theyâ€™re doing things we could have done.â€�\nThe Vols simply didnâ€™t close the door. They stopped doing what got them the lead in the first place - attacking with purpose, defending with discipline, and keeping the ball moving.\nKansas adjusted. Tennessee didnâ€™t.\nThey also couldnâ€™t stay out of foul trouble, which let Kansas get downhill and control tempo late. The Vols shot just 7-of-25 from three and couldnâ€™t find rhythm when it mattered most.\nBig Picture for Kansas\nThis win doesnâ€™t just go in the â€œWâ€� column - it goes in the confidence bank.\nKansas came into this tournament still trying to figure out who they are. They lost to Duke in the Champions Classic, and even in wins over Syracuse and Notre Dame, Self wasnâ€™t thrilled with the mental lapses and sloppy execution.\nBut Wednesday was different.\nâ€œI think we came here doubting how good we could be,â€� Self admitted. â€œToday, I thought we actually played sound.â€�\nThatâ€™s a big statement for a team still missing key pieces. If Kansas can get healthy - with Peterson expected to be re-evaluated Friday and Dawson listed day-to-day - and continue to grow into their identity, theyâ€™ve got the tools to be dangerous.\nAnd now, theyâ€™ve got a signature early-season win to prove it.\nWhatâ€™s Next\nKansas heads back to Allen Fieldhouse for a marquee matchup against UConn on Tuesday night. Whether Peterson or Dawson will be available remains to be seen, but whatâ€™s clear is that this team, even shorthanded, is starting to believe in itself.\nFor Tennessee, this is a learning moment. Theyâ€™ve shown they can beat elite teams, but consistency - especially in closing time - will be the key as they navigate a tough SEC schedule.\nIn Vegas, Kansas didnâ€™t just beat Tennessee. They reminded everyone - including themselves - that theyâ€™re never out of a fight.",
