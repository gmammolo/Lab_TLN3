  "text": "The Detroit Pistons are turning heads across the league - and not just because theyâ€™re winning games. At 15-3, theyâ€™ve stormed out of the gate and claimed the top spot in the Eastern Conference, riding a wave of momentum that includes a 10-game win streak.\nBut the real story? Cade Cunningham.\nThe 24-year-old guard isnâ€™t just playing well - heâ€™s playing like a superstar. And suddenly, the Pistons arenâ€™t a feel-good story.\nTheyâ€™re a problem.\nCunningham is averaging around 27 points, 9 assists, and 5 rebounds per night, and itâ€™s not just the numbers that stand out - itâ€™s the command. He looks like he owns the court every time he steps on it.\nThe game slows down for him, and the Pistons are feeding off that energy. Thereâ€™s a poise and confidence to his game thatâ€™s contagious, and itâ€™s translating into wins.\nNow, the national spotlight is catching up. Kendrick Perkins, never shy with a bold take, declared on NBA on ESPN that Cunningham has made the leap - not just into All-Star territory, but into the leagueâ€™s elite.\nâ€œCade Cunningham is already a Top 10 player in the league,â€� Perkins said. â€œThe ones that are ahead of him? They see him coming right now.â€�\nThatâ€™s not just hype. Thatâ€™s recognition of a player whoâ€™s elevated his game and his team.\nPerkins went even further, drawing comparisons to Luka Doncic and LeBron James - those big, physical playmakers who can score at all three levels and make everyone around them better. Cade, at 6'8\", is doing just that.\nHeâ€™s second in the league in assists behind Nikola Jokic, and heâ€™s doing it while carrying the scoring load.\nAnd Perkins isnâ€™t the only one taking notice. Michael Malone, the former Nuggets coach who knows a thing or two about MVP-caliber talent, called this Cunninghamâ€™s best start to a season yet. â€œHeâ€™s having an MVP-caliber season,â€� said the 2023 NBA champion.\nItâ€™s hard to argue. Cunningham has completely shifted the trajectory of this Pistons team.\nA franchise that was on the outside looking in not long ago is now playing with swagger, structure, and belief. And Cade is at the center of it all - not just as a scorer or facilitator, but as a leader.\nWhat makes this moment even more intriguing is the state of the Eastern Conference. The Celtics and Pacers, both expected to be contenders, have stumbled out of the gate.\nThe Knicks - who knocked Detroit out of the playoffs last year - are adjusting to a new head coach and havenâ€™t found their rhythm yet. The door is open, and the Pistons are charging through it.\nOf course, a hot start doesnâ€™t guarantee anything in the NBA. The season is long, and adversity will come.\nBut what weâ€™re seeing from Detroit isnâ€™t just a team on a heater - itâ€™s a team that looks built to last. Theyâ€™re playing with composure, balance, and a clear identity.\nAnd that identity starts with Cade Cunningham.\nIf he keeps this up, the Pistons arenâ€™t just a fun early-season story. Theyâ€™re a legitimate threat. And if the rest of the league hasnâ€™t taken them seriously yet, they better start soon - because the road to the Finals might just run through Detroit.",
