  "text": "Trent Noah came into this season with a reputation as a sharpshooter, the kind of guy who could stretch defenses and open up the floor for Kentuckyâ€™s high-octane offense. But just nine minutes into his sophomore debut, an ankle injury put those plans on pause. On Wednesday night in Rupp Arena, Noah reminded everyone exactly why there was so much buzz around his name this offseason.\nIn Kentuckyâ€™s 104-54 rout of Tennessee Tech, Noah delivered his best performance yet in a Wildcats uniform. The Harlan native dropped a career-high 16 points in just 21 minutes, shooting a blistering 5-of-6 from the field, including 4-of-5 from beyond the arc, and a perfect 2-for-2 at the line.\nHe also tied his career high with six rebounds and added an assist for good measure. Efficient, confident, and composed - this was the version of Trent Noah fans had been waiting to see.\nAnd he didnâ€™t waste any time making his presence felt. Barely a minute after checking in, Noah drilled his first three-pointer of the night.\nIt was the kind of quick-trigger confidence that Kentucky needs from its perimeter threats. Later in the half, with the Wildcats clinging to a 27-25 lead and struggling to find rhythm, Noah sparked a 16-3 run that blew the game wide open before halftime.\nHis three-pointer during that stretch was a momentum-shifter - not just in the game, but possibly in his season.\nâ€œI was just happy to be out there and playing with my teammates,â€� Noah said postgame. â€œIâ€™m so thankful for them and just having a good time. I mean, itâ€™s Thanksgiving, so Iâ€™m super thankful for all my guys that get me shots and they get me open, and itâ€™s reciprocated.â€�\nThat chemistry is starting to show on the court. Noahâ€™s ability to move without the ball and find pockets of space is giving Kentucky another dimension offensively.\nHis shooting stroke isnâ€™t just smooth - itâ€™s timely. And after going 2-of-4 from deep in last weekâ€™s win over Loyola (MD), heâ€™s now hit 8-of-16 from three on the season.\nThatâ€™s 50% from distance, which, even in a small sample size, is the kind of efficiency that forces defenses to adjust.\nWhat makes this stretch even more impressive is that Noah is doing it while still working his way back from injury. He hasnâ€™t returned to the starting lineup yet, but heâ€™s making a strong case to be a key part of Kentuckyâ€™s rotation moving forward. His shooting is too valuable, especially with a marquee matchup against North Carolina looming.\nFor a Kentucky team with big aspirations, floor spacing and perimeter shooting are non-negotiables. Noahâ€™s emergence couldnâ€™t be better timed.\nThe Wildcats donâ€™t just need scorers - they need specialists who can change the game in spurts. Right now, Trent Noah is stepping into that role with confidence and poise.\nThe ankle may have slowed him down to start the year, but if these last two games are any indication, Noahâ€™s getting back to full speed - and just in time.",
