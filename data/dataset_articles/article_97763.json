  "text": "Thanksgiving in the NBA isnâ€™t just about a break in the schedule or a chance to catch games with family - itâ€™s about connection. And this year, like so many before it, the league leaned into that spirit in a big way. Across the country, players and teams stepped off the hardwood and into their communities, turning the holiday into something much more than just turkey and tip-offs.\nAt the heart of it all is the NBA Cares Season of Giving - an annual initiative that brings players, coaches, and staff face-to-face with the people who fill their arenas and fuel their seasons. From food drives to community dinners, the league-wide effort is a reminder that basketball is bigger than the box score.\nIn Cleveland, Cavaliers guard Darius Garland was one of many players who suited up for something a little different: serving Thanksgiving meals. For Garland, itâ€™s not just a photo op or a one-time gesture. Itâ€™s personal.\nâ€œBeing out there with the community means a lot to me, personally. These are the people who support you, who bring energy into the arena,â€� Garland said. â€œSpending time with them reminds me why I do what I do, and Iâ€™ll always try to use my platform to give back and break barriers in sports, education and life.â€�\nThat mindset is echoed throughout the league. NBA President of Social Responsibility and Player Programs, Kathy Behrens, explained how each team identifies the needs in their own backyard - whether itâ€™s handing out turkeys, organizing holiday shopping sprees, or giving away tickets to kids who might never have stepped inside an NBA arena.\nThe effort officially tipped off on November 11, and since then, the action off the court has been just as impactful as anything happening during game time. From Minneapolis to Miami, teams have been boots-on-the-ground - organizing food drives, hosting community events, and making sure families feel the warmth of the season.\nIn Los Angeles, the Lakers opened their doors to 100 students from After-School All-Stars, giving them a Thanksgiving experience to remember. There was a full feast, carnival games, and some star power to top it off. LeBron James posed for photos, Luka DonÄ�iÄ‡ joined in on the games, and Austin Reaves hit the court with the kids.\nBut LeBronâ€™s reach didnâ€™t stop there. Back in Akron, the LeBron James Family Foundation marked the eighth year of its own Thanksgiving initiative.\nWorking alongside partners, the foundation packed up more than 600 turkeys - complete with all the traditional fixings - and delivered them directly to familiesâ€™ doorsteps. No headlines, no cameras - just impact.\nIn Minnesota, Timberwolves rookie Terrence Shannon Jr. hosted ten families from the Boys & Girls Club of the Twin Cities. Each family received a $500 gift card to shop for groceries at Hy-Vee, turning what could have been a stressful holiday into one filled with abundance and choice.\nAnd the league-wide partnerships continue to grow. The NBA works with national organizations like No Kid Hungry to shine a light on food insecurity and support long-term solutions. Locally, teams team up with groups like the YMCA and Boys & Girls Clubs to make sure the holiday cheer reaches the kids who need it most - not just in the form of meals, but in memories.\nThe scale of these efforts is hard to overstate. According to Behrens, when you add up all the turkey drives, dinners, and giveaways, youâ€™re looking at tens of thousands of meals served. In Philadelphia, Sixers guard Tyrese Maxey held his fourth annual Turkey Giveaway, distributing 3,000 full Thanksgiving dinners in one week alone.\nAnd the giving doesnâ€™t end when the leftovers do. Many teams already have plans in place for December - from toy drives to winter coat giveaways - ensuring that the Season of Giving extends well beyond Thanksgiving.\nIn Detroit, the Pistons were out in full force, distributing meals to families across the city. Itâ€™s just one of many examples of NBA teams using their platform not just to entertain, but to uplift.\nBecause in the NBA, the holiday season isnâ€™t just about what happens on the floor. Itâ€™s about heart, hustle, and showing up for the communities that show up for them - all year long.",
