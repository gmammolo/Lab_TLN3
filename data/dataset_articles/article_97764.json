  "text": "Pat Carbery has had a tumultuous two weeks that could all prove worthwhile on Saturday when he reunites with both his best mates, Bernie Miller and Jokers Grin, in the Group 1 $1.5 million Winterbottom Stakes (1200m) at Ascot.\nThe leading big race jockey was dislodged from a mount a fortnight ago and sustained a concussion, though Carbery can hardly remember it.\n“I fell off approximately 150m after the line and all I can remember is getting to the races and handing in my phone and signing in,” Carbery said.\n“Maybe I was trying to put across that I was A-OK, but I definitely wasn’t A-OK.”\nWith Jokers Grin contesting the Colonel Reeves that weekend, trainer Miller and owners scrambled for a late rider substitute, coming up with fellow veteran hoop Shaun O’Donnell, another of Carbery’s great mates.\n“I didn’t chat to Bernie or anyone about any options. When I was able to contact Bernie, everything was done and dusted,” Carbery said.\n“I was out for the 12 days and I had to complete my cog-stat test, which I passed last Thursday.\n“Just because you pass the cog-stat test doesn’t mean you can come back earlier; you still have to wait the 12 days.\n“It’s probably no different to any other major sports these days - it’s the way things are.\n“Shaun was able to fill in. He didn’t get the keys for very long - I got them back pretty quick - but he did a great job on him and he’s bounced through the run really well.\nCamera Icon\nJokers Grin with Shaun O'Donnell on board.

It was mixed emotions that I wasn’t on him but it was great to see the horse run well, and did what we expected him to do.\n“It’s not the spot that I want to be in too many times, that’s for sure.”\nHowever, that hasn’t stemmed the jockey’s involvement with Jokers Grin, or Lukey as he’s affectionately known, with Carbery keeping a close eye on his preparation.\n“I haven’t been aboard Jokers Grin - I’ve watched him work,” he said.\n“I’ve been at the track when he’s worked. When I walked through the gate and called his name, he looked up.\n“I don’t think whether he thought, ‘oh this clown again’ or what, but I watched him work on Thursday and watched him gallop on Saturday.\n“Shaun stepped up a couple of times to work him and Megan always works him at home, so he’s going well.\n“I’ve ridden my daughter’s pony a few times - I’m allowed to do that - but not a racehorse.\n“I’ve been riding the mechanical horse and keeping busy around home.\n“The pony doesn’t give me the same feel as Lukey unfortunately, but I’ve been keeping busy and keeping active. “\nCamera Icon\nPatrick Carbery with Bernie Miller. Credit: Simon Merritt / Simon Merritt / Western Racepix Carbery’s connection with Jokers Grin has always run deeper than race day rider; it’s generational.\n“From the start, I rode his mum.\n“Obviously, he’s fast, but we’ve always had that connection from the start.\n“I rode him when he was still at the (horse) breakers and Kane Land said to Bernie, ‘I want Patty to ride this horse.’\n“Bernie said, ‘oh why, is he naughty and you need to see what he does wrong?’ Kane said, ‘no, I reckon this horse is real good and I want to know what he thinks and whether I’m on the money or not.’\n“So, we went two laps and I trotted down to the 800m, and when we were trotting, I was thinking, ‘wow.’\n“Good horses will give you that feel all day long - they don’t have to go fast, you just know.\n“I cantered off on him and I looked across at Kane and didn’t say anything. He said, ‘I was right, wasn’t I?’\n“It took a long time to get him to the races for a few different reasons but for him to show what he did at that early stage (was unreal).”\nIt wasn’t always smooth sailing, though.\nThe only time the five-year-old has missed a place was his debut, when he raced fiercely and his attitude got the better of him.\n“Both myself and Bernie were really disappointed we got it wrong that day,” Carbery said.\n“We thought he would just run in a 1200m (race) and settle OK and be fine.\n“He certainly didn’t. It was a slow tempo but he over-travelled and pulled really hard.\n“He was caught wide and ended up going to the front. We were disappointed that he didn’t win and ran fourth, but more so that we got it wrong.\n“I came in and said to the owners, ‘we need to nip this in the bud straight away or we’re going to have a horse that’s just going to be a mad speedy horse and not going to win many races.’\n“I said, ‘we need to go back to 1000m and teach him to relax.’\n“From that day, we just continually tried to work to get him to relax, and this is the end result.\n“This is what we’ve been working towards. Credit to the owners for letting us do what we thought was right and being so patient.\n“They’re reaping the rewards right now.”\nThis preparation, the son of Maschino has been faultless.\nTwo come-from-behind successes in the Prince Of Wales (1000m) and Colonel Reeves Stakes (1100m) have shown the trademarks of a far more professional conveyance.\n“He’s definitely a lot more mature than he was,” Carbery said.\n“Each run he has, he bounces out of his runs better than what he used to.\n“He’s always bounced out of them well but Bernie is particularly surprised how well he bounces out of his runs this preparation.\n“Being a bit stronger and a bit more mature stands him in good stead.\n“He’s in a good spot and Bernie’s particularly happy with him.”\nFor only the second time in his 12-start career, Jokers Grin will start from a mid-division or better barrier (five), with Carbery admitting he was expecting to draw wide again.\nHe’s the $2.60 favourite, just ahead of chief danger Overpass ($2.70), though Carbery is not getting caught up in beating one rival.\nCamera Icon\nOverpass with Jenny Wright at Naval Base Horse Beach. Credit: Simon Merritt / Simon Merritt / Western Racepix “He’s not the only horse in the race,” he said.\n“Overpass comes here in good order. I watched him work this morning, he always runs well here and he seems to just thrive when he comes to Perth. He looks a million dollars.\n“But the other horses that have come from over east, they’re no slouches either.\n“I think Rey Magnerio ($9) is going to be one to chase down and you can’t fault Dion’s horse (Oscar’s Fortune, $18) either.\n“But they’re all in it and they’re all being prepared to win it. It’s good to be a part of it.”\nOn Friday night, Carbery will eat his fish dinner and tuck into bed at 8pm at the latest before going to trackwork the following morning.\nIn the late stages of his career, he is a cool customer. However, Miller, a man who he considers his brother, will be up pacing.\n“Bernie is not as chilled as me. He definitely doesn’t sleep as well as me,” Carbery said.\n“I asked him this morning, ‘how’d you sleep?’ He said, ‘oh mate, you know the story’.\n“I don’t know how he does it. He’ll probably take three or four to the track (on Saturday) anyway.\n“I said, ‘why don’t you just stay home?’ He says, ‘I won’t be able to sleep anyway, so I might as well get out of bed’.”",
