  "text": "The Fresno State men's basketball team faced an eight-point deficit, but left their Acrisure Series game in Palm Desert with a 23-point win. The 'Dogs defeated Pepperdine 76-53 after a dominant second half performance.\nThe Bulldogs trailed 35-27 at halftime before opening the second half with an astonishing 45-6 run. Fresno State led by as many as 32 points before the Pepperdine Waves closed the game with a 11-2 run.\nThe victory lifts Fresno State to a 6-2 record - as many wins as the Bulldogs had in all of last season in head coach Vance Walberg's first 6-26 season. On this night, he led his current team against his old one - Walberg coached Pepperdine from 2006 to 2008.\nIt was a 3-point shooting drought that had the Bulldogs trailing at halftime, and a 3-point shooting deluge that fueled the 'Dogs past the Waves. Fresno State was 1-of-14 from 3-point range in the first half. Javon Cooley made Pepperdine's fifth 3-pointer of the opening half, followed by a jumper, to lift the Waves to a 35-27 halftime advantage.\nThe Bulldogs went from 1-of-14 in the first half to 8-of-16 in the second half. DeShawn Gory kicked off the action with a 3-pointer to open the half. Cameron Faas followed with another, then a second. The 'Dogs also continued on in the second half with 10 consecutive field goal makes, including another 3-pointer from Faas and one from Heidbreder.\n.\n— CBS Sports College Basketball 🏀 (@CBSSportsCBB)[@FresnoStateMBB]drains the three to take the lead 💦[pic.twitter.com/Neg4InntrW][November 27, 2025]\nAfter the first Bulldog miss in six-plus minutes of basketball, Heidbreder quickly sank back-to-back 3-pointers. He then added a layup and Gory threw down an alley-oop dunk.\nSome stuffing off the lob!\n— CBS Sports College Basketball 🏀 (@CBSSportsCBB)[@FresnoStateMBB]continues to pour in the points vs. Pepperdine 🔥🔥[pic.twitter.com/vS0ARIqjh1][November 27, 2025]\nThe action included a 19-0 run after halftime, turning the 35-27 deficit into a 46-35 lead. And after Heidbreder's run of 3-pointers went in, the Bulldogs' lead swelled to 60-37 with 11:54 still to play. Heidbreder sank a fourth 3-pointer to cap what became a 45-6 run in a stretch of 15 minutes of basketball.\nHeidbreder scored on a layup with 5:44 to go for a 74-42 lead and a 47-7 run. Fresno State would only make one more basket the rest of the way as they coasted to a 76-53 win.\ncall him butter the way he's on a roll 🧈\n— Fresno State Men’s Basketball (@FresnoStateMBB)[@jake_heidbreder][pic.twitter.com/qX4Ej5hUGZ][November 27, 2025]\nHeidbreder finished with a team-high 27 points, 20 of which came in the second half. Last Friday he had scored a career-high 33 points in a win over New Orleans. The freshman Gory added 11 points with 7 rebounds. Faas had 9 points on 3-of-5 from 3-point range. The Bulldogs finished 9-of-30 from 3-point range with Heidbreder (4) and Faas (3) making 7 of them.\nZaon Collins was the only other Bulldog in double figures with 10 points and 9 assists. Wilson Jacques added 6 points and 6 rebounds.\nWalberg shrunk the Bulldogs' rotation down to primarily eight players, the smallest yet this season. But all 14 'Dogs in uniform saw action by the final buzzer.\nFresno State improves to 6-2 while Pepperdine falls to 3-4.\nUp next is a special home game for the Bulldogs. Fresno State will not be at the Save Mart Center, but instead will return to Selland Arena. The 'Dogs will host Cal State Bakersfield on Sunday, Nov. 30, at 3 p.m. PT in the Downtown Fresno venue. The Roadrunners are 3-4 on the season.",
