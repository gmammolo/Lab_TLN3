  "text": "Utah women's basketball snapped their three-game skid on Wednesday night as they took down Weber State, 65-52. This was a much-needed bounce-back game for the Utes as they inch closer to the start of conference play. This win was a nice bounce back for the team that is trying to get their feet under them with a plethora of new players.\n\"We didn't really talk about going, 0-3, in the last three games. Obviously, we all knew that. I think they were a great test for us of playing teams of like, that's where we want to be. We're new, we're young. There are a lot of things we have to fix, but I think every game in the preseason is 'we want to get better'. Gavin always says we don't want to be at our max potential right now. We want to get that in the postseason,\" Maty Wilke said post-game. \"So I think it was, obviously, it's hard. I don't know the last time we've done that as a program, but adversity like that's when you come together, and that's where you grow. And I feel like today was a great step in some aspects that we can take and keep moving forward.\"\nTrue freshman Avery Hjelmstad earned her first career start in the place of Reese Ross and led the team in points in the win.\n\"I think part of the growing process and kind of learning is also knowing that your teammates and your coaching staff believe in you, and we tell her that. So now it was time to, like, Okay, put your money where your mouth is. And so, yeah, I think it was a no-brainer,\" head coach Gavin Petersen said about the decision to start the Oklahoma native tonight.\nHjelmstad hadn't scored for the first three quarters of tonight's match, but then rattled off 12 points, including eight straight to open the quarter.\n\"I think I need to start with the mentality in that first quarter, in the first half that I am a capable scorer, and not wait until the fourth quarter to let it fly,\" Hjelmstad said post-game.\n\"We obviously need her to be able to do that. Just starting the game, I could tell she was in her head, and I mean, you could just tell the weight kind of shifted off, lifted off her shoulders a little bit. So I'm really, I'm really happy for her,\" Wilke said. \"Obviously, there are adjustments that every freshman has, but she's so good. She is one of the best shooters I've ever played with. So I'm very proud of her to have this game today and hopefully just keep building her confidence up before conference starts.\"\nFour other Utes had nine points, including Maty Wilke, who led the team in rebounds with seven. Wilke also led the team in assists with five and steals with three.\nUtah cleaned up on the turnovers in the win, giving the ball up just 11 times compared to the 24 times they did on Sunday.\nWilke says the team wanted ot work on limiting the turnovers after last week, and this is just step one in a long list of things that need to be cleaned up before conference play.\nBut there is one big thing that Petersen wants his group to work on before the team faces off with Montana on Saturday.\n\"Rebounding,\" he said without hesitating. \"We have great shooters, so we make a lot of shots, but the tendency is, we assume they're always going in. And scouting reports are out, they're going to try to get us off the three-point line, and we're gonna have to make our second and third reads. And so what we want to do is try to create second chances for us. And we've kind of gotten away from that.\"\nPetersen did add that at this time of year, there isn't much time to practice in between games, but it is something that they are going to commit to improving upon.\nNot a subscriber?
