  "text": "Sport\nUCL: Theirry Henry names most solid team in Europe\nCBS Sports pundit, Thierry Henry has named Arsenal as the most solid team in Europe.\nThe Frenchman spoke after Arsenal defeated Bayern Munich 3-1 in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday.\nRecall that three goals from Jurrien Timber, Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli ensured the Premier League leaders defeated Vincent Kompany’s side at the Emirates Stadium.\nSpeaking after the final whistle at the Emirates Stadium, Henry said: “They [Bayern Munich] play, Arsenal, but they don’t overplay when they are in their own half.\n“They tend to go long when they know that mistakes can happen and it worked out.\n“They scored on the counter-attack and they actually scored on Bayern trying to overplay.\n“I thought it was a good game from Arsenal: solid, especially after the weekend and with what is coming also this weekend.\n“I would like to say they are the most solid team in Europe at the moment.”",
