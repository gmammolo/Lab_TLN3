  "text": "Fourth quarter propels SR to win\nSR Basketball\nA back-and-forth affair highlighted girls basketball action on Saturday night in Versailles and in the end it was South Ripley using a 19-point fourth quarter to slide past Batesville 59-52 in a rematch of last year’s Ripley County Tournament Championship.\nThe Lady Raiders have now won five games in a row while the victory on Saturday also snapped Batesville’s three-game win streak.\nEach team had their chance to take jabs and the scoreboard was evident of that as the lead changed hands on more than one occasion. Batesville led at the first two stops of the game but a 12-10 edge to open the second half allowed South Ripley to slip ahead 40-39 going into the final stanza. The Lady Raiders continued to build momentum in the final eight minutes, going on a 19-13 run that lifted them to a seven-point win.\nSouth Ripley got a huge second half out of Kaiya Rinear who scored 15 of her 22 total points in the final two quarters. That included 10 points in the fourth quarter. Claire Samples added 11 points with nine of them coming in the first half.\nAubrey Werner and Illana Prosser added eight points and seven points respectively for the green and white.\nBatesville put three players in double figures. Kaylin Kathmann dropped 17 points with 12 points coming on four 3-pointers. Nora Wiedeman added 11 points and Maggie Jelinek went for 10 points.\nBoth South Ripley and Batesville were Friday night winners a week ago. The Lady Raiders never allowed Lawrenceburg to score in double-digits in any quarter and drilled the Lady Tigers by a 49-30 final score.\nSamples put together a stat line of 19 points, six rebounds, four steals and three assists and Werner scored 12 points. Rinear added nine points and eight rebounds while other scoring for the Lady Raiders were Prosser with five points, Evelyn Kelly at two points and both Emily Parks and Sophie Lauber with one point.\nBatesville went on the road Friday and won 35-31 at Seymour. Statistics from the game were not provided by time of print.\nBatesville (3-2) heads to Jac-Cen-Del this Friday night for a county rivalry game while South Ripley (5-1) is home on Saturday afternoon against Class 4A No. 11 East Central.\nSATURDAY’S GIRLS BASKETBALL GAME\nat South Ripley\nSOUTH RIPLEY 59, BATESVILLE 52\nBV – 18. 11. 10. 13. – 52\nSR – 14. 14. 12. 19. – 59\nBATESVILLE (3-2) – Kaylin Kathmann 17, Nora Wiedeman 11, Maggie Jelinek 10, Molly Gesell 5, Jersey Trenkamp 5, Leah Meyer 4, Caitlin Raver 0, Jolene Dirkhising 0.\nSOUTH RIPLEY (5-1) – Kaiya Rinear 22, Claire Samples 11, Aubrey Werner 8, Illana Prosser 7, Emily Parks 5, Evelyn Kelly 4, Sophie Lauber 2.\n3-Point Goals – BV 8 (Kathmann 4, Wiedeman 3, Trenkamp 1), SR 7 (Rinear 3, Werner 2, Samples 1, Parks 1).
