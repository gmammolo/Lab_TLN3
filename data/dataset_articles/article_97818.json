  "text": "While the Dallas Mavericks have fired general manager Nico Harrison, it hasn’t taken away from how bad this season has gone so far for the franchise.\nThe Dallas Mavericks have gotten out to a poor 5-14 start, while Luka Doncic is dominating with the Los Angeles Lakers.\nThe team has also had injuries to their top stars in Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis, while other veteran players like Klay Thompson and D’Angelo Russell have struggled.\nThe only bright spot has been rookie Cooper Flagg, who is showing why he’s the future of this team. There is another player who is giving the Mavericks’ fanbase something to get excited about.\nThe Mavericks signed guard Brandon Williams to a two-year contract before the season started.\nThe 26-year-old played for the Mavericks over the last two seasons on two separate two-way contracts.\nWilliams has been getting more minutes this season and he has shown a lot of positive signs.\nWilliams has started in 9 of his 17 games with the Mavericks this season, averaging 10.9 points, 3.9 assists, 2.7 rebounds, and 1.5 steals in 21.9 minutes per game.\nDespite his shooting numbers being down—hitting just 38.9 percent of his shots and 19.2 percent of his threes—Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd still had some good things to say about Williams.\n“You look at B Will’s ability to work on his game and understand he’s playing at a high level for us and starting, and so given the opportunity in this league, he’s taking full advantage of it.”\nWilliams has been able to get in some valuable reps this season with Irving out.\nLeBron James and Kyrie Irving were unstoppable on the Cleveland Cavaliers!\nHe has stepped in as the team’s starting point guard and has had some good moments, all while learning from Irving.\nWilliams revealed what he has learned from Irving during his extended role.\n“I think just being able to know different scoring, different moves that leads to scoring, and then also just being the floor general out there, finding guys, attacking the paint, and being able not just to score, but find his teammates.”\nWith Irving not expected to be back until January at the earliest, Williams should continue to get plenty of opportunities moving forward.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
