  "text": "Bhubaneswar: In a bid to strengthen disaster management capabilities, the state govt has approved the establishment of 10 new Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) units, raising the total strength to 30 units across the state.Previously, 16 districts had the presence of 20 units. Though the new units will come up in 10 districts, comprising Gajapati, Malkangiri, Kalahandi, Bhadrak, Kendrapada, Puri, Ganjam (Berhampur), Cuttack (rural), Keonjhar and Sambalpur, two of them (Ganjam and Cuttack) already had two and one units, respectively. With this expansion, ODRAF's presence now extends to 24 districts.According to a notification issued by the state home department on July 7, the govt has created 1,035 new posts to staff 23 units, including the 10 new ones.\\\"This expansion represents govt's focus on building a more resilient Odisha. With these additional units, we can respond more swiftly and effectively to both natural and man-made disasters,\\\" a senior police official said.ODRAF was set up in 2001, which came in response to the devastating 1999 Super Cyclone that claimed over 10,000 lives in the state. Each ODRAF unit comprises about 45 highly trained police personnel drawn from various forces, including from Odisha special armed police, armed police reserve, India reserved battalion and specialized India reserve battalions.\\\"Our disaster management mechanism is one of the best in the country. ODRAF along with the Odisha fire and emergency service have been playing key roles. Their military-style training enables them to handle diverse emergency situations effectively,\\\" the official said.According to govt, the ODRAF personnel have undergone specialized training in rescue operations, first aid and disaster response. \\\"Their expertise has proven invaluable during several calamities, from floods to cyclones. Our goal is to minimize response time during emergencies. These additional units will significantly enhance our disaster preparedness and emergency response capabilities across the state,\\\" the police official added.ODRAF, used as a pre- and post-disaster response force, works in coordination with the office of the special relief commissioner to respond to crisis situations.",
