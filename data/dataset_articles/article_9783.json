  "text": "Methodist Healthcare Ministries Commits $3 Million to Central Texas Flood Relief Efforts\nLisa Valadez |\n7/10/2025, 1:26 p.m.\nIn the wake of catastrophic flooding that struck Central Texas over the past weekend, Methodist Healthcare Ministries (MHM) has committed $3 million to support relief and recovery efforts across affected communities.\nThe flooding, triggered by days of intense rainfall, inundated homes, damaged infrastructure, and displaced hundreds of residents throughout the Texas Hill Country and surrounding areas. Emergency crews and local organizations have been working around the clock to provide shelter, supplies, and medical assistance to those in need.\nMHM's $3 million pledge aims to bolster these efforts by providing both immediate relief and long-term recovery support. Of the total commitment, $1.15 million has already been allocated to eight nonprofit and community-based organizations working on the ground. These funds will assist with emergency housing, shelter operations, mental health services, grief counseling, and other urgent needs.\nInitial Fund Allocations:\n- Light on the Hill at Mount Wesley: $300,000\n- LiftFund: $500,000\n- Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country: $100,000\n- United Way of San Antonio: $50,000\n- Rio Texas Conference of the United Methodist Church: $50,000\n- Concho Valley Regional Food Bank: $50,000\n- McCulloch County Resource Center: $50,000\n- New Hope Counseling Center: $50,000\nMethodist Healthcare Ministries has a longstanding presence in the region through its network of Wesley Nurses and community health workers. As recovery efforts evolve, MHM plans to expand its regional footprint by deploying additional funding, partnerships, and resources tailored to long-term community support and resilience.\nThe remaining $1.85 million of MHM’s commitment will be distributed in phases as more needs are identified by local partners and residents impacted by the disaster.\nThis initiative continues MHM’s tradition of supporting vulnerable populations across South and Central Texas, particularly in times of crisis. As communities begin the difficult process of rebuilding, MHM’s ongoing involvement is expected to provide both practical assistance and a foundation for long-term recovery.",
