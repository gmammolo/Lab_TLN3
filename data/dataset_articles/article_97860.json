  "text": "News\nDAVID GONZALEZ TAKES DOWN COMMERCE WSOP CIRCUIT MAIN EVENT\nLas Vegas, Nevada (November 26, 2025) - After three Day One flights and five days of exciting action on the felt, Commerce Casino in Southern California has a new WSOP Circuit Main Event champion.\nBattling back despite having the shortest stack late in Day 2, David Gonzalez overcame the odds to win the Commerce WSOP Circuit Main Event, receiving the $213,524 top prize and his first WSOP Circuit ring.\nBattling with Luis Yepez heads-up at the final table, Gonzalez and Yepez’s battle at the poker table long preceded the finale of the Commerce WSOP Circuit Main Event, as both players were placed at the same table during their Day One Flight.\nTurning a better flush to complete his victory against Yepez, Gonzalez’s mind went straight to his biggest supporter when speaking with Poker.org’s Eric Lusch during his winner’s interview.\n“I’d love to thank my wife, she has spent countless nights alone, while I’m playing until one in the morning. She’s the best partner anybody can have, none of this would be possible without her. I don’t know hardly any wives that would allow their husband to work a full-time job and play as much as she loves me to play.
