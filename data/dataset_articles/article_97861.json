  "text": "Jaipur, Nov 27 : The second encounter of the Kota Cup, yet again, ended in a stylish victory for the Jaipur Polo team as they came out victorious by a scoreline of 10-6 against Chunda Polo to qualify for the final of the tournament.\nThe game saw impressive contributions from players across both teams, but Jaipurâ€™s consistent scoring helped them secure the win. For the home team, it was again the attacking duo of Maharaja Sawai Padmanabh Singh of Jaipur and Lance Watson who bagged all the goals.\nPadmanabh Singh did the bulk of the scoring with six goals to his name and Watson scored the rest to complete a stellar performance.\nThe match began with both teams showing their intensity, and it was none other than Padmanabh Singh of Jaipur who scored the opening goal to secure an early lead. Jaipur continued the momentum as they added two more goals quickly led by Lance Watson to end the chukker at 3-1.\nThe second chukker saw Chunda Polo trying to make a comeback as they scored two but the team Jaipur was relentless as they kept piling up the score with two more goals from Padmanabh Singh to end the second chukker with a lead of 5-3.\nThe third chukker was all about Jaipur as Padmanabh Singh added three more goals to his name and Lance Watson added one. Chunda Polo could get back one goal but it was too late already as the score stood at 9-4 in Jaipur's favour at the end of the chukker.\nThe last chukker was more about being prudent rather than going for attacks. While Chunda Polo scored two goals, Jaipur scored the final and the 10th goal via Lance Watson to cap off a commanding win.\nThe final of the tournament will now be played on November 30 at the Rajasthan Polo Club, wherein Jaipur still awaits the challenger.\n--IANS\nbc/ab",
