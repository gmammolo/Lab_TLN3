  "text": "The University of Missouri System Board of Curators approved a contract extension for coach Eli Drinkwitz on Wednesday, according to KSDK’s Frank Cusumano.\nThe proposed extension would be for six years and, perhaps, additional years if Drinkwitz meets certain incentives. Nothing has been signed yet, but reports indicate that there’s optimism of an agreement coming soon.\nIn February, Drinkwitz signed an extension through the 2029 season while also securing an increased salary pool for his staff. If the latest contract is signed by both parties, Drinkwitz’s staff would be among the highest-paid in the Southeastern Conference.\nDrinkwitz had been rumored to be a candidate for job openings at Florida, LSU, Auburn and Penn State in recent weeks. Should Drinkwitz agree to an extension, it would keep him in Columbia until well after construction is complete at Memorial Stadium.\nThe Board of Curators held a special meeting Wednesday. The public meeting over Zoom lasted less than 90 seconds before the group moved into executive session, which is closed to the public.\nPrevious reports indicated that the curators would be discussing a contract extension for Drinkwitz.\nThe 42-year-old is in his sixth season at Mizzou. Assuming he finishes the 2026 season as MU’s coach, he’ll be tied with Al Onofrio, Larry Smith and Warren Powers as the fifth-longest tenured coach in program history.\nThe Tigers are 7-4 entering their regular-season finale against Arkansas, which is slated to kick off at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday.\nLet the news come to you\nGet any of our free email newsletters — news headlines, e-edition, prep sports, obituaries, entertainment and more.\nExplore newsletters",
