  "text": "By Jeremy Lagos ,\n19 hours ago\nSt. Michael-Albertville gymnastics enters the new season following a strong showing last winter. The Knights represented Section 5AA at the 2025 Class AA State Gymnastics Championships, placing eighth at Roy Wilkins Auditorium in St. Paul this past February.\nSenior Amarah Petersen and senior captain Avery LeMonds return from that state tournament team and also qualified themselves individually.\n“The sport is super competitive, and we’re always excited to be in the same venue as the other teams that are just so deserving. It’s a super fun experience for the kids and me,” head coach Heather Dietrich Feigum said.\nDietrich Feigum has coached since 1994 and has been with STMA for 26 years. “It’s a good community. There are super cool people here,” she said.\nEvery team talks about culture and chemistry, but this Knights group has it. LeMonds and junior captain Grace Lindenfelser are intentional about reaching out to their teammates, building up younger gymnasts and creating excitement as the season begins.\n“I’m looking forward to competing with my team. We have a lot of new girls this year and are just accomplishing our goals and working together this season,” LeMonds said.\nAs captains, LeMonds and Lindenfelser focus on putting their teammates’ needs first and leading by example.\nThis year’s roster includes eight newcomers joining five returners from last season. Three of the rookies are expected to compete for spots in the varsity rotation.\n“Every year, we come in with high expectations. Every kid will start wherever they are and level up from there,” Dietrich Feigum said. “That’s the baseline expectation, and we happen to be in a position where these kids are real strong.”\nThe Knights spent the offseason training hard and arrived with improved skills and strength. With a short preseason before a demanding schedule, the team has hit the ground running.\n“I’m excited to see all the offseason work pay off,” Lindenfelser said. “We’ve all been working really hard in the gym, and I’m excited to see what we can do when we put it all together.”\nSTMA’s upperclassmen have made multiple state tournament appearances, and barring injuries or unexpected setbacks, the Knights expect to be contenders in both the section and state races again.\nEven with the sport’s intense competitiveness, gymnastics remains a community that supports one another.\n“It’s about building kids up and providing great opportunities for everybody. There is no gatekeeping or ill will,” Dietrich Feigum said. “We’re fostering a positive culture, like we have in years past, which will help them in the gym and in life in general.”\nSTMA has won several section championships but continues to chase its first state team title.\n“To get back to state, we have to focus on the goals that we have and really drive to meet them and make a really positive atmosphere,” LeMonds said.\n“I think it’s important that at this point in the process, we really look at the little things,” Lindenfelser added. “We’ve all put in the hard work, and we have the skills. It’s about cleaning it up and making sure everything looks good.”\nWith a blend of seasoned leaders, promising newcomers and a culture centered on support and steady improvement, the Knights are positioned for another strong run. As they refine the details and build on last year’s momentum, STMA enters the season confident, motivated and focused on returning to state — and pushing closer to the program’s first championship.\nMeet the Knights\n*= captain\nSenior Shelby Fischer\n*Senior Avery LeMonds\nSenior Amarah Peterson\nSenior Skye Yaeger\nJunior Zoey Day\n*Junior Grace Lindenfelser\nJunior Alivia Schut\nSophomore Cassudy Dahmen\nSophomore Alivia Kuechle\nSophomore Evelyn Neilson\nSophomore Lilyana Turner\nSophomore Maddie Weiss\nFreshman Heidi Flemming\nFreshman Colbie Johnson\nFreshman Lucy Kobus\nFreshman Claire Martin\nFreshman Lexy Mau\nFreshman Evelynn McLean\nFreshman Mia Thering\nEighth-grader Viviana Bellio\nEighth-grader Elizabeth Ge\nEighth-grader Allie Severson\nEighth-grader Reagan Zastrow\nSeventh-grader Sariyah Shannon-Davis\nSeventh-grader Emelia Swanson",
