  "text": "Sport\nUCL: What Theirry Henry told Declan Rice after Arsenal’s 3-1 win over Bayern Munich\nArsenal legend, Thierry Henry has expressed his confidence to midfielder Declan Rice that the Gunners can win a major trophy this season.\nHenry spoke after Arsenal defeated Bayern Munich 3-1 in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday.\nRecall that three goals from Jurrien Timber, Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli gave Mikel Arteta’s side the win over the Bavarians at the Emirates Stadium.\n“I will be honest with you [Declan Rice] there is something different this year,” Henry said to Rice via CBS Sports.\n“Before, I used to say that Arsenal can win because I am a fan. Now I say it without my Arsenal hat on.\n“The way Arsenal look as a team, as a unit, is different. There is something that is happening.”\nArsenal failed to win any major trophy last season as they were eliminated from the Champions League in the knock out stage and also finished in second position on the Premier League table behind Liverpool.",
