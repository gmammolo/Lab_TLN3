  "text": "‘I couldn’t be happier’ – New Ireland coach Michael Bree upbeat as EuroBasket campaign begins\nMichael Bree’s reign as Ireland head coach kicks off with an away clash against Luxembourg tonight, the first step in their EuroBasket 2029 qualifying campaign.\nThe Sligo man signed a four-year contract after serving as an assistant coach to Denmark, while he also continues as programme director for RIG Mark basketball academy in Sweden.\nThe former Ireland international earned 40 caps for his country from 2000 to 2006, playing alongside the first Irish-born NBA player Pat Burke and Jay Larranaga.\nHe returned to the national set-up in upbeat form on Monday, taking a first training session in Tallaght after travelling from his home in Kinna, Sweden.\n“I couldn’t be happier,” the 45-year-old said. “I’ve been part of every youth Ireland set-up all the way through, playing and even coaching some national teams.\n“I’m super proud, super happy and I’m delighted to be back. I’m born and raised here. It’s my country.”\nBree aims to “build slowly” during his tenure, which begins against Luxembourg (6.30pm) tonight before Sunday’s second pre-qualifier against North Macedonia in Dublin’s National Basketball Arena (5.0pm).\nWhile the new coach’s long-term goal may be a gradual one, captain Seán Flood knows that does not mean any easing off the pedal this week.\n“To meet Mike’s expectations, 2-0 is definitely the goal for the week,” Flood said.\nThe 29-year-old has been retained as skipper despite still searching for a club six months after last lining out competitively with Tartu in the Estonian finals. He does not fear being out of practice.\n“No, that’s something I’ve not given much thought to. I’d rather trust the work that I’ve put in,” the Dubliner said.\n“Obviously, I’ve a bit of a unique situation. It’s my first game after the Estonian finals, probably six months ago. The 31st of May was probably my last competitive game that really meant something.\n“So, yeah, it’s a different sense of energy [this week]. I’m excited, having not been part of a group for the last little while. Coming in, it’s rejuvenating.”\nFlood was part of the side that beat Luxembourg twice two years ago in the campaign to reach the 2025 tournament.\nAnother point guard, CJ Fulton was part of that side, but he is unavailable this time since joining Iowa Wolves in the NBA’s G League.\nShooting guard Taiwo Badmus returns to the Ireland squad following injury, while centre Max Amadasun and New York-born forward Max Zona are in line for international debuts.\nSam Alajiki’s Israeli club Hapoel Galil Elion may raise eyebrows, given the controversy over Ireland women’s recent clash with Israel.\nOn the court however, Ireland will hope to beat Luxembourg again as they aim to progress by finishing first in Group A or as the best second-placed team.\n“We are aware of the urgency of a first fixture in a group stage on the road,” Flood added. “We feel if we play our best basketball and they play their best basketball, we will come out on top.”\nLuxembourg v Ireland,\nTG4 Player, 6.30",
