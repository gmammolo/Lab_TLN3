  "text": "Tulsa Wins Acrisure Holiday Invitational Behind Defense And Clutch Free Throws\nTulsa snapped a 22-year in-season tournament drought Wednesday night, grinding out a 63-60 win over previously unbeaten Northern Iowa to claim the Acrisure Holiday Invitational title at Acrisure Arena.\nThe victory marks TU’s first in-season tournament championship since 2002 and pushes the Golden Hurricane to 6-1, their best start since the 2019-20 season.\nwinner, winner, chicken dinner\n— Tulsa Basketball (@TUMBasketball)\n🏆🏆🏆[#ReignCane][pic.twitter.com/Q0eXfHrypn][November 27, 2025]\nBalanced Scoring, Big Moments\nJaylen Lawal led the early surge and finished with 12 points on 4-of-7 shooting, knocking down two 3-pointers and both of his free throws.\nTylen Riley paced Tulsa with 13 points, going a perfect 6-for-6 from the line while adding three assists and steady guard play down the stretch.\nTournament MVP Miles Barnstable added 11 points, drilling three 3-pointers and blocking two shots, including the dagger 3 with 1:22 remaining to help seal the win.\nMyles Rigsby chipped in 10 points, went 4-for-4 at the stripe, and contributed two steals and three assists.\nAs a team, Tulsa went 14-of-15 from the free-throw line and limited UNI to just 10 attempts, winning the foul line battle in a one-possession game.\nFirst-Half Push Sets The Tone\nIn a back-and-forth first half that featured five ties, Tulsa finally created separation late.\nRigsby’s early free throws kept TU steady before Lawal caught fire, hitting back-to-back 3-pointers and a layup to flip momentum.David Green buried a 3-pointer with 3:28 left in the half to cap a 34-27 Golden Hurricane advantage at the break, despite a late UNI fast-break dunk from Leon Bond III.\nClosing Time In A Defensive Battle\nTulsa never fully shook the Panthers, but they never surrendered the lead in the second half, either.\nRiley knocked down two free throws just 34 seconds into the half and later added a fast-break layup to keep TU in front. UNI big man Will Hornseth powered multiple late possessions to keep the Panthers within striking distance, including a key layup at the 4:56 mark.\nUNI’s Kyle Pock buried a 3 with 1:37 remaining to trim the lead to three, but Barnstable answered with a huge 3-pointer on the next trip, giving Tulsa just enough cushion to close out a 63-60 win.\nTulsa was held under 80 points for the first time this season, snapping a six-game streak of scoring 80-plus the program’s longest such run since 2001-02, but the defensive effort and free-throw shooting carried the night.\nWhat’s Next\nThe Golden Hurricane return home to the Reynolds Center to host Manhattan Christian on December 2, looking to build on their 6-1 start and newly earned tournament hardware.",
