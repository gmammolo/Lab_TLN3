  "text": "[OSEN=Gil Joon-young reporter] Pro baseball Doosan Bears’ Lee Young-ha, 28 years old, has secured a large contract exceeding 5 billion Korean won, drawing attention to the whereabouts of left-handed relief pitcher FA top free agent Kim Beom-su, 30 years old.Doosan announced on the 27th, “We have signed a 4-year maximum 5.2 billion Korean won contract (signing bonus 2.3 billion Korean won, total annual salary 2.3 billion Korean won, incentives 0.6 billion Korean won) with free agent (FA) pitcher Lee Young-ha.”Lee Young-ha, who joined Doosan as the first pick in the 2016 rookie draft, is a right-handed pitcher with a KBO League career record of 355 games (802⅓ innings) pitched, 60 wins, 46 losses, 27 holds, 9 saves, and a 4.71 ERA. In the early stages of his career, he played as a starting pitcher and in 2019, he recorded 17 wins, 4 losses, and a 3.64 ERA in 29 games (163⅓ innings) pitched, finishing second in the league in wins.Starting in 2020, Lee began moving between starting and relief roles, and from 2023, his position was fully changed to a relief pitcher. This year, he appeared in 73 games (66⅔ innings) with 4 wins, 4 losses, 14 holds, and a 4.05 ERA, playing a key role in Doosan’s closing lineup.Lee obtained FA status after the conclusion of this season and was listed as a B-grade FA. This winter, as there were not many high-profile FA pitchers, Lee was one of the top free agent pitchers and received many offers, but he chose to remain with Doosan. Doosan explained the reason for re-signing Lee, stating, “Lee has the durability to pitch over 60 innings per year on average, making him an essential player for the team. He is not only a reliable resource who will strongly support the team’s core but is also expected to serve as a leader for the young pitchers.”As Lee successfully secured a contract beyond expectations, it is expected to influence the market value of other major FA pitchers. The pitcher currently drawing the most attention is Kim Beom-su, the top left-handed relief pitcher in the FA market.Kim Beom-su, who joined Hanwha as the first pick in the 2015 rookie draft, has a KBO League career record of 481 games (538⅔ innings) pitched, 27 wins, 47 losses, 72 holds, 5 saves, and a 5.18 ERA. While his overall career stats are not as good as Lee’s, his performance this year tells a different story.Kim recorded 2 wins, 1 loss, 6 holds, 2 saves, and a 2.25 ERA in 73 games (48 innings) this year, marking his career-best season. In the postseason, he appeared in 7 games (3⅓ innings), recording 2 holds, 1 save, and a 0.00 ERA, leading Hanwha to the Korean Series for the first time in 19 years. His WAR (Wins Above Replacement) was 1.10, higher than Lee’s 0.68.Although Kim is two years older than Lee and they are left-handed and right-handed respectively, making direct comparisons difficult, Kim could also use Lee’s contract as a benchmark in negotiations. While he may not reach 5 billion Korean won, he is likely to seek a contract close to that amount.This offseason has been heated with unexpected contracts and transfers. Including Kang Baek-ho’s 4-year, 10 billion Korean won contract transfer from KT to Hanwha, a total of 9 players have secured contracts worth 43.3 billion Korean won so far. Fans are eagerly watching whether Kim will also secure a contract that will surprise everyone./fpdlsl72556@osen.co.kr",
