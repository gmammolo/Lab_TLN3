  "text": "RUIDOSO, N.M. (KRQE) – An estimated 100 to 150 families and 200 to 400 homes have been impacted by historic flooding that swept through parts of Ruidoso Tuesday, according to the initial assessments conducted by village officials. If you are interested in donating to help Ruidoso flood victims, some of whom have lost all of their belongings, there are two primary ways to do so. The Community Foundation of Lincoln County is collecting monetary donations to support victims of flooding and natural disasters in the area. “Our considerations are wide open, from the residential community, to the business community, long-term needs. Our immediate focus are the short-term needs. Our biggest priority would be to make sure that everybody has a place to sleep,” said Rikers Davis, chairman of the Community Foundation of Lincoln County . The Shelter Fund of the Community Foundation of Lincoln County launched Tuesday night and has already reached $14,000 in donations, according to Davis. “We do our best to turn it around and vet the applications. They’ve been coming in by the dozens today, and we vet the applications quickly, and we turn around and write a check to help people out,” Davis explained. Click here to learn more about the foundation, how to apply for financial assistance, and to donate online. The Humane Society of Lincoln County is accepting physical donations at its location on 25962 US Hwy 70 in Ruidoso. What to donate: Staff ask that donations are clean and in good condition. Donations can be dropped off during designated hours: 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. **Note: Please check with the Humane Society of Lincoln County to see if their needs have changed and/or if they are still accepting donations. Other groups and organizations may be collecting monetary and physical donations. It is recommended that you research the entity collecting donations ahead of time to ensure that the donation effort is legitimate. The New Mexico Department of Justice has a tool where people can look up charities and view if that charity is registered, where they allocate their funds, tax information and more. NMDOJ also has a list of resoruces on how to donate safely here . In additon to making sure the organization you are donating to is legitimate, it is also good to check with with the organization ahead of time to see which items they are collecting and if they are still accepting donations, as needs may change.
