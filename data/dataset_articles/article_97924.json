  "text": "3 CSI men’s basketball players make Division One commitments\nGolden Eagles trio secures next-level opportunities amid strong season start\nTWIN FALLS, Idaho (KMVT/KSVT) — Three College of Southern Idaho men’s basketball players have signed to play Division One basketball next year as the team enjoys a strong start to the season.\nJalen Lyn, Nate Ahner and Ben Thornbrue completed their signings to focus on the remainder of the current season over the next few months.\nThornbrue said his recruiting process was straightforward after visiting Bradley University in Illinois. He said he loved the campus and felt the program’s interest in return, which influenced his decision.\n“They {Bradley} tried to actually get me to go see if we could get me there this season and then that ended up not working out came to CSI and they offered me pretty early during the Jamboree’s and I just felt like I went on my visit there and it was a great opportunity,” Thornbrue said. “They have like a family-based program and I feel like I just fit their play style really well.”\nThornbrue described his play style as a mismatch hunter, using his height to post up smaller guards while using his speed to beat bigger defenders. He credited the CSI coaching staff for helping develop his skills.\nPoint guard Jalen Lyn signed with Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Lyn credited the junior college path with his ability to grow as a player both on and off the court.\n“It definitely helped my mental toughness just knowing I got to stick things through and just figure stuff out on my own and just try my best every day and put my best foot forward,” Lyn said. “I’m just extremely grateful to just be on this opportunity and having teammates to put myself in that position to do great. So it’s all credit to them in the coaching staff.”\nLyn was also named the Scenic West Athletic Conference’s Player of the Week for his performance in last week’s tournament in Wyoming as he averaged 23 points, 2.5 assists and 6.5 rebounds in a pair of wins.\nThe third Golden Eagle signing was sophomore forward Nate Ahner of Copenhagen, Denmark, who signed with Oakland University. Oakland upset Kentucky in March Madness a few years ago, which Ahner said may have influenced his decision.\n“Maybe it did a little bit because I like the underdog mentality. I’ve always been an underdog,” Ahner said. “So them having that type of mentality of not being scared of anyone just dreaming big is something I really love and see myself doing a lot.”\nYou can catch these three and the rest of the unbeaten and 13th-ranked College of Southern Idaho men’s basketball team at home on Friday and Saturday at 7 p.m.\nCopyright 2025 KMVT.
