  "text": "Tank fire extinguished at CITGO after lightning strike\nSULPHUR, La. (KPLC) - Emergency crews put out a tank fire this afternoon at CITGO.\nThe fire was burning at Cit-Con, often referred to as CLAW (CITGO Lubricant and Wax Plant).\nAround 1:25 p.m., lightning struck a tank at CITGO Lake Charles Refinery and ignited a fire, CITGO said in a statement. Emergency crews responded immediately and worked to extinguish the fire for around three and a half hours.\nJared Maze, Calcasieu’s Director of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said an oil/gas substance was burning and there is no offsite impact at this time.\n“We have the State Department of Environmental Quality monitoring, they’re not picking up any particulates at this time,” Maze said. “Right now there’s no impact to the residents in the surrounding area. They can go about their business, just stay tuned to local media.”\nMaze said DEQ will send out an alert to residents’ phones if any danger to the public arises.\nCITGO said all regulatory agencies have been notified, and all personnel are accounted for.\n“The safety of our employees, community and environment remains our top priority and will guide our actions as we respond to this incident,\" CITGO said in a statement.\nCopyright 2025 KPLC.
