The score was tied 15-15 going into the break.\nIn the second half Waterford was able to get some separation and ended up pulling out the nine-point win.\nThe Cats start the year 1-0. Next up is Clash at the Coliseum this Friday and Saturday at Warren high school.\nSee an error in our reporting? Send us an email by clicking here!\nCopyright 2025 WTAP. All rights reserved.",
