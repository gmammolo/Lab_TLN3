  "text": "AUSTIN (KXAN) — The Central Texas Food Bank, or CTFB, announced Thursday in a press release that it would hold two special emergency distributions for three counties impacted by the July 4 floods. CTFB said its first distribution would take place in Burnet County Friday from 1-2 p.m. at 549 East Farm-to-Market Road 243 in Bertram. The second distribution will take place Monday in Llano County from 4-6 p.m. at the Kingsland Community Center located at 3451 Rose Hill Drive. Travis County will also have daily distributions, with no fixed hours, at the Round Mountain Baptist Church at 14500 Round Mountain Road in Leander, according to CTFB. “We recognize that in times like these, having access to nutritious food and clean water can help restore strength, stability, and a sense of normalcy during a time of crisis,” said Sari M. Vatske, Central Texas Food Bank president and CEO. As of Thursday, Travis County confirmed there have been seven people killed and 10 missing after the July 4 flooding event. Burnet County said five people were killed and one person is missing, which is Michael Phillips, the chief of the Marble Falls Area Volunteer Fire Department.
