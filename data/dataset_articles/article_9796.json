  "text": "Over 30 people were rescued after a tunnel partially collapsed in Wilmington on Wednesday night. More than 100 firefighters responded to the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel Project near 1701 Figueroa St. just before 8 p.m., according to the Los Angeles Fire Department .

The 27 workers were 400 feet underground when part of the tunnel caved in. KNX News’ Jon Baird reported that the workers had to climb over a large pile of dirt to get through the other side. The four others who tried to help didn’t emerge from the tunnel entrance until nearly two hours later. The workers that were rescued were uninjured, LAFD officials said. A woman who lives in the area told Baird she was thrilled that they all got out safely. “We were praying for them when it happened,” she said. “My friend called me and she told me to pray, so we did. We prayed. We started praying for the men, and they all came out OK, so that was beautiful.” The cause of the collapse is unclear. L.A. County Supervisor Janice Hahn told Baird there will be an investigation. Follow KNX News 97.1 FM",
