  "text": "The return of Auston Matthews, Matthew Knies and Nicolas Roy, along with outstanding goaltending from Joseph Woll, helped get the Maple Leafs back into the win column Wednesday.\nBut it was left to William Nylander to be the hero.\nNylander scored with 19 seconds remaining in overtime, a wrist shot from the slot, as the Leafs beat the Columbus Blue Jackets 2-1.\n“After everything we’ve been going through, it’s nice to get (a win),” Nylander told Sportsnet after the game. “We battled back late, and we won in it overtime.\n“It’s good to start a road trip off with a win. Those haven’t been coming by so often.”\nNylander had been the recipient of a tongue-lashing from coach Craig Berube early in the third period but in typical fashion rose above the criticism and ended up with two points, including a team-record 15th career overtime goal.\n“It’s good to be on the same page with everything that’s happening out there,” Nylander said of his relationship with Berube.\nA game that had gone without a goal — at least one that counted — ended when Zach Werenski broke a scoreless tie with less than seven minutes remaining in the third. But Leafs rookie Easton Cowan tied the game with 3:14 remaining, one-timing a pass from Nylander after John Tavares won a battle behind the Columbus net.\n“We found a way to win the game, which is the most important thing,” Berube said. “We ended up winning in OT. Hopefully we can get some swagger, some confidence, going into the next game and go from there.”\nThe Leafs got their second win on the road this season, and their second win in their last nine games (2-5-2). They couldn’t have done it without the heroics of Woll, making his fifth straight start and rebounding from a second-period pull Saturday.\nWoll made big stop after big stop with Adam Fantilli, Miles Wood and Sean Monahan among those who might want police to look into grand larceny charges.\nThe captain returns\nMatthews played for the first time in six games, and was the Leafs’ best forward. He played 24:36, tops among forwards, and had a couple of prime scoring chances, including in overtime. The Leafs were 1-3-1 in his absence. He offered his review of the team as he watched from the sidelines.\n“There were stretches where we had really good moments throughout games and there were stretches where we failed to be connected,” he said. “The main focus (is) going out there and taking care of your line, taking care of your job, competing. It doesn’t have to be a special play every single shift. It’s just winning your shift and going from there and rolling over all four lines and being able to do that and compete over a full 60 minutes.”\nFor the first time in a while, the Leafs could say they did that, playing an engaged, energetic game, battling for pucks and pushing back when pushed. Knies and Roy had each missed three games, but getting the captain back mattered most.\n“It’s a boost for our team, for morale, getting our captain back,” Berube said. “The three guys that came in tonight were really good.”\nTo make room on the roster, the Leafs waived forward Sammy Blais and sent centre Jacob Quillan to the AHL Marlies.\n“It’s been a tough couple of weeks but I think over the last four or five days or so, skating, practising, I started to feel really good,” Matthews told reporters after an optional morning skate. “Stack some positive momentum.”\nPenalty trouble\nThe boost the Leafs had hoped for didn’t exactly come in the first period. It’s not that Matthews, Knies and Roy didn’t play well. In fact, Knies had the best scoring chance. And the Leafs at even strength seemed confident and moved the puck well.\nIt’s just that the Leafs, as usual, were their own worst enemies. They had to play the first 20 minutes mostly in their own end — a theme this season — because they took three minors, none of them very egregious but none particularly necessary.\nBerube’s anger was directed toward the officials for what looked like ticky-tacky calls against his team. The Blue Jackets were saints in the eyes of the officials, who apparently missed Zach Aston-Reece’s cross-checks to Dakota Mermis, but caught Mermis’s retaliation for a roughing minor.\nThe Jackets led on shots 11-6 as a result of the tilted penalty calls, though only one of Columbus’s shots was from a high-danger area. The Leafs got four high-danger shots on Jet Greaves.\nVideo review\nIt felt inevitable that the Blue Jackets would score first. And they kinda-sorta did, but the Leafs’ video coaches were on the ball and noted that Kent Johnson was offside, erasing Werenski’s wrist shot that beat Woll.\nIt was a low-event game through 40 minutes, the kind Berube likes. The Leafs had somewhat of a better middle frame than usual; they have been outscored 32-21 in the second period this season. They didn’t play in their own zone nearly as much as they have in recent weeks, and they weren’t outscored. But they didn’t score themselves. A late power play tilted the ice in the Leafs’ favour, and they outshot the Blue Jackets 9-7.\nNotes\nWinger Dakota Joshua was scratched for the first time this season, while winger Mattias Maccelli was scratched for the second time, joining defenceman Philippe Myers on the sidelines … Defenceman Brandon Carlo had his first on-ice session since suffering an undisclosed injury Nov. 13 … The Leafs play back-to-back games Friday in Washington and Saturday in Pittsburgh.",
