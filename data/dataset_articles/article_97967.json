  "text": "Kylian Mbappe lit up Athens with a stunning four-goal performance as Real Madrid edged Olympiacos 4-3 in a breathless Champions League clash. It was a night that swung wildly from Mbappe’s brilliance to defensive chaos for Real Madrid. Ultimately, it settled into another showcase of the Frenchman’s unstoppable finishing. Madrid arrived winless in last three matches and were missing five defenders, yet Mbappe powered Los Blancos to a hard-fought victory.\nOlympiacos struck first through Francisco Chiquinho’s crisp strike from distance, which sparked belief inside the Karaiskakis. But belief lasted just moments as Mbappe dismantled the game inside seven minutes. Madrid climbed to fifth in the standings with 10 points, just three behind leaders Arsenal. Meanwhile, Olympiacos remain deep in the bottom pack, 33rd on two points.\nThe French striker produced the second-fastest UCL hat-trick ever as he scored in 22nd, 24th and the 29th minute. Courtesy of Mbappe’s fantastic display, Madrid finally had their first competitive away win in Athens after nine failed attempts. Mbappe’s fourth arrived after Olympiacos had threatened a second-half revival. Mbappe silenced the crowd once more with a simple finish from Vinicius Junior’s cut-back.\nAlso Read: Liverpool Collapse Again As PSV Run Riot at Anfield\nEven then, the Greek side kept swinging, with Mehdi Taremi and Ayoub El Kaabi both heading in to keep the tie alive late on. Madrid’s defence cracked, wobbled, and leaked chances but Mbappe had already done enough to survive every punch thrown back. Mbappe is now the Champions League’s top scorer with nine goals in five matches.\nReal Madrid’s dominance in attack was clear from the moment Vinicius sliced open Olympiacos’ backline for the opener. Mbappe timed his run perfectly and rolled home the equaliser, before guiding in Arda Guler’s cross and beating the line again to complete his hat-trick from Eduardo Camavinga’s pass. But Olympiacos refused to fold.\nAlso Read: Idrissa Gueye Red Card: What Happened That Led to One of Premier League’s Most Bizarre Cards?\nTaremi’s towering header injected belief, and El Kaabi’s late finish dragged tension back into a match that felt over an hour earlier. With a patched-up back four and no Thibaut Courtois, Madrid’s defensive fragility was exposed repeatedly.",
