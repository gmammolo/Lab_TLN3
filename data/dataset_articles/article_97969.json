  "text": "Arsenal maintained their flawless Champions League campaign with a commanding 3-1 victory over Bayern Munich at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night, extending their perfect record to five wins from five matches and claiming top spot in the league phase table. The thrilling encounter saw Mikel Arteta’s side produce a dominant second-half display to dispatch the German champions, who suffered their first defeat of the season across all competitions.​\nTimber Opens Scoring Before Teenage Wonder Strikes Arsenal seized the initiative in the first half when defender Jurrien Timber headed home from Bukayo Saka’s expertly delivered corner, glancing his effort past Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to give the Gunners an early advantage. However, Bayern responded with quality and composure as 17-year-old sensation Lennart Karl equalized against the run of play. Joshua Kimmich’s precise pass found former Arsenal winger Serge Gnabry on the flank, who cushioned a first-time ball into Karl’s path, and the teenager coolly volleyed into the roof of the net to become Bayern’s youngest Champions League goalscorer this season.​\nSecond-Half Surge Seals Statement Victory Arsenal dominated proceedings after the interval, with substitutes making the decisive difference in a clinical attacking display. The breakthrough arrived in the 69th minute when Bayern defender Dayot Upamecano surrendered possession in a dangerous area, allowing Arsenal to pounce. Riccardo Calafiori whipped in a dangerous cross that Noni Madueke dispatched from six yards out, scoring his first goal for the Gunners following his return from a two-month knee injury. The third goal came from a devastating counter-attack as Eberechi Eze released Gabriel Martinelli with a long ball, and the Brazilian beat Neuer to the loose ball before racing clear to finish into an empty net, marking his return to action after a month-long absence.​\nChampions League Dominance Continues The victory propelled Arsenal to the summit of the 36-team Champions League table with a perfect record of 15 points from five matches, establishing a three-point cushion over Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan, Real Madrid , and Bayern Munich, who all sit on 12 points. Arsenal have now scored 18 goals while conceding just five in the competition, with Karl’s first-half strike ending their clean sheet streak. Former Tottenham striker Harry Kane endured a frustrating evening at his most prolific away ground, failing to register a single shot as Arsenal fans taunted him with chants throughout the match.​\nArteta’s Men Fire Warning to European Rivals This commanding performance represented Arsenal’s third match in a week of outstanding form, sandwiched between their 4-1 north London derby demolition of Spurs and an upcoming clash with second-placed Chelsea . The Gunners demonstrated their credentials as genuine European contenders with a complete display that showcased defensive solidity, set-piece prowess, and ruthless counter-attacking football. Bayern Munich, who had won their opening four Champions League fixtures, now face the challenge of regrouping before returning to Bundesliga action against St. Pauli on Saturday.​",
