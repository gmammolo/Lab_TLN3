  "text": "Olympic Flame Ignites for Milan-cortina Games with 70 days remaining until the start of the Winter Olympics in Italy this February, the‍ Olympic flame⁤ was lit yesterday in Olympia , Greece. ⁢the traditional⁣ ceremony, typically performed using sunlight adn a parabolic mirror at the⁣ Temple ​of ⁤Hera, was moved indoors to the Archaeological Museum of Olympia due to ⁢a forecast of rain and strong winds. The flame was successfully lit using a ‍fire ​obtained during Monday’s rehearsal,despite clear skies appearing during the official ceremony.\nItalian​ winter sports legends Stefania Belmondo (cross-country skiing) and Armin Zöggeler (luge) ⁣were among the first torchbearers. The flame will now embark ⁣on a nine-day tour of⁢ Greece,visiting 23 regions and 12 ski resorts.\nOn December 4th, the⁣ flame will arrive in​ Rome,⁣ initiating a 63-day relay across Italy.The ⁣route will span 12,000 kilometers, encompassing all 110 italian provinces from Trento⁢ in the⁣ north to Sicily in the⁤ south. Key cities along the way include Naples at Christmas and Bari around the New Year. ‌A⁢ total of 10,001 torchbearers will participate in carrying⁢ the ⁢flame to its final destination: the⁢ opening ceremony at Milan’s San Siro stadium ⁣on February 6th.",
