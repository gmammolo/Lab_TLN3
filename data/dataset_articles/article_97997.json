  "text": "Illinois ⁤State Heads to ESPN Events invitational with‌ High Expectations & Impressive Early Season Run ORLANDO,‌ FL – ‌The⁤ Illinois ⁣state Redbirds are gearing ‍up for ⁣a challenging test at the ESPN Events Invitational, ⁢entering ⁤the tournament with momentum from a ‍strong start ⁢to‌ the season and critically important preseason‌ recognition. Through⁤ six games, Illinois State has demonstrated an ⁣explosive offensive capability, recording 11 scoring ⁣runs of at least eight⁣ consecutive points, highlighted by a dominant 21-0 first-half‌ surge against Rockford.\nThe Redbirds boast ‍a roster returning a substantial amount of scoring power – 1,786‌ points,⁢ representing 65.49 percent of last season’s total -⁣ the fifth-highest returning point total in the NCAA and​ ranking 10th nationally ​in ⁢returning scoring percentage. This experience, ‌coupled with key returning‌ players, has ​fueled high expectations for the 2025-26 season.\nIllinois State has been picked to win the ⁢Missouri Valley⁣ Conference by multiple publications,including Mid-Major​ Madness,Lindy’s Basketball Magazine,and blue Ribbon Basketball Magazine,and also the MVC media poll. Forward Chase Walker ​has ‍been widely recognized as a potential MVC Player of​ the Year, earning Preseason Player of the​ year honors from Mid-Major Madness, Lindy’s Basketball Magazine, Blue Ribbon Basketball magazine, and The Field of 68. Guard Johnny Kinziger was named to the Preseason First Team by Blue Ribbon Basketball Magazine and Lindy’s Basketball Magazine.\nAdding to⁤ the team’s early success,​ freshman Ty’Reek‍ Coleman was recently⁢ named the MVC Freshman of the Week, becoming the third Redbird⁣ to receive the ⁢honor, joining teammates Johnny Kinziger (Jan. 29, 2024 and Feb. ‌26, 2024) and ‌Jack Daugherty (Dec.⁣ 23, 2025).\nIn a nod to ⁣tradition, Illinois State⁤ remains one of only 15 schools nationwide that has not⁢ utilized the NCAA’s recent allowance of non-customary⁣ jersey numbers,​ maintaining a ​roster limited to the 0-5 range since the rule change in the 2023-24 season.",
