  "text": "Florida firefighters join rescue efforts in Texas amid severe flooding\nGAINESVILLE, Fla. (WCJB) - Members of North Central Florida Fire Rescue are currently assisting with rescue efforts in Texas, following severe flooding.\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis authorized the deployment of six members from Florida Task Force Eight, including teams from Gainesville, Ocala, and Marion County Fire Rescue.\nAmong the team is District Chief Devin Chapman from Gainesville Fire Rescue.\nDeSantis emphasized the state’s search and rescue capabilities.\n“Florida has a robust search and rescue system where we take care of a lot of our own emergencies, we want to be on the ground immediately for our citizens and be able to take care of them,” DeSantis said. “But also, when we can, we will reach out to other communities and assist them, and we have a history of doing that.”\nThis week, Task Force Eight was dispatched to areas where flash floods have submerged roadways and overwhelmed drainage systems.\nClick here to subscribe to our newsletter.\nCopyright 2025 WCJB.
