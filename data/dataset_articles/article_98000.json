  "text": "Mourinho Full of Praise: Ajax ‘s Belgian Winger Fully Surprises Him AMSTERDAM – José Mourinho singled out ajax winger Mika Godts for high praise following Benfica ‘s 2-0 Champions ‌League victory over ‍the Dutch club‍ on Tuesday evening, ‍admitting he was particularly impressed by the Belgian’s attacking threat. While acknowledging Rayane Bounida’s confidence, ‌it was Godts who truly caught the Portuguese coach’s eye.\nDespite Ajax’s challenging season, godts has emerged as a luminous spot, contributing 5 goals and 5 assists in 16 matches. This performance has not gone unnoticed by ⁣Mourinho,who revealed his tactical focus shifted ⁣to containing the young Belgian’s dangerous runs. The praise comes as Ajax navigates a period of rebuilding, and Godts’ ⁤continued strong form could be pivotal for the club’s future and potentially attract‌ attention from larger European leagues.\nMourinho explained his team⁣ specifically adjusted their defensive‌ strategy to neutralize Godts. “What I like about Bounida​ is his confidence to go one-on-one, to take on the game,” Mourinho said after the match, as reported by Play Sports . “I ‌think the left winger (Godts, ed.) is also a Belgian, right? ⁣Mokio? yes, I ⁤know him too. But the left winger ⁢is really very good. He is dangerous. We tried to protect our right back,especially on the inside,as Godts is dangerous.”\nThree Belgians – Godts, Bounida, and substitute Jorthy Mokio – featured in the⁣ match for Ajax. While Mourinho admitted his ​initial unfamiliarity with‌ Bounida, relying on his analysts for information, he was well aware​ of Godts’ capabilities. Godts is a product of the anderlecht and Racing Genk youth academies.",
