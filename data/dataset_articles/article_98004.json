  "text": "Perth Pitch Deemed Suitable Despite Rapid test finish, Receives High​ ICC Rating Perth, Australia -⁣ November 27, 2025 – The pitch at⁢ Optus Stadium ‌in Perth, ⁤site of the truncated first Ashes Test⁢ between Australia and England , ‌has been rated as “good” by the International Cricket Council (ICC), despite the match concluding in just two days. The swift finish,due to challenging ​batting⁢ conditions,sparked debate but has not resulted in‌ sanction for the venue.\nThe unexpectedly short Test forced contingency planning for those involved and cost Cricket Australia ‍approximately $4m in lost revenue,according ⁤to officials. Despite the frustrations,Cricket Australia’s head of operations,Peter Allsopp,maintained the match was a success,citing a 60% increase in television ​viewership compared to‍ last year’s contest against India,as reported by Channel Seven.\nThe rapid conclusion of the match, which ⁤saw Australia⁣ secure a dominant victory, prompted discussion about the ⁣pitch’s suitability for Test cricket. However, the ICC assessment indicates the⁢ surface ⁢met the‌ required standards. Allsopp emphasized the desire for​ pitches across Australia to possess unique characteristics, expressing optimism for an engaging contest at the Gabba next Thursday.\n“This was disappointing for‌ fans holding tickets for days ⁢three and four, but we saw some incredible moments which captivated huge viewing audiences and will inspire even ‍more kids to pick up a bat and ball this summer,” Allsopp saeid.\nThe focus ⁢now shifts to ⁤the second Test in Brisbane, were Australia ⁤will ‌aim to build on their early lead in the series.",
