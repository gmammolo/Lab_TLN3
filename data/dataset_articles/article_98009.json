  "text": "Coco Gauff, the rising star of tennis, is not only celebrated for her athletic prowess but also for her self-awareness regarding her game. Recognizing the need to address certain technical aspects, particularly her serve, Gauff enlisted the expertise of biometrics coach Gavin MacMillan. This strategic decision has yielded significant results, with her performance improving noticeably in just a few months. MacMillan’s credentials include successfully advising world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka on her serve, making his guidance a promising addition to Gauff’s training regimen.\nIn an interview, Gauff expressed her commitment to continual growth: “I feel like I’m constantly trying to evolve and get better. It’s not anything against the coaches I worked with – I can still be at the top and want to get better.” She emphasized that while previous coaches may have provided similar feedback, sometimes a new perspective can lead to breakthroughs in understanding and execution.\nAt just 21 years old, Gauff already boasts two Grand Slam titles, positioning her as a formidable competitor in upcoming tournaments. With her achievements, including reaching the semifinals in 2024 and the quarterfinals in 2025, she has become one of only four Americans to claim a Grand Slam title before turning 21. This puts her in impressive company, following in the footsteps of the legendary Williams sisters, whom she has long admired.\nGauff began her tennis journey at the age of six, inspired by Serena and Venus Williams, both of whom reshaped women’s tennis over the course of their careers. Serena’s extraordinary record of 319 weeks at No. 1 and 23 Grand Slam singles titles stand as benchmarks in the sport’s history. For Gauff, the Williams sisters not only provided motivation but also represented a diversity that was often lacking in professional tennis, empowering her in an environment where athletes who looked like her were few and far between.\nBeyond her on-court achievements, Gauff has also carved out a distinct identity as a vocal advocate for social justice. Rather than remaining silent, she has actively used her platform to champion causes such as racial equality and the call to end gun violence, further enriching her persona as both an athlete and a community leader. This multifaceted approach to her career and activism reflects a maturity that belies her age and sets her apart as a significant figure in both sports and society.",
