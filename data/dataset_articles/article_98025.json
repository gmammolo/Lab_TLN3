  "text": "Hot-shooting Pilots race past Long Beach at Chiles Center\nThe University of Portland men’s basketball team couldn’t miss Wednesday night on its way to a lopsided 93-73 home win over Long Beach State.\nThe Pilots hit three out of every four shots they tried in the second half on their way to a 51-point finish that quickly buried Long Beach on the scoreboard. Jamie O’Donnell, Tim George and Jermaine Ballisager-Webb combined to go a perfect 12-for-12 from the field after the break.\nPortland was up by a bucket early in the second half before going on an 8-0 run to take a double-digit lead. Ballisager-Webb converted a three-point play on a fastbreak dunk to put the game out of reach 84-62 with 5:22 to play.\nThe Pilots shot a blistering 35-for-50 (70%) for the game and went 17-for-19 (89.5%) from the free-throw line. Joel Foxwell and Timo shared the team lead with 19 points apiece, while Matus Hronsky added 16 points.\nPortland (5-3) is back in action Monday at Stanford.",
