  "text": "BEMIDJI — For the first time in its 30-year history, a Bemidji State women's soccer student-athlete was voted as the Division II Conference Commissioners Association (D2CCA) Women’s Soccer Central Region Player of the Year. Senior Katrina Barthelt was awarded the honor on Tuesday afternoon.\nBemidji State had two members earn D2CCA Women’s Soccer All-Central Region accolades in 2025. Barthelt and senior Emma Huelsnitz, who garnered All-Central Region First Team nods, are the 12th and 13th Beavers to receive D2CCA All-Central Region First Team honors. It's the first time since 2021 that two have earned first-team recognition in the same season.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBarthelt repeated as the NSIC Offensive Player of the Year in 2025 for just the fourth time in the conference’s history. During the regular season, she finished with a career-high 32 points to lead the conference and tied for the league's lead with 13 goals. She scored in 10 matches during the season, with BSU going 8-0-2 when she scored. Twice she earned NSIC Offensive Players of the Week honors during the season and was the NSIC’s Elite 18 Award winner and Outstanding Senior Award winner.\nThis is the third time in Barthelt's career that she has been named All-Central Region by the D2CCA. The Bartlett, Illinois, native has built an impressive resume at Bemidji State, ranking sixth in the program in career points (87) and fourth in career goals (38).\nHuelsnitz makes her first appearance on the D2CCA All-Region list. Huelsnitz returned for her redshirt senior season and started every match for the Beavers for the second consecutive fall. The Ramsey native logged a team-best and career-high 1,775 minutes on the pitch, anchoring the Beavers' defense that finished second in the NSIC, allowing just 10 goals during the regular season .\nHuelsnitz has helped the Beavers' defense earn 12 clean sheets this season, tied for the fourth most in program history. Offensively, Huelsnitz scored a goal from the backline and posted eight shots, three of which were on target.\nBemidji State finished the 2025 season with a 14-3-4 record and made its sixth appearance in the NCAA DII Women’s Soccer Tournament.",
