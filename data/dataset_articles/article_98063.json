  "text": "No. 16 Kansas recovered from an 0-2 trip to Utah with a four-set victory over No. 21 Iowa State in Ames, Iowa, on Wednesday. The Jayhawks won the first and second sets, 25-23 and 25-16. The Cyclones won the third set, 25-15. Kansas won the fourth set, 26-24.\nKansas was down 19-15 in the fourth set, but went on a 4-0 run to tie the set. The teams traded points until the set was tied at 23.\nKansas broke the streak of trading points with a Selena Leban kill to get to match point. Iowa State came right back with a kill of its own to send the set to extra points. Kansas scored each of the next two to secure the win.\nThe Cyclones had successfully completed a reverse sweep in their last match against West Virginia. They are also undefeated in five-set matches this season, so Kansas winning the fourth set was crucial.\nCristin Cline finished the match with a double-double. She had 44 assists and a season-high 16 digs. She already had 10 assists and seven digs by the end of the first set.\nReese Ptacek was the only Jayhawk with double-digit kills. She had 14 with a hitting percentage of .407.\nBoth teams made early mistakes, but the Cyclones made more in their home arena. Iowa State committed five attack errors to just three kills heading into the first timeout of the set, by which point Kansas was winning 12-7. Each team had two service errors before that timeout.\nBoth teams also had one ace by that timeout. Cyclones outside hitter Nayeli Ti'a sent one directly at Ryan White, who couldn’t make the pass. Kansas setter Cristin Cline placed a serve just inside the sideline, and Iowa State did not play the ball.\nThe Jayhawks hit consistently well in the first half of the set. They were hitting .333 at the first timeout, when they led 12-7. They were still hitting .333 when the Cyclones called their second timeout with Kansas leading 18-11.\nIowa State came out of that timeout with a 7-2 run, forcing a Kansas timeout as the Cyclones cut a seven-point lead to two. The second point on that run came on a powerful double block from Lilly Wachholz and Abbi Brenizer.\nIowa State scored the first point out of that timeout, and the teams traded every point for the rest of the set. Kansas took its two-point lead the distance and won the first set 25-23.\nKansas got out to a lead even earlier in the second set, opening with a 7-1 run. Jovana Zelenovic had two kills, two aces and a block assist in that run for a total of six of those seven points.\nThe Jayhawks used that early run to cruise to a set two victory.\nIowa State scored the first point of the third set to get its first lead of the match. Grace Nelson answered with a solo block.\nThe set was tied 5-5 when Cyclones libero Rachel Van Gorp’s shoelaces broke. The Iowa State equipment staff had spare shoelaces, and Iowa State called a timeout to get the laces replaced. Van Gorp recorded an assist on the next play to Wachholz. That assist was the start of an 8-3 run for the Cyclones.\nA long rally happened with a 15-9 Iowa State lead in the third set. Each side recorded several digs before Kansas native Alea Goolsby tooled a Jayhawks block to give the Cyclones the point. Iowa State won the third set, 25-15.\nThe fourth set opened with four straight service errors. Iowa State shortly took a slight advantage, but could not build a lead of more than four points. It led 15-11 at the media timeout. Kansas head coach Matt Ulmer challenged the Iowa State point that led into that timeout. The call was reversed and the score became 14-12.\nKansas will wrap up its regular season in Lawrence on Saturday against UCF. First serve is scheduled for 1 p.m. and the game will be available on ESPN+.",
