  "text": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is deploying extensive emergency resources to assist Central Texas communities impacted by recent severe flooding.\n“As a native Texan, this disaster is deeply personal, and I want the people of Central Texas to know the USDA will be by their side through the totality of this response and long-term recovery,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins said.\nMultiple disaster assistance programs have been established to support farmers and ranchers. These include crop insurance, livestock indemnity, emergency assistance programs, tree replacement aid, and conservation restoration initiatives. Details and eligibility are available on farmers.gov .\nUSDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is supporting livestock operations, with guidance available on protecting animals during disasters.\nResponse efforts involve multiple other federal agencies:\nThe U.S. Forest Service (USFS) is coordinating with state and local partners to support debris removal, hazard mitigation, and search and rescue operations. Trained crews and incident management teams from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi have been deployed for debris clearance and hazard reduction, with law enforcement officers assisting in ongoing rescue efforts.\nThe Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is monitoring watershed structures, deploying connectivity devices to offices, and coordinating flood control inspections. The agency continues to engage with the Texas Division of Emergency Management and local officials, providing updates on available assistance programs such as the Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP).\nNutrition assistance has been expanded to affected households. As of July 8, USDA authorized the use of SNAP benefits for hot food purchases in seven counties through August 7. The agency also waived the 10-day reporting requirement for SNAP households in 21 counties to report food loss, effective through August 4, 2025.\nFood safety guidance includes recommendations for residents to reduce foodborne illness risks following flood exposure, such as using only bottled water, discarding flood-exposed foods and porous items, and thoroughly sanitizing utensils and surfaces.\n*Featured photo is for reference only.",
