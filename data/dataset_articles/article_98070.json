  "text": "Hopkinsville’s girls swim team put together a steady, well-rounded showing Saturday, placing third at the annual Rick Cohn Invitational inside the Rick Cohn Aquatic Center.\nThe Lady Tigers picked up points in nearly every phase of the meet. Grace Cansler turned in the team’s highest individual finish, taking second in the 100-yard breaststroke. She and Lily Johnston later added top-five efforts in the 50-yard freestyle, helping Hoptown stay near the top of the standings.\nSaralynn Major and Kaley Bangart also provided a lift in the sprint events. Major finished fourth in the 100-yard freestyle and sixth in the 50, while Bangart placed fifth in the 100. Johnston added another strong result with a third-place swim in the 100-yard butterfly.\nHopkinsville’s relay teams continued the momentum. The Lady Tigers earned third in both the 200-yard medley and 200-yard freestyle relays, and placed fifth in the 400-yard freestyle relay. The program’s “B” squad also cracked the top 10 with a sixth-place finish in the 200 freestyle relay.\nBowling Green claimed the girls team title with 87 points, followed by Muhlenberg County’s 63. Hopkinsville secured third with 42.\nSeveral more Lady Tigers landed inside the top 10:\n— Bangart finished seventh in the 200-yard freestyle.\n— Sarah Kate Gilliam was 10th in the same event.\n— Evelyn Bangart claimed ninth in the 100 free.\n— Brilyn Merrick earned eighth in the 100 backstroke.\nOn the boys side, Hopkinsville finished ninth overall, collecting five points. Levi Johnston led the Tigers with two fifth-place swims — one in the 50-yard freestyle and another in the 100-yard butterfly.\nDistance swimmer Owen Lockhart placed sixth in the 500-yard freestyle, and his brother Simon Lockhart earned 10th in the 200-yard individual medley. The Tigers’ 200-yard freestyle relay rounded out the day with a 10th-place finish.\nBowling Green also won the boys championship, topping the field with 78 points. Muhlenberg County followed with 71, and Henderson County finished third with 35.",
