  "text": "Published : 11 Jul 2025, 03:10 AM\nThe unrelenting heavy rainfall is set to dissipate by Friday, easing the distress from localised flooding and other consequences around the country.\nThe Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) has lifted all maritime warnings for the ports, as the threat of strong winds over the northern Bay of Bengal and coastal areas has subsided.\nOn Thursday, the Met Office instructed Chattogram, Cox’s Bazar, Mongla, and Payra ports to lower their cautionary signals.\nMeteorologist Tariful Newaz Kabir said that the low-pressure system that was lingering over Gangetic West Bengal and surrounding areas has weakened and merged with the monsoon trough.\nAs a result, rainfall on Thursday has been less intense than in previous days, and is expected to continue weakening from Friday.\nIn a media statement, the Met Office said the monsoon trough now extends across Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and the central region of Bangladesh, reaching as far as Assam.\nIt added that a branch of the trough also extends to the northern Bay of Bengal. The monsoon is currently active over Bangladesh and moderate over the northern Bay.\nLight to moderate rain or thundershowers accompanied by gusty winds may occur at many places in Dhaka, Khulna, Barishal, Chattogram, and Sylhet divisions, and at a few places in Rangpur, Rajshahi, and Mymensingh divisions within the next 24 hours.\nSome areas in Dhaka, Khulna, Barishal, Chattogram, and Sylhet Divisions may also experience moderate to heavy rainfall. Day and night temperatures across the country are expected to rise slightly.\nIn the past 24 hours until Thursday, the highest recorded rainfall was in Ramgati, Lakshmipur, with 85mm. Gopalganj recorded 80mm, Baghabari in Rajshahi 73mm, and Aricha 71mm.\nDuring the same period, the highest temperature was 33°C in Dimla, Nilphamari, and the lowest was 21°C in Madaripur.",
