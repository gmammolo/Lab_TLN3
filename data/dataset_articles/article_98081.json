  "text": "BRONX — The Hobart College football team ended its 2025 season on a five-game winning streak, which included a bowl game victory.\nHobart hit the road to defeat Maritime College 42-14 on Saturday afternoon in the 2025 ECAC James Lynah Bowl.\nThe Statesmen led 21-7 at the halftime break, and they stormed their way to the victory with a dominant second half performance.\nLeading the way was junior E.J. Taylor. The Hobart running back carried the ball 19 times for 172 yards and two touchdowns.\nFor those efforts, Taylor was named Most Valuable Player for the bowl game.\nStatesmen sophomore quarterback Jeremy Weiss also contributed to the blowout victory, going 8-for-13 through the air for 186 yards and three touchdown passes. Two of the scoring tosses went to sophomore wide receiver Johnny Harding and the other went to junior wide receiver Marcus Peterson.\nGraduate student quarterback Will Pickett for Maritime (5-6) went 20-for-35 for 213 yards and one touchdown pass.\nHobart (6-5) ends this 2025 season on a high note as will look to carry over this momentum and build off of it in the 2026 season.",
