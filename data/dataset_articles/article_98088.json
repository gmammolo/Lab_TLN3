  "text": "The undefeated University of Hawaiʻi women’s basketball team returns to action this weekend, hosting the three-day Wahine Showdown at Bankoh Arena at Stan Sheriff Center beginning Friday afternoon.\nThe Rainbow Wahine (4-0) will play three games in three days, facing Vermont, Lindenwood, and Santa Clara from Friday through Sunday. All games are scheduled to tip off at 2:30 p.m. and will not be televised.\nHawaiʻi received a boost last week with the return of sophomore center Ritorya Tamilo, who made her season debut after recovering from an offseason injury. The 6-foot-5 post player totaled 19 points over 33 minutes across two victories.\nView this post on Instagram Head coach Laura Beeman said the staff will continue to manage Tamilo’s workload carefully.\n“She’s happy to be on the floor, first off. You don’t want to be hurt and on the bench,” Beeman said. “Tory is just an amazing young lady, great energy, great leader. We just want her on the court so we can continue to develop our chemistry moving forward.”\n“It’s going to be me checking in with our trainer and strength coach and making sure we’re following the plan they have,” Beeman added. “If it’s limited minutes, then we limit minutes. If she’s OK, we’ll check in every day. It’s definitely a game-by-game situation. We’ll do absolutely nothing to re-aggravate that injury or cause any further harm.”",
