  "text": "Four South Australian companies have received top honours at this year's Australian Export Awards, including a next-generation sports technology innovator that took home their third national award in four years.\nMyVenue, whose point-of-sale technology is used at some of the biggest sports and entertainment arenas and stadiums across the world, won the Technologies Exporter Award at the 63rd Australian Export Awards last night.\nFounded as a small start-up in 2020, the company's rapid success has seen it expand to be used in more than 250 venues worldwide, including Dodger Stadium, Hard Rock Stadium, State Farm Stadium, Rogers Place, and Lumen Field.\nMyVenue won the Emerging Exporter Award in 2022 and the Small Business Award in 2023.\nMyVenue also partnered with the South Australian Government earlier this year in a program to support the state's emerging sports technology companies as a 'mentor' company.\nAnother previous winner, Riverland-based almond producer Almondco Australia took home the Regional Exporter Award, having won the title two times previously - in 2011 and 2016.\nMunda Wines, a proudly Aboriginal-owned premium wine company founded by Wirangu and Kokatha man Pauly Vandenbergh, won the inaugural First Nations Exporter Award at the national ceremony in Canberra last night.\nCMAX, one of Australia's largest and most experienced clinical medical trial providers, based in Adelaide, won the Professional Services Export Award.\nOther companies that were nominated for national awards, after winning their South Australian categories, included:\n- Agribusiness, Food and Beverages - The Yoghurt Shop\n- Creative Industries - Foxie Games\n- e-Commerce - Foil Drive\n- Emerging Exporter - Noora Lab Tech\n- International Health - Mayne Pharma\n- Manufacturing and Advanced Materials - Novafast\n- Resources and Energy - Wilco Technologies\n- Small Business - Pixelforce\n- Sustainability and Green Economy - Balco Australia\nAs put by Joe Szakacs\nIt's tremendous to see so many South Australian companies take out the top prizes at the national export awards, which is testament to the growing momentum within the state's business community.\nSome of our state's most innovative and ambitious businesses were on show in Canberra last night - highlighting their incredible work across a range of industries.\nCongratulations to all 13 South companies that were nominated.\nThe South Australian Government is proud to deliver local and international support to the state's many new, emerging and established exporters.",
