  "text": "PERPETUAL continues to make the NCAA Season 101 men's basketball tournament its personal playground.\nAnd the Altas will bring their impressive game over to the Final Four after getting the better of young yet dangerous Jose Rizal University, 81-74, Thursday inside the Mall of Asia Arena.\nOn the back of its 1-2 punch of Mark Gojo Cruz and Patrick Sleat, Perpetual proved its mettle as Group A's surprising, but well-worthy top seed, as they had all the answers for a Heavy Bombers side that had gained quite the reputation as giant-killers from the other pool, otherwise known as the 'Group of Death.'\nThe tally was actually tied at 43-all at the seven-minute mark of the third before Gojo Cruz and Sleat joined forced for all but six points in a 19-0 tear that put the Altas ahead, 59-43, with 2:22 left in the quarter.\nStill, JRU kept coming and was just within three, 70-73, with under two minutes remaining and even had two tries to even up the score, but Sean Salvador and Justin Lozano muffed on both of their triples.\nAt the other end, Sleat drove hard to the ring and made good on a short stab then after another defensive stop, John Abis sealed the deal for good with a couple of charities.\nPerpetual helps itself\nWith that, the Las Pinas-based outfit made it through to its first semifinals since Season 94, or seven years ago. This adds to the milestone they already got in claiming their first top seed in over two decades back in Season 80.\nGojo Cruz wound up with 23 points, as Sleat stuffed the stat sheet with 14 markers on top of 10 rebounds, six assists, and two steals. Shawn Orgo also added 10 points to help Perps book the season's first ticket to the Final Four.\n\"I appreciate their willingness to execute. They're young, minsan nagkakamali sila, but for the most part, very open sila sa sasabihin ko,\" said head coach Olsen Racela, who like all of his wards, is about to experience his first NCAA semifinals.\nThe Altas now await the winner between Arellano and Letran on Friday. The Knights forced a do-or-die against the twice-to-beat Chiefs a day ago.\nREAD: Manabat hopes Arellano can conquer jitters in KO match vs. Letran\nSalvador paced the Heavy Bombers with 18 points, while fellow rookie Allen Laurenaria posted an 18-marker, 10-rebound double-double to go with three blocks, two steals, and two assists.\nTheir campaign comes to a close, but not before putting the league on notice that they will be a force to reckon with come coach Nani Epondulan's second season at the helm.\nThe Scores:\nPERPETUAL 81 – Gojo Cruz 23, Sleat 14, Orgo 10, Abis 9, Boral 7, Nuñez 6, Casinilio 4, Duremdes 2, Alcantara 2, Tulabut 2, Gelsano 2, Maglupay 0, Pagulayan 0\nJRU 74 – Salvador 18, Laurenaria 16, Lozano 11, Panapanaan 8, Duque 6, Argente 4, Garupil 4, Castillo 3, Benitez 2, Sarmiento 2, Herrera 0\nQuarters: 22-16, 41-37, 63-51, 81-74\nGet more of the latest sports news & updates on SPIN.ph\nNOTICE ON UNAUTHORIZED AND UNLAWFUL USE, PUBLICATION, AND/OR DISSEMINATION OF SPIN.PH CONTENT: Please be notified that any unauthorized and unlawful use, publication, and/or dissemination of Spin.ph’s content and/or materials is a direct violation of its legal and exclusive rights to the same, and shall be subject to appropriate legal action/s.",
