  "text": "KISSIMMEE, Fla. (WCAX) - The UVM men’s basketball team weathered a major comeback from Princeton to close the ESPN Events Invitational with a 79-74 win.\nVermont started red hot and led 43-30 with just over three minutes to play in the first half, but a 27-4 extended run spanning halftime would put Princeton in the driver’s seat as the two teams headed down the stretch.\nTrailing by three in the closing minutes, Gus Yalden hit a three to tie the game and added another bucket to finish with 27 points before Noah Barnett slammed the door with a breakaway dunk at the horn.\n“I think we just stuck together as a team,” Yalden said after the game. “One thing that I’ve learned from these guys is that we’re never out of it. Knowing this Vermont team has won some games where they just weren’t supposed to win. And I felt like that was kind of the night. You find a way to gut it out and just get that dub. And that’s what we did tonight. I’m learning from some great guys and a great team, great coaches, just a great program.”\nOn Tuesday, Rice grad Drew Bessette hit the halfcourt shot to end morning shootaround, so we caught up with the local kid.\nOn Tuesday, Rice grad Drew Bessette hit the halfcourt shot to end morning shootaround, so we caught up with the local kid. The Cats also had the support of friends, family, and fans from all over on their trip.\nThe Cats also had the support of friends, family, and fans from all over on their trip. Vermont will return home to face Yale at 2 p.m. on Sunday afternoon.\nCopyright 2025 WCAX. All rights reserved.",
