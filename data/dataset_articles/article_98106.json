  "text": "Music To My Gears motored to his sixth consecutive victory with an extended brush to the lead in an $8,000 claiming event for male pacers on Wednesday, Nov. 26 at Flamboro Downs.\nThe 13-year-old gelding was caught wide into the first turn after leaving from post five, and Daryl Thiessen dropped him in fourth to the quarter in :27.3 in the $6,000 event. After picking up a place when leader Carsons Shadow (Damian MacLellan) broke stride on the second turn, Music To My Gears was flushed out by the advancing Street Art (Samuel Fillion) near the half in :58.2.\nHe pulled alongside leader Livin Large (Travis Cullen) on the backstretch and bullied his way past him at three-quarters in 1:27.2, then was immediately faced with Outlawgrandetorino (Jason Ryan) coming off his cover. Music To My Gears rebuffed that foe on the turn for home and held him a half-length at bay to win in 1:57.2. Livin Large finished third.\nMusic To My Gears improved his seasonal tally to 22 wins in 41 starts, again tying On To Norway as the winningest horse in North America this year. The Ken Middleton trainee is now 43-for-170 lifetime with a bankroll of $214,801. Middleton co-owns the son of Rocknroll Hanover-Changing Gears with Keith Middleton of Cambridge, Ont., Jeff Seibel of Elmira, Ont. and James Grant of Sarnia, Ont. As the 1-9 favourite, Music To My Gears returned $2.20 to win.\nTo view Wednesday’s harness racing results, click the following link: Wednesday Results - Flamboro Downs.\n(Standardbred Canada)\nLog inor\ncreate an accountto post a comment.",
