  "text": "JAMAICA defeated Canada in their double-header Rugby League matches at The University of West Indies’ UWI Mona Bowl in Kingston last Saturday.\nWith international ranking points on the line the senior men’s side overcame Canada 34-12, avenging the defeat suffered to the visitors last October in Toronto. Centre Tahj-Jay Lynch, in only his second international for Jamaica, bagged a brilliant hat-trick while the junior Reggae Warriors took the inaugural U-19s clash between the nations 42-24, running in eight tries, three of them spectacular long-range efforts.\n“I would like to thank Canadian Rugby League for sending two teams, especially at a time that our country is going through so much after the hurricane here,” Jamaica’s men’s coach, Roy Calvert, said. “It has been a real morale boost.\n“We had a very rough, interrupted preparation but we stuck to it. The guys did what they were asked to, gave 80 minutes’ effort, and that pulled us over the line.”\nBack rower Jenson Morris and Lynch, with his opener, got the hosts off to a flying start. Jason Chuck, with the first of his two tries, crossed for the visitors who were behind 14-4 at the break. Ricardo Richards and Joseph Daley crossed inside four minutes straight after the break, to extend Jamaica’s lead while Chuck and winger Oliver Lenahan — who played the full U-19s game — sandwiched a further two Lynch touchdowns.\n“It was a pleasure for us to come to Jamaica,” Canada’s men’s head coach, Aaron Zimmerle, said. “I know the country is hurting after suffering through the hurricane, and for our players to see how theirs have rallied around that, there are things more important than the result.\n“We had nine debutants, and I was really proud with a couple of our younger ones — Oliver Lenahan was our most damaging player. To see him come through the Canadian player pathway system, I’m excited to see what he and others like him can become.”\nIn the U-19 curtain-raiser Lenahan crossed twice in a tight first half, with Jamaica leading 18-14 at the interval, and prop Luke Elliott proved a standout for the hosts. Brandon Gordon scored either side of the break to put them in control. Speedy centre Tyreke Hutchinson also claimed a double, and Oniel Williams finished with 16 points.\n“We are extremely grateful to Canada for coming out so that we could play this historic game,” Jamaica U-19s Coach Oshane Edie said. “They made a lot of good yards up the middle but we worked hard on coming off our line — and that paid off. Overall, we put in a good showing.\n“It was great to have an U-19s team on the pitch — a superb first experience for our boys and a good launch pad for us, moving forward,” Canada Rugby League Chair John Cameron said, “We look forward to hosting the young Warriors in a return game.”\nJamaica 34\nBen Jones Bishop, Kenneth Walker, Ricardo Richards, Tahj-Jay Lynch, Kamarine Williams, Chevaughn Bailey, Michael Pearson, Daniel Graham, Marvin Thompson, Kevin Thomas, Jenson Morris, Andrew Simpson, Owen Linton\nSubs: Aaron Jones Bishop, Kyronn Fairclough, Joseph Daley, Akeem Murray\nTries: J.
