  "text": "In a thrilling matchup in San Francisco, the Houston Rockets overcame a 12-point halftime deficit to claim a narrow 104-100 victory against the Golden State Warriors. Reed Sheppard showcased his talent, scoring a career-high 31 points while also contributing nine rebounds and five assists. The game marked a rematch of last season’s playoff series, where the Warriors triumphed in Game 7.\nJimmy Butler added 21 points, five rebounds, and five assists for the Rockets, while Alperen Sengun supported with 16 points, six rebounds, and six assists. For the Warriors, Stephen Curry scored 14 points, and rookie Will Richard impressed with 18 points. Moses Moody made a significant impact by reaching the 2,000 career points milestone and hitting a crucial 3-pointer with just six seconds remaining, closing the gap to two points for Golden State. However, a foul on Sheppard allowed him to seal the victory by converting both free throws.\nThe game had its share of drama, particularly a contested play with 3:24 remaining. With the score tied at 91, Amen Thompson’s hard drive towards the basket resulted in a collision with Curry, initially ruled an offensive foul. However, after a challenge from Houston, the call was overturned, awarding the Rockets the basket.\nThe Warriors welcomed back Draymond Green, who had been sidelined in their previous game due to a sprained right foot. Green finished the night with a solid performance, contributing 12 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists. Golden State suffered some setbacks, with center Al Horford missing his second consecutive game due to sciatica, and forward Jonathan Kuminga participating only in G League scrimmages as he recovers from knee tendinitis.\nDespite facing a sluggish first half, where they shot only 39.6% and trailed 59-47 at the break, the Rockets rallied in the second half. Following a strong finish to the third quarter by Sheppard, they opened the fourth with a swift 5-0 run that helped propel them to victory. This win marked Houston’s seventh victory in their last eight games, demonstrating their resilience and determination moving forward.\nLooking ahead, the Rockets are set for back-to-back games against the Utah Jazz, starting Sunday, while the Warriors will return home to host the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday, where they will see the return of Kevon Looney.",
