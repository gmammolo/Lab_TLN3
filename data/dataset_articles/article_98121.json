  "text": "COLUMBUS — Megan O’Reilly got the call six days before nationals: The Red Lady Raft Racing Team needed her.\nThe former Absarokee River Adventures guide boarded a flight to California, landed in Redding, drove to the small Trinity River town of Weaverville and was on the water within two hours.\nFour days later, she and her teammates were national champions.\nThe Red Ladies captured the women’s title at the Trinity River Nationals Rafting Championship, besting eight other teams across five grueling events that test both skill and endurance. The victory sends them to the 2026 World Championships, where a top-five finish could help bring raft racing to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.\n“A national title is cool and all, but for me personally I want to be a good role model for women in sport,” O’Reilly said. “Being able to do that on a world stage is important to me as whitewater is one of my largest passions, and the rivers we so love need publicity in order to be protected.”\nFive events, one weekendThe championship comprised sprint, downriver, slalom, head-to-head and time trial events, with teams earning points in each discipline.\nThe Red Ladies dominated the downriver race, a seven-mile sprint from start to finish, taking first place overall. In the 200-yard sprint through one of the river’s hardest rapids, they finished just two seconds behind the winners at 1:03.\n“This is terrifying,” O’Reilly said of the sprint. “The team has no time to slow down or make a correction. A few inches off and the boat is upside down.”\nThe most nerve-wracking moment came in slalom, a technical event requiring teams to navigate hanging pylons — green gates going downstream, red gates going upstream. Miss a gate: 50-second penalty. Touch a pylon: five seconds. Flip the boat: disqualification.\nThe Red Ladies flipped on their first run.\n“We were no longer competing against our own time — we needed a time, period,” O’Reilly said. “Or we risked losing the entire thing.”\nThey made it through the second run clean.\nFrom the Stillwater to the podiumO’Reilly’s path to a national championship began at 16, when Absarokee River Adventures called asking her to help run shuttles during Fourth of July weekend. She wasn’t sure she’d make it through that first summer.\n“I really wasn’t sure about finishing my first summer and really didn’t know what to think of the people I had spent my summer with,” she said.\nShe came back for a second season and found something different: community. Old guides kept visiting. The crew held family dinners after moving 80 people down the Stillwater in a day. They reached out during her college year, invited her on trips and showed up to ski in winter.\n“I realized then this was not just a job but a community of people not created as coworkers but because they really cared and enjoyed what they did,” O’Reilly said.\nAfter three summers in Absarokee, she headed to Colorado seeking more challenging whitewater. Her head boatman at the new company was a raft racer who “practically dragged me into a few local races before I actually started to enjoy it.”\nHer first competitive race was on the Royal Gorge of the Arkansas River — the same section she’d already run twice that day with commercial crews.\n“It sucked,” she said. “I remember being very hungry and my shoulder feeling like it might peel off of my torso at any second.”\nBut the Royal Gorge, with its diverse terrain spanning 10 miles within 50 miles of where all her teammates live, became ideal training ground.\nSmall sport, big stakesRaft racing has existed since whitewater rafting took off in the 1960s, but it remains a small sport. Most races draw 20 to 40 boats — sometimes 100 — showing up to a creek on a summer evening to share a passion and make it competitive.\nNationals is an open competition. Anyone can enter with a team fitting one of four categories: masters, open, U19 and cadet. The sport has always included a coed category, instituted early on to promote inclusivity, equality and accessibility.\nThe upcoming World Championships will be the first under one global governing body, making Olympic inclusion technically possible if enough teams attend. More than 30 nations will be represented, including teams from Japan, Brazil, Malaysia, Australia and Germany.\nBut the sport’s size could limit its Olympic future.\n“You can’t add a sport to the Olympics unless its athletes have a well enough built network and legacy to continue to show up every four years,” O’Reilly said. “In some cases there is only one team from a respected country — so what happens when that team can’t make it?”\nStill, O’Reilly said she sees value in the possibility.\n“Whitewater is my passion and it is already an extreme sport, Olympic or not,” she said. “I have mixed emotions about that possibility as well because I am not sure what impact it would have on our rivers if it became that mainstream.”\nTraining for worldsThis winter, O’Reilly will ski instruct, hit the gym — “with a lot of rowing machine” — and practice swimming and kayaking in a pool. Come spring, the team will head to rivers and lakes around Colorado, possibly venturing to other rivers nationwide to practice skills and techniques, from seating positions to emergency recovery.\n“I am not sure what a season of training will completely entail as I have never participated in more than a few practices for a singular race,” she said.\nFor O’Reilly, Montana’s rivers remain foundational.\n“Montana is a hidden gem of whitewater,” she said. “I didn’t know that until I was no longer boating there. There are so many good sections and rivers in Montana that I had the privilege to run in my first few years rafting that really shaped my expectations for the sport into something very high and respectable.”",
