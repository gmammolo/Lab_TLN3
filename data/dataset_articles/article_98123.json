  "text": "By Field Level Media ,\n33 minutes ago Montreal Canadiens left wing Florian Xhekaj (63) fights for the puck against Utah Mammoth left wing Lawson Crouse (67) and right wing JJ Peterka (77) during the second period at Delta Center. Credit: Chris Nicoll-Imagn Images Nov 26, 2025; Salt Lake City, Utah, USA Nick Suzuki scored twice in a three-point outing and Ivan Demidov completed the comeback as the Montreal Canadiens claimed a 4-3 victory over the Utah Mammoth in Salt Lake City on Wednesday.\nZachary Bolduc collected one goal and two assists for the Canadiens, who kicked off a three-game road trip with their second consecutive victory.\nGoaltender Jakub Dobes made 31 saves, including a handful in the dying minutes of regulation time while the Mammoth pushed for the equalizer.\nBarrett Hayton, Kailer Yamamoto and Michael Carcone replied for the Mammoth, who saw their two-game winning streak snapped.\nGoalie Karel Vejmelka stopped 13 shots.\nMontreal trailed going into the third period but Suzuki tied the clash with his team's second power-play goal of the clash, converting a rebound chance at 3:20 of the final frame.\nDemidov scored the game-winner 87 seconds later when he fired a seeing-eye shot inside the far post from the left circle.\nUtah came close to tying the clash again, but could not solve Dobes again.\nBoth squads claimed and lost a lead in the back-and-forth affair.\nBolduc's power-play goal just past the midway point of the first period opened scoring and snapped a 13-game goal drought, and then Suzuki doubled the lead with his 400th career point, burying a one-timer to complete a perfectly executed 3-on-2 rush at 16:37 of the opening frame.\nUtah responded with a trio of goals in a 4:09 span to take the lead. Hayton began the comeback when he finished a three-way passing play from deep in the right circle at 9:43 of the second period.\nYamamoto tied the clash just over two minutes later when he drove to the net and converted the feed from Dylan Guenther.\nCarcone put the Mammoth ahead when his wraparound attempt was denied, but he chipped the loose puck into the cage at 13:52.\nBut the Canadiens roared back and handed Utah its first regulation-time loss of the season when leading after two periods.\n--Field Level Media",
