  "text": "Owls Stun FGCU as Ellerbee Nets 42 Points in OT Thriller\nJordan Ellerbee delivered a standout performance with 42 points, but Florida Gulf Coast lost 102-100 in overtime to Kennesaw State. His score ranks as the second-highest in FGCU history and set records for both Alico Arena and the GEICO Coconut Hoops tournament. While Ellerbee shone with a stellar shooting display, the Eagles struggled with free-throw accuracy, missing 11 throughout regulation, which proved costly. Kennesaw State capitalized in the overtime period, showcasing flawless shooting to secure the victory. The Eagles are now looking to regroup after a rigorous three-game stretch.\n- Ellerbee’s 42 points are the second-most in FGCU history, only behind Tavian Dunn-Martin's 43.\n- FGCU missed 11 free throws in regulation, including seven in the second half.\n- FGCU experienced a notable performance from Ellerbee, contributing 27 points in the first half.\n- Kennesaw State's shooting in overtime was perfect, converting 100% of their attempts.\nFollowing a week off, FGCU will face FIU on December 3, aiming to bounce back from the narrow loss and improve their free-throw shooting. They will also prepare for a home game against FAU on December 7.\nBottom LineThis game highlighted both Ellerbee's remarkable talent and FGCU's need for improvement in critical moments, particularly in free-throw situations, if they hope to secure victories moving forward.\nRead more at FGCU Athletics\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
