  "text": "Korean sports reality shows are witnessing a surge in popularity as they focus on the authentic drama of intense competition and athletic growth and move away from celebrity-driven entertainment shows.\nThe current trend is to feature professional athletes as protagonists, moving past formats that relied on non-athletic celebrities playing sports for laughs. By showcasing the players' genuine efforts and real stories, the programs give viewers an experience as real and intense as watching a professional match.\nLeading this trend is Channel A’s new series “Baseball Queen,” which premiered Tuesday. It offers a refreshing pivot from recent baseball-centered shows such as JTBC’s \"A Clean Sweep\" and \"Burn to Win,” which mainly focused on the rivalry between retired male baseball legends and had begun to lose steam due to similar formats and narrative arcs.\nInstead, “Baseball Queen” differentiates itself by casting top-tier female athletes from other fields who are taking on the challenge for baseball for the first time.\nThe show’s premiere recorded a peak minute-by-minute viewership rating of 2.2 percent, according to Nielsen Korea, a strong start signaling a positive reception. The baseball team, named Black Queens, is led by two titans of Korean sports history — golf legend Pak Se-ri as general manager and former MLB player Choo Shin-soo as manager.\nThe cast features sports stars such as former national handball team captain Kim On-a and track and field star Kim Min-ji. Viewers have responded enthusiastically to the concept, charmed by watching players step outside their specialties, struggle with unfamiliar skills and learn the complex mechanics of baseball.\n\"Watching athletes from other fields approach baseball with such sincerity is compelling,” one viewer commented online. \"The program feels fresh because it highlights elite athletes seriously tackling baseball,\" one viewer commented online.\nProducer Shin Jae-ho explained that the show aims to highlight the athlete's potential and fighting spirit in a sport that requires high technical skill.\n\"We started this project because we believed the energy of female athletes trying their hand at a new sport would be powerful,\" Shin said during a press conference for the show, Tuesday.\nHe explained that because baseball is difficult to master, the production team sought to highlight the process of these athletes, who had already proven themselves in their respective fields, learning the new sport.\n\"I thought the sport of baseball was extremely challenging,\" Shin said. \"In football or basketball, even if a team lacks skill, the game ends because there is a time limit. However, baseball requires so much technique and is so difficult that a game might not end even if you play all day.\"\nWhile \"Baseball Queen” is just beginning its inning, MBC’s “The Wonder Coach,” featuring volleyball legend Kim Yeon-koung, recently concluded with a flourish, proving the genre’s staying power.\nThe show wrapped up its nine-episode journey on Nov. 23, recording a nationwide viewership rating of 5.8 percent for its finale.\nThe show featured the former volleyball player Kim taking on the role of a rookie director for an underdog team, Wonder Dogs. In the dramatic final episode, the team achieved a shutout victory against the Incheon Heungkuk Life Pink Spiders, a professional championship team and Kim's former club.\nThe finale of \"The Wonder Coach\" left viewers hanging, as it did not clearly confirm if there will be a second season. Although the production team has remained silent, the show's high ratings and strong online interest prove that audiences are hungry for unscripted sports drama.",
