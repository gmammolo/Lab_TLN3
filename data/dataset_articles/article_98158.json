  "text": "Grand Rapids Gators junior Lydia Slagel went two steps up the medal stand Friday, Nov. 21.\nSlagel finished as the state runner-up at the MHSAA Lower Peninsula Division 1 Girls’ Swimming and Diving Finals hosted by Oakland University in Rochester improving on a fourth place finish from her sophomore season at the finals.\nSlagel was in third place following Thursday evening’s prelim’s and semifinals, and then with successes on some tougher dives late in the competition she moved up into second place.\nKalamazoo Central senior Kiya Bowman made sure no one was catching her after she came out of Thursday’s semifinals with the lead. She won the state championship with an overall 11-dive score of 422.60 points. Slagel closed the meet with a score of 389.80.\nBoth girls were really outstanding right from the start. Slagel had the lead after the first three dives, even with Bowman earning a stellar 50.60 points on her back 1 ½ somersault dive in the pike position in round two. Slagel scored more than 40 points on three of her first four dives of the competition.\nSlagel performed a strong dive 403C in round four, an inward 1 ½ somersault dive in the tuck position, that earned her 41.80 points. Bowman had the same dive in the round and tallied a total score of 44.00 points to move into the lead. Bowman led the rest of the competition.\n“She really hit everything,” Slagel said of Bowman, “and she put together a spectacular meet.”\n“I was really just going for second or third. That is what I came here to do, and I did it,” Slagel added.\nIt was third place for Slagel after the five preliminary dives, and she was still in third at the conclusion of round eight, the end of the semifinals. She moved into second with her forward two somersault dive in the pike position in round ten and then held that spot through the end with strong inward dive in the pike position in round 11 that was judged one of her top dives of the meet.\n“Really, I’m happy with all of them,” Slagel said of her state finals dives. “Everything [was better than at regionals], I put in the work and I fixed things, and I made things work better than what they were.”\nShe said most of that work happened on the board – better approaches and a better mindset.\nSlagel said she’ll start working on bigger and better things soon in hopes of moving up the medal stand at the state finals again as a senior. There isn’t too much to do, possibly swap some tuck position dives for pike position dives which have a higher degree of difficulty.\nShe plans to be a manger for the boys’ co-op this winter and to spend some time working with those guys. The Grand Rapids Gators girls’ team is a co-op with Thornapple Kellogg, West Michigan Aviation, West Catholic and Hopkins. The boys’ team, the Grand Rapids Gars, combines Thornapple Kellogg, Hopkins, Unity Christian, West Michigan Aviation Academy and West Catholic.\nOver the years, Slagel has trained and competed in the Hastings Community Diving Club, and club coach Francesca Pileci has coached the Gators’ divers this fall.\n“She does everything,” Slagel said. “She is the best person. I come into practice every day and she is just right there ready to go. She is always there saying you’re going to do great, you’ve got this. I’ll be there standing behind the board and I’ll look over and I just see her big smile. It just helps me to know that I am okay and all this work we have put in is here to pay off. We’re going to do great.\n“She has always just been there for me. Let me tell you, I have some rough days and she is just like, ‘girl you’re going to be fine,’ and we make it through. She’s my deck mom. I love her like a mom.”\nThe top 16 in each event at the state finals earned medals. Slagel was the only diver among the top six scorers who was not a senior.\nSlagel’s 17 points put the Gator program in 24th-place in the overall final team standings. Unsurprisingly, Ann Arbor Pioneer won the MHSAA L.P. Division 1 team championship with 404 points. Jenison was a distant second with 249 points ahead of Northville 193, Zeeland 179, Canton 109, Brighton 108, Rockford 89 and Caledonia 79 in the top ten.\nPioneer girls won six of the meet’s 12 events and West Bloomfield senior Elizabeth Eichbrect was an individual stand-out with state championships in the freestyle distance races. She set state finals records in the 200-yard freestyle and 500-yard freestyle races Thursday and then took state championships in both events Friday. She set the record in the 200 freestyle at 1 minute 45.05 seconds in the prelim’s and then won with a time of 1:45.98. in the 500 freestyle, she set a record in the prelim’s at 4:42.00 and then won the championship in 4:42.89.\nPioneer sophomore Tallulah Beg was the only other girl to win two individual events. She took the 100-yard breaststroke in 1:03.42 and the 200-yard individual medley in 2:04.15. Beg was also a part of Pioneer’s winning 200-yard medley relay team.\nFreshman Kia Alert was a part of the Pioneer 200-yard medley relay and 200- yard freestyle relay wins, and she won the 50-yard freestyle in 22.91. Senior teammate Katelyn Van Ryn won the 100- yard freestyle in 49.94 and was a part of the 200-yard freestyle relay and 400-yard freestyle relay wins for the Pioneer squad.\nThe Gators compete in the OK Conference East Division, and the East Division champions from Caledonia this season were tenth as a team led by senior Sophie Gaylord who has plans to swim collegiately for Oakland University next season. Gaylord she placed fifth in the 50-yard freestyle in 23.45 and third in the 100-yard freestyle in 51.42, and she was a part of the Fighting Scots’ fifth-place 200- yard medley relay team and ninth-place 200-yard freestyle relay team.\nJunior Fighting Scot Mya VanderZwaag was 15th in the 50 freestyle in 25.14, 16th in the 100-yard breaststroke in 1:08.32 and a part of both of those medal winning relay teams for Caledonia.",
