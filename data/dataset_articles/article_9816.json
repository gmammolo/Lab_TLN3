  "text": "St. Joseph family starting over after apartment fire\nST. JOSEPH, Mo. (News-Press NOW) -- Two days after moving into their apartment at The Meadows, a St. Joseph family is starting from scratch following a fire that left them with nothing.\nAn early Tuesday morning blaze at The Meadows Apartment complex displaced dozens of individuals and families. While no injuries were reported, a local family of five, who had just moved in two days prior, suffered the most damage.\n\"We were homeless and I was staying with my aunt until I found The Meadows,\" said Rakisha Hughes, a tenant at The Meadows Apartments. \"She's only in a one-bedroom apartment and was letting me and my four kids live there. So when this happened, it was tragic to know we'd have to start all over again...\"\nFire officials told News-Press NOW that the blaze was unexpected and one of the most significant they've responded to in recent weeks.\nHughes was able to react quickly to the spreading fire thanks to her 16-year-old daughter, who was awake at the time, and immediately began waking up everyone else in the home.\nHughes said she and her family didn't have much to begin with and now they've been stripped of everything, including her computer setup that she used to work from home.\n\"I was next door to where it started so we have nothing,\" Hughes said. \"There's absolutely nothing saved and I still remember the night so vividly. There were a bunch of fire trucks outside and police officers knocking on doors trying to get people up. So, my kids and I started helping them because it was 3 a.m. and almost no one was awake.\"\nAlong with having nothing left, like others who were displaced, Hughes' family is still uncertain about what's next, now staying in temporary housing.\n\"We're being reminded every day that this is temporary and it's not really a shelter,\" Hughes said. \"The Red Cross is more just support. So, I don't know what's going to happen from here.\"\nMeanwhile, Hughes says her family remains hopeful and is grateful for the outpouring of support from local organizations and people within the community.\n\"I'm not good with asking for things but I do appreciate everything,\" Hughes said. \"Even just the prayers for us because this is hard on us. The Red Cross is doing all they can to help us -- feeding us breakfast, lunch and dinner -- but now being homeless and temporarily jobless with four kids, I've got to figure it out.\"\nAccording to a social media post via Facebook, the clothing sizes for Hughes' four children include 2T, 11/12 in boys' clothing, small in women's and an XL in women’s.\nCommunity members can also refer to the original Facebook post here to reach out on ways to help.",
