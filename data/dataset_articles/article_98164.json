  "text": "The director-general of the National Sports Commission (NSC), Hon. Bukola Olopade, has expressed the commission’s commitment to developing a sports sector that reflects Nigeria’s greatness, aligning with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s Renewed Hope agenda.\nOlapade shared this vision during his opening remarks at the ongoing 2nd National Council of Sports (NCS) in Calabar, Cross River State. He emphasised that the technical session is crucial for laying the groundwork for decisions and recommendations that will shape the future of sports development in Nigeria.\nHe urged state directors of sports to leverage their expertise, dedication, and commitment, which he deemed essential for achieving the NSC’s objectives under the Renewed Hope agenda.\n“The Renewed Hope agenda prioritises youth development, job creation, social cohesion, and national pride, all of which are significantly expressed through sports,” he stated.\nIn line with this vision, the NSC has been implementing the Renewed Hope Initiative for Nigeria’s Sports Economy (RHINSE) framework, which focuses on reforms in governance, athlete welfare, infrastructure enhancement, and sports commercialisation.\nOlapade noted that the past year has seen remarkable achievements in sports, highlighting athletes’ inspiring victories on both continental and global stages, advancements in grassroots sports, refurbishment of key facilities, renewed partnerships with the private sector, and improved talent identification and athlete development pathways.\nHe also encouraged participants to recognise that their contributions would strengthen key policy directions for 2025, including sports for economic growth, national unity, diplomacy, and community integration.\nIn her welcome address, Cross River State’s Commissioner for Sports Development, Hon. Agnes Atsu, remarked that the theme of the council meeting—”The Business of Sports: Creating Jobs, Wealth, and Utility under the Renewed Hope Agenda”—aligns with the aspirations for sports development in both Cross River State and Nigeria as a whole.\nShe revealed that the state government is collaborating with private companies to develop sports infrastructure and support athletes, asserting that Cross River is keen to make a meaningful contribution through sports, focusing on job creation, youth empowerment, and community well-being, which are central to Nigeria’s Renewed Hope Agenda, while also addressing crime, hooliganism, and cultism.\nThe council, the highest policymaking body for sports in Nigeria, is expected to conclude its sessions on Saturday.",
