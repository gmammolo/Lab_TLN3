  "text": "Moose Score Four Times in Second, Top Belleville\nPublished on November 27, 2025 under American Hockey League (AHL)\nManitoba Moose News Release\nThe Manitoba Moose (10-7-2-0) got back in the win column on Wednesday night, scoring a 5-1 victory over the Belleville Senators (10-8-2-0) at Canada Life Centre. The Moose fell 5-2 to the Senators in their School Day Game on Tuesday morning.\nThe first period was a quiet one for both offences. Domenic DiVincentiis was the busier of the two goaltenders in the opening 20, stopping 11 Belleville offerings. Each team had a chance on the power play. Carter Yakemchuk paced both teams with four shots on goal from the Senators' blueline.\nManitoba seized control of the game in the second, outshooting Belleville 21-4. Mason Shaw put the Moose on the board 1:54 into the frame, finishing off a rebound. Midway through the period, Shaw banked a pass off the post to Jaret Anderson-Dolan in the slot. Anderson-Dolan made no mistake, firing his third of the season past the pad of Parsons. Manitoba wasn't done there. Brad Lambert scored his first goal of the season on a five-on-three advantage, before Samuel Fagemo scored another power play marker 19 seconds later, giving the Moose a 4-0 lead. DiVincentiis stopped all four shots he faced. David Gustafsson picked up a pair of helpers in the frame.\nBelleville scored 56 seconds into the third. Olle Lycksell fired a rocket over the shoulder of DiVincentiis to break his shutout bid and pull the Senators within three. Fagemo restored Manitoba's four-goal edge with his second goal of the night, scoring the dagger in what was a 5-1 win for the Moose. DiVincentiis stopped 22 shots in his fifth victory of the season, while Parsons fought off 31.\nQuotable\nMoose goaltender Domenic DiVincentiis (click for full interview)\n\"For the most part, I thought we did a solid job from the beginning. I know the shots were different going into the second, but I think we didn't give up too many Grade A opportunities, and I think that's the difference between today and yesterday.\"\nStatbook\nMason Shaw scored two points (1G, 1A) and is on a three-game point streak (1G, 3A)\nDavid Gustafsson registered a pair of assists in his third multi-point game\nJaret Anderson-Dolan has six points (1G, 5A) over his past seven games\nBrad Lambert scored his first goal of the season and has a point in each of his past two games (1G, 1A)\nTyrel Bauer registered an assist for his first point of the season\nPrepared by Frankie Benvenuti\nManitoba Moose Statistics\nAmerican Hockey League Stories from November 27, 2025\n-\nMoose Score Four Times in Second, Top Belleville- Manitoba Moose\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.",
