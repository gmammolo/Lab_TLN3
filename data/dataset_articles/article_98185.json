  "text": "Ads Set Season High with Seven Goals in Win over Iowa\nPublished on November 26, 2025 under American Hockey League (AHL)\nMilwaukee Admirals News Release\nMilwaukee, WI - One game after being held to just one goal, the Admirals offense exploded for a season high seven tallies as they cruised to a 7-2 win over the Iowa Wild in their first meeting of the season on Wednesday night at historic Panther Arena.\nCole O'Hara tallied a pair of goals and dished out an assist for a three-point night, and Tanner Molendyk scored his first professional goal in the contest. Oasiz Wiesblatt, David Edstrom, and Reid Schaefer all finished the game with a goal and an assist, and Jake Lucchini dished out a pair of assists to nab a two-point night as well.\nMatt Murray stopped 34 of the 36 shots he faced to earn his seventh win of the season in a game that saw a combined 94 penalty minutes.\nIt didn't take long for Molendyk to open the scoring as his tally came just 62 seconds after the opening puck drop. After Wiesblatt gained the Iowa zone he fired the puck to the slot where Daniel Carr tipped the puck backwards to a trailing Molendyk and he beat Iowa goalie Cal Peterson over the shoulder for a 1-0 lead.\nIowa responded 2:02 later as Michael Milne scored his first of the season to tie the game at one.\nHowever, Wiesblatt's persistence in front of the Wild net paid off with just 14 seconds to go in the first as he finally shoveled the puck past the pads of Peterson to put the Ads up by a goal heading into the intermission.\nJoakim Kemell gave the Ads some insurance with his second of the season at the 5:26 mark of the second. After a Edstrom face-off-win, Kemell grabbed the puck at the top of the left circle and sent a snapshot over Peterson's left shoulder.\nEdstrom would push the Milwaukee lead to 4-1 when a Kyle Marino shot deflected off his shoulder and into the net with 53 seconds left in the sandwich frame.\nO'Hara scored twice in the third and Shaefer also lit the lamp to give a 7-1 advantage on their way to the victory.\nThe Admirals will be off on Thanksgiving before beginning a home-and-home set with the IceHogs on Friday night at 7 pm in Rockford. The two teams will head back to Milwaukee for game two on Saturday night at 6 pm at historic Panther Arena.\nMilwaukee Admirals Statistics\nAmerican Hockey League Stories from November 26, 2025\n-\nAds Set Season High with Seven Goals in Win over Iowa- Milwaukee Admirals -\nMilwaukee Hands Iowa 7-2 Defeat- Iowa Wild -\nPenguins Power Past Bears, 6-3- Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins -\nGriffins Outlast Stars in Back-And-Forth Affair- Texas Stars -\nSenators Finish Road Trip with 5-1 Loss to Moose- Belleville Senators -\nBears Open Homestand with 6-3 Loss to Penguins- Hershey Bears -\nWolves Throttle IceHogs 8-4 to Snap 3-Game Skid- Chicago Wolves -\nMonsters Serve up 3-1 Victory against Americans- Cleveland Monsters -\nSyracuse Crunch Defeat Utica Comets, 5-3- Syracuse Crunch -\nWolf Pack Lose 6-3 to Thunderbirds- Hartford Wolf Pack -\nT-Birds' Offense Erupts to Topple Wolf Pack, 6-3- Springfield Thunderbirds -\nComets Fall in Feisty Affair to Crunch, 5-3- Utica Comets -\nLysell, Dipietro Lead P-Bruins Past Marlies- Providence Bruins -\nAnaheim Ducks Recall Ville Husso from San Diego- San Diego Gulls -\nBoulton and Sevigny to Reading- Lehigh Valley Phantoms -\nCheckers Partner with WCCB Charlotte for Seven TV Games- Charlotte Checkers -\nHow the West Was Won Show at Acrisure Arena Postponed to February 14, 2026- Coachella Valley Firebirds -\nNew York Rangers Assign F Juuso Pärssinen to Wolf Pack, Recall D Connor Mackey- Hartford Wolf Pack -\nCapitals Recall Bogdan Trineyev from Hershey- Hershey Bears -\nBears Recall Goaltender Seth Eisele- Hershey Bears -\nBay of Quinte Students Shake CAA Arena During Belleville Sens Inaugural School Day Game- Belleville Senators -\nGriffins to Host Winning Wednesday- Grand Rapids Griffins -\nGame Preview: Bears vs. Penguins, 7 p.m.- Hershey Bears -\nOnyebuchi Scores in 200th AHL Game, But Tucson Falls 5-2- Tucson Roadrunners -\nTralmaks and Shine Record Hat Tricks in Griffins' Victory over Texas- Grand Rapids Griffins\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.",
