Ellerbee scored 42 points on 13-for-18 shooting from the field, 5-for-8 shooting from 3-point range and 11-for-14 at the free throw line. The 42 points is second in FGCU history only to Tavian Dunn-Martin, who scored 43 in an overtime road win at Liberty in 2022. 42 points is both the Alico Arena record and the GEICO Coconut Hoops tournament record for points in a game. His 13 made field goals tied Dunn-Martin, who took ten more shots and seven more 3-pointers than Ellerbee to finish with one more point, making Ellerbee's game the most efficient scoring performance by a FGCU player ever. It's the second 40+ point game in FGCU history and the 19th 30+ point game in the Eagle's Division I era. After closing out the win over Rice on Tuesday, Ellerbee provided all of the Eagles' early offense, scoring the first 15 points for FGCU and 22 of its first 24 after the Owls opened with an 8-0 lead, cutting the deficit to 15-17 by himself. Jack Reddick was Ellerbee's first teammate to score, knocking down a pair of free throws with 10:06 to play in the first half. Ellerbee finished with 27 in the first half on a perfect 8-for-8 from the field and 9-for-9 at the free throw line, which on its own was already the best scoring game by any Eagle this season prior to the start of the second half. In the second period, Rahmir Barno – whose ten points marked his sixth straight game in double-digits, and JR Konieczny, who finished with 28 points, resetting his career high in the process – both got going, along with Ellerbee. The trio combined for 84 of FGCU's 100 points on the night and 30 of the 36 in the second half. 11 FGCU missed free throws in regulation, including seven in the second half, loomed large at the end of the game. Kennesaw State opened an early overtime lead and did not miss a shot in the extra five minutes (4-for-4 from the field, 2-for-2 from beyond the arc, 12-for-12 from the free throw line) 24 hours after the Eagles held Rice without a made field goal in overtime. Simeon Cottle led the Owls to the win with an impressive evening in his own right, scoring 33 points, 11 of which came in overtime. Braedan Lue added 19 and Ramone Neals scored 10 for Kennesaw State. After playing three games in three days, the Eagles have a week off before returning to action next Wednesday, Dec. 3 at FIU.
