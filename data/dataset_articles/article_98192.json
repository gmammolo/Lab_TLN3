  "text": "The Dallas Stars (15-5-4) beat the Seattle Kraken (11-6-6) 3-2 at Climate Pledge Arena on Wednesday night.\nRoope Hintz, Esa Lindell, and Vladislav Kolyachonok scored for the Stars. Casey DeSmith made 26 saves.\nRelated: Stars Weekly: Rantanen, Robo, Special Teams, & Keeping Up With the Avs\nBrandon Montour and Vince Dunn scored for the Kraken. Joey Daccord made 18 saves.\nGame Recap\nHintz opened the scoring at 5:52 of the opening period with a tip-in between the circles off an Alexander Petrovic point shot that beat Daccord through the pads.\nMontour evened the score at 9:06 with his fifth goal of the season. Montour’s shot from the slot was saved by DeSmith and deflected into the right corner, where Montour collected the puck and beat DeSmith from a sharp angle along the goal line.\nLindell scored his third of the season at 6:13 of the second period after his own rebound bounced right to him at the side of the crease to give the Stars a 2-1 lead.\nThe Kraken tied the game just 18 seconds into the final period, thanks to a wrist shot from Dunn from the left circle that beat DeSmith along the ice.\nKolyachonok scored his first as a member of the Stars at 14:16 with a wrist shot from above the left circle that hit off the post and in to give the Stars the 3-2 lead, and ultimately, the win.\nThe Kraken outshot the Stars 28-21 but went 0-for-5 on the power play. The Stars went 0-for-1 with the man advantage.\nUp Next\nThe Stars are back in action on Friday night as they host the Utah Mammoth. The Kraken will host the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday afternoon.",
