  "text": "KERRVILLE, Texas — As search and recovery efforts continue for those missing after the tragic Guadalupe River flooding, a nonprofit made up primarily of veteran operators is making an impact.\nSince they arrived on July 5, a day after the catastrophic and historic flooding that overwhelmed parts of the Texas Hill Country, Heroes for Humanity has assisted in the recovery of 17 people. The organization is made up of former military personnel and first responders who now answer the call when disasters strike.\n\"Austere environment is something that these guys really thrive on,\" said Brian Chrisenberry, the crisis response operator for the group. \"We want to go where others don't.\"\nChrisenberry said as they watched the news of the Central Texas floods unfold, their team was ready to jump into action.\n\"These guys are used to rappelling down mountains and doing all kinds of rescues already. That's been really beneficial here.\"\nOne of the organization's missions is search-and-rescue operations. They've been assisting with the operations of heavy machinery, as well as air operations and water recoveries.\n\"John over here is about to do a deep-water recovery, he’s one of the only people on site that is actually trained to go down an recover underwater,\" Chrisenberry said.\nCadaver dogs have also been an important asset, he added. When they target a spot, sonar is used to pinpoint where they need to search.\nWhile Monday's dive mission didn't yield any recoveries, the 30-man team that makes up Heroes for Humanity assisted in the recoveries of two people on Sunday.\n“He was able to dive down underneath some rubble and locate a mother and child that was underneath a car that was submerged, \" Chrisenberry said.\nOne of the hardest parts of the recovery operations, he says, isn't the physical part of their mission--it's the emotional and spiritual aspects.\n“I’ve had a lot of people come up to me that have lost their children and loved ones and thanked me,\" he said. \"It’s hard to even hear that because they have closure, but we haven’t pulled anybody out alive.”\nThe organization plans to be in Kerr County for as long as it takes and is looking for monetary donations to continue its mission.
