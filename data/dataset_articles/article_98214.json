  "text": "The Grand Rapids Griffins scored three unanswered goals in the third period Wednesday to defeat Texas 6-3 and complete a two-game sweep of the Stars at the H-E-B Center at Cedar Park.\nMichael Brandsegg-Nygard snapped a tie and scored what proved to be the winning goal at 3:59 of the third.\nThe Griffins improved to 14-1-0-1, continuing the best start in franchise history with 29 points in 16 games for an AHL-best .906 points percentage. They have recorded 14 wins over a span of 16 games for the first time since going 17-2 from Nov. 18, 2015, to Jan. 3, 2016.\nGrand Rapids is 7-0-0-1 on the road, where it has outscored opponents 39-19.\nThe Griffins have scored 16 goals in consecutive games for the first time since Jan. 19-23, 2013.\nSheldon Dries, Jakub Rychlovsky and Tyler Angle scored for the Griffins to help them maintain a 3-3 tie through two periods. John Leonard scored his league-leading 13th goal and Dominik Shine netted 10th goal late in the third period, both empty-net tallies, to seal the victory.\nSebastian Cossa, starting on consecutive nights, made 24 saves to improve to 7-1-0-0.",
