  "text": "U.S Gets Dramatic 'Super' OT Goal to Win 2025 Prospects Challenge: Puck Drop\nIt was hockey's version of losing the battle, but winning the war in dramatic fashion on Wednesday night.\nAfter Canada scored a power-play goal in the final minutes to even up the CHL-USA Prospects Challenge with a 4-3 victory in Lethbridge, Alberta, a subsequent 3-on-3 \"super overtime\" was played, with the winner securing the series win. The youngest of the Plante brothers, Victor, ended it by scoring at 5:53 of extra time.\nPlante, who is committed to following his brothers Zam and Max to Minnesota Duluth next year, scored the second goal of the game as well. Boston University commitment Jamie Glance scored on a 5-on-3 power play, and Notre Dame commitment AJ Garcia had the American's first goal on a pass from Wisconsin commitment Lukas Zajic.\nNorth Dakota commitment Luke Carrithers stated and started in goal for the super overtime, as did ZacharyÂ Jonvanovski for Canada. After the U.S won the series opener in Calgary on Tuesday night, Michigan commitment JP Hurlbert, who played for the U.S. side last year, set the tone by scoring just 34 seconds into the game,\nAfter the Americans netted the next three goals, Canada's team captain CalebÂ Malhotra, a Boston University commitment, sparked the comeback with a shorthanded goal just 37 seconds after Glace's goal, and Alessandro Di Iorio tied the game late in the second period.\nThe power-play goal that was the game-winner and tied the series was by Xavier Villeneuve, with assists credited to Carson Carels and Mathis Preston at 16:49 of the third period. That led to the super overtime, with 20 minutes on the clock, and both sides having scoring chances in the opening minutes of extra time.\nThe U.S. lost both games last year in the inaugural matchup of the U.S. National Under-18 Team and the top draft-eligible players that compete in the Canadian Hockey League. Although the Americans won the series opener 4-2, Canada had a sizable edge in combined shots, 81-53 over the two games.\nPuck Drop: Thursday, November 27, 2025\nâ€¢Â USA Hockey unveiled the jerseys that the men, women and paralympic teams will wear for the upcoming 2026 Winter Games in Italy.

I was very lucky to have my sister come to me at the right time to form this. We help other people who are struggling with addiction. In the addiction world, the only thing I have to do to help people is tell the truth. I tell people what happened to me. I got hurt. I got stuck on some things.â€�\n-Â Kevin Stevens (Boston College)",
