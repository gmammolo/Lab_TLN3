  "text": "MANILA, Philippines — The Perpetual Help Altas punched the first ticket in the NCAA Season 101 men’s basketball Final Four after keeping the Jose Rizal University Bombers at bay, 81-74, Thursday at the Mall of Asia Arena.\nThis is Perpetual’s first Final Four appearance since NCAA Season 97, where the Kim Aurin and Jielo Razon-led Altas defeated the Benilde Blazers in the play-off.\nMark Gojo Cruz powered the Altas with 23 points, two rebounds, two assists, two steals and two blocks. Patrick Sleat chipped in 14 markers, 10 dimes and six boards.\nThe two teams were tied at 43-all in the third quarter after a Justin Lozano layup.\nBut Perpetual broke the game wide open with 16 straight points, capped by a split from the line by JP Boral, to grab a 59-43 advantage.\nThe Altas maintained an 11-point edge, 73-62, with 3:13 remaining after a Jearico Nunez jumper.\nBut a massive 8-0 run, capped by a triple by Yuri Duque, sliced the deficit to just three, 70-73, with 1:55 to go.\nHowever, a layup by Sleat, followed by a pair of free throws by John Abis, iced the game.\nShawn Orgo chipped in 10 points for the winning team.\nSean Salvador and Allan Laurenaria had 18 and 16 markers, respectively, in the losing effort. Lozano chipped in 11.\nPerpetual will be taking on either Arellano or Letran in the semifinals.",
