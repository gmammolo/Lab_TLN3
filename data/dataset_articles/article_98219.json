  "text": "The stakes are rising for girls’ basketball at Coxsackie-Athens, and the Riverhawks like it that way.\nLast season was head coach Sarah Wlodarczyk’s best in five years with the program, and she’s ready to take the Riverhawks’ largely intact core from 2024-25 another step closer to their first Patroon Conference title in 30 years.\n“They've been excited to get in the gym,” she said. “I feel like every year that I've been here, we've progressively gotten a little bit better and better, which I'm really happy for … They’re constantly raising the bar for each other and for themselves.”\nCoxsackie-Athens went 13-1 in the Patroon and 19-4 overall last year, winning its first 14 games and reaching the Section 2 Class B semifinals, an improvement from a 16-5 finish in the 2023-24 season, which followed up a 12-win campaign a year earlier.\nMemory is a motivator for the Riverhawks, who only trailed Catskill in last season’s race for a conference banner. The Cats ended Coxsackie-Athens’ undefeated start in late January, beating the Riverhawks 61-48. It’s a result which will likely carry energy into a Dec. 19 rematch, the first of two contests between both teams this season.\n“We have a lot of motivation,” senior Baileigh Briski said. “We want to get back at Catskill.”\nWhile four seniors graduated from the program in June, Briski leads a group of five this season, and is one of four returning starters. She’s a historic flag-bearer for the program too. Having averaged 21.8 points per game last season, she surpassed both the girls’ career scoring record previously held by 2001 graduate Tina Nestlen, as well as the boys’ record belonging to 1957 graduate Bill Stafford, who totaled 1,257 career points at the school. Briski wants to uphold a precedent of doing the unprecedented, both at a personal and team level.\n“My individual goal may be hitting 2,000 [points], but I want to win the conference,” she said. “All I want to do is win.”\nCurrently sitting about 600 points away from the 2,000 mark, her success has earned offers from schools such as SUNY Cobleskill, William Paterson and Saint Joseph’s in Brooklyn. Wlodarczyk thinks Briski’s reputation precedes her both in Coxsackie-Athens’ home gym and around the Patroon.\n“The fact that she's already a senior, it's kind of crazy,” Wlodarczyk said. “I feel like she's been around for a while, and I'm sure other teams in the league have probably been counting down the days too.”\n“She's tremendous, and the amount of work that she has put in this offseason, in terms of just getting into the gym, not just from a basketball standpoint, but weight training … She's been lifting consistently, and it's a testament to her drive. She doesn't have to be to school until 9:30 every day, and she's at the [YMCA] before 7 a.m. getting her lifts in before she comes to school.”\nCoxsackie-Athens’ lone departing starter at the end of last year was point guard Julia Grounds, a personnel opening Wlodarczyk thinks the roster is ready to address.\n“We've got a lot of guards that came up from JV, whereas most of our senior class fulfilled the forward spot, so it's just a shift really in [who’s] coming off the bench and how to best utilize them,” she said.\nSenior Camryn Slater brings experience to the forward spot, and she looks to help replicate the team’s areas of success from last season, where they averaged a Class B-best 62 points per game while allowing just 38 per night.\n“I think I want to carry on what we already have so far, working together as a team, creating the right passes and good opportunities for our teammates,” she said.\nAlongside the excitement of rematching Catskill, Wlodarczyk is looking forward to her team’s early non-league competition, such as Ravena-Coeymans-Selkirk on Dec. 3 in their season opener, as well as Johnstown on Dec. 5 and Class AAA opponent Guilderland on Dec. 10.\n“It's a testament to our quality of play and getting that mutual respect from other coaches and having other teams be willing to play us,” she said. “We do a lot of fighting down here in the Patroon, I know all the coaches would probably say the same thing. There's a lot of really good basketball happening here.”",
