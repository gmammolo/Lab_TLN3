  "text": "By Kane McGuire, Louisiana Tech Associate Athletic Director/Strategic Communications and Digital Marketing; featured photo by Josh McDaniel\nRUSTON –DJ Dudley capped a wild finish with a game-winning jumper with 1.4 seconds left as Louisiana Tech knocked off Indiana State, 75–73, on Wednesday night inside the Thomas Assembly Center on Karl Malone Court.\nOne week ago in Terre Haute, Indiana, LA Tech (3-2) and Indiana State (4-3) could barely score the basketball. Tonight was much different as the Bulldogs and Sycamores traded offensive blows, especially in the second half.\nISU made 10 of its last 11 field goals, the last one being a corner three-pointer by Camp Wagner to tie the contest up for the fifth time at 73-73. With 23 ticks remaining, LA Tech held for the last shot. Dudley got the switch on the Sycamore’s center and went one-on-one, driving the rock to the basket where he stopped in the paint and sank a 4-foot floater.\nFollowing a stoppage in play to check the clock, the ‘Dogs were able to intercept the long pass by the Sycamores, not allowing a shot to get revenge from last week’s loss.\nThe offensive struggles continued for LA Tech to start the game, trailing 25-18 with 6:33 remaining in the first half. However, things began to click on both ends of the floor for the Bulldogs, which resulted in a 19-1 run to close out the half and give the home team a 37-26 advantage.\nFour different Bulldogs scored during the run, including AJ Bates who tallied six of his 16 points within the stretch including an off-balance floater to beat the buzzer and end the stanza.\nThe lead was erased within the first five minutes of the second half as Indiana State opened the frame on a 14-3 run to tie things up at 40-40.\nThe Sycamores never regained the lead though as the Bulldogs stretched its advantage out to double figures again at 61-51 following a driving layup by Bates. A quick 6-0 run though by the Sycamores later on got the deficit back down to one possession at 65-63 with 2:51 still to go.\nIt was counter punch after counter punch from then on out.\nDudley sank a deep jumper to put the ‘Dogs back up four. Then the Sycamores scored. Then Sir Issac Herron connected on a made layup through contact. Then the Sycamores scored again. Then an offensive rebound by Kaden Cooper led to a made layup by Scooter Williams.\nIndiana State responded again with a made layup off a turnover. Next was Dudley calmly sinking two free throws to give LA Tech a 73-70 edge. And then calmly called game after the Sycamores tied it with a three.\nAfter neither team shot over 35 percent from the field seven days ago, LA Tech shot 51.6 percent and Indiana State shot 52.7 percent. The Bulldog bench was big, scoring 55 of the team’s 75 points. Dudley scored a season-high 17 after playing in just four minutes last game. Herron netted 10 points after not playing in the first matchup against the Sycamores. Bates (16), Scooter Williams (12), and Cooper (10) also reached double-digit points. Cooper added a game-high 11 rebounds for a double-double, helping LA Tech generate a +10-rebounding margin.\nQUOTABLES\nHead coach Talvin Hester\nOn the win…\n“I’ll give this win to our attitudes. When you look at this game, we had two guys that did not really play the last time we faced them. Usually, guys in those situations sulk or are down, but [DJ Dudley and Sir Issac Herron] had an unbelievable week of practice. They really fought for what they wanted, and that changed us today. They were a huge reason we won tonight. I was very proud of them. And just being locked in and confident.”\nOn keeping pace with Indiana State’s offense in the second half…\n“I figured Indiana State would get back into the game with the way they score it. I found a lineup that I really liked. Kaden Cooper was playing well tonight, rebounding and doing some good things defensively. I just needed to roll with those guys and simplify the game plan for them.”\nOn the final possession…\n“I have always known DJ can score the basketball. I had to help him get confidence. Late in the game when it came time for the last shot, I knew I was going to get him the ball and live with whatever shot he was going to take.”\nGuard AJ Bates\nOn the offense…\n“I think it was our attitude. We have still been trying to feel each other out and see where the offense goes. Tonight, we showed as a team when we share the ball and run the floor, great things happen.”\nGuard DJ Dudley\nOn operating on offense…\n“On that last play, once they switched, I knew I did not want to settle for a jump shot. I wanted to get downhill. If I had the open layup take it. I did and I took it.”\nNOTABLES\n- With the win, the series is now tied with Louisiana Tech and Indiana State, 2-2.\n- LA Tech registered its 1,497th victory in program history.\n- LA Tech claimed its 13th straight victory in a multi-team event and is now 35-5 in MTE contests dating back to 2012.\n- LA Tech improved to 17-0 in home games played as part of non-conference MTEs.\n- The Bulldogs are now 3-0 at home this season and 214-22 all-time in non-conference games inside the Thomas Assembly Center.\n- The Bulldogs had five players score in double figures, the most in a single game this season (most since March 1, 2025, at Sam Houston).\n- LA Tech used its third different starting lineup in five games this season.\n- LA Tech cracked 50 percent shooting from the field for the second time this season, going 33-of-64 (51.6 percent) from the floor.\n- LA Tech registered 55 bench points, the most in a single game this season (most since scoring 67 against Dillard on Nov. 25, 2023).
