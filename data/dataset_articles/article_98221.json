  "text": "SACRAMENTO – The Phoenix Suns spread the ball around and beat the Kings in a total team effort, and are undefeated in NBA Cup Play after a 112-110 win over the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night.\nFrom the opening tip, the Suns played like a team that understands what an early-season tournament can mean in April. Phoenix blistered Sacramento with a first-half shooting burst, spacing the floor, attacking mismatches, and playing with rhythm instead of rush. The Kings tried to match pace, but the Suns dictated it. This is the version of Phoenix fans have been waiting for, the one that doesn’t waste early momentum and doesn’t let opponents breathe.\nDevin Booker wasn’t just scoring; he was sculpting the night. He finished with 19 points and 6 assists, reading Sacramento’s coverages like he’d downloaded their entire defensive playbook. Mark Williams looked strong under the rim, Collin Gillespie is letting the game come to him while executing, and Jamaree Bouyea was earning his spot and hitting his shots when it mattered. Bouyea had a huge night for the Suns, shooting 4-for-6 for 11 points. When the game threatened to get chaotic, Phoenix was able to slow it down.\nGoing 3–0 in NBA Cup play isn’t just a line in the standings; it’s a signal. Phoenix is figuring out its habits early, learning how to start strong and come out on top even after a little struggle in the third quarter. If the Suns keep pairing efficient offense with turnover discipline, they’re not just tournament threats; they’re building the identity that could define their season.\nMore must-reads:\nGet the latest news and rumors, customized to your favorite sports and teams.
