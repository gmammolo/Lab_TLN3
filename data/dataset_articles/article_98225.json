The second period saw some scrums and newly acquired Tyrone Bronte finding the net, bringing it to 2-0. Andrew Poulias extended the lead to 3-0, Shane Bull made it 4-0, and Blake Wells capped off the Ice Flyers' second-period scoring to make it 5-0. Huntsville's Connor Fries scored the lone goal for the Havoc at the tail end of the period.\nThe third period continued the excitement with Nicholas Aromatario finding the back of the net, Zack Bross extending the lead to 7-1, and Sam Rhodes capping off the night with his 6th goal of the season to seal the 8-1 win.\nThe Ice Flyers are back at the Hangar on Saturday night for Blue Angels Night presented by Step One Automotive Buick GMC Pensacola.\nFans can bid on the autographed goal pucks from tonight on DASH.\nScoring Summary\nFirst Period\nHSV 0, PEN 1\n14:41 Tyler German (6) - Wells, Poellinger\nShots on goal: HSV 7, PEN 14\nSecond Period\nHSV 0, PEN 2\n2:33 (PP) Tyrone Bronte (2) - Unassisted\nHSV 0, PEN 3\n3:37 (PP) Andrew Poulias (2) - Mastrangeli, Burnie\nHSV 0, PEN 4\n5:06 Shane Bull (6) - Jirousek, Poellinger\nHSV 0, PEN 5\n5:38 Blake Wells (4) - Bronte, Burnie\nHSV 1, PEN 5\n18:34 (PP) Connor Fries (6) - McCabe, Galloway\nShots on goal: HSV 13, PEN 9\nThird Period\nHSV 1, PEN 6\n7:10 Nicholas Aromatario (2) - Gaudette\nHSV 1, PEN 7\n17:29 Zack Bross (2) - Jones\nHSV 1, PEN 8\n18:48 Sam Rhodes (6) - Bull, Aromatario\nShots on goal: HSV 6, PEN 6\nTotal shots on goal: HSV 26, PEN 29\nPensacola Ice Flyers Statistics\nSPHL Stories from November 26, 2025\n-\nKent Scores Twice, Fatbacks Extend Win Streak to Three- Fayetteville Marksmen -\nCold Night for Havoc in Decisive Road Loss to Ice Flyers- Huntsville Havoc -\nIce Flyers Blow away Huntsville- Pensacola Ice Flyers -\nThunderbolts Rally from 3-Goal Deficit, Earn Point in Shootout Loss- Evansville Thunderbolts -\nMacon Pulls out Gutsy SO Win over Evansville- Macon Mayhem -\nRivermen Come from Behind to Down Storm 3-2- Peoria Rivermen -\nDawgs Rally Late from Big Deficit, Lose 7-4 to Knoxville- Roanoke Rail Yard Dawgs -\nIce Bears Crush Rail Yard Dawgs with Massive Second Period- Knoxville Ice Bears -\nGame Preview: November 26 vs Huntsville- Pensacola Ice Flyers -\nPeoria Travels to Quad City on Wednesday Before Hosting Evansville this Weekend- Peoria Rivermen -\nKyle Soper Returns; Button Activated Ahead of Three-Game Week- Knoxville Ice Bears\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.",
