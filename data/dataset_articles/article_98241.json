However, he further showed confidence in executing a more impressive performance with the recovery. He also updated on his shoulder injury.\nAd “The leg will never be 100 percent, no,” Kilde said. “It is like crashing a car and taking it to the people who can fix it, it will never be the same car again. But you can still make the car super fast.” “The shoulder is limited in movement,” Kilde said. “When you ski, the move you do is always forward. And if you can’t lift your arms forwards, you are pretty much (done for),\" he added. \"It’s incredible how the body adapts, which is one of the reasons I see myself skiing again. Because I know I am capable of adapting.” (via apnews.com ) Days after suffering from injuries, Aleksander Kilde also contracted sepsis, which forced him to undergo surgeries in Austria in August 2024 and in February 2025.\n× Feedback Why did you not like this content?
