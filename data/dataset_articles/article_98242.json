  "text": "Rockets (12-4) rally past Warriors as Reed Sheppard scores career high Story by\nBen DuBose, Rockets Wire Thu, November 27, 2025 at 6:12 AM UTC · 3 min read\nFacing a 14-point road deficit and missing several rotation players, the Rockets still rallied back in Wednesday’s 104-100 victory ( box score ) at Golden State. Houston (12-4) has now won 12 of its last 14 games, overall.\nIt was technically an Emirates NBA Cup 2025 matchup, though both the Rockets (12-4, 2-2) and Warriors (10-10, 1-3) were eliminated from knockout-round contention earlier in the evening . Nonetheless, it was a heated battle between 2025 Western Conference playoff foes that could become quite meaningful in the standings race.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Second-year guard Reed Sheppard was the clear headliner for the Rockets, finishing with a career-high 31 points, 9 rebounds, and 5 assists while making 12-of-25 shots (48.0%) and four 3-pointers. He also hit a pair of clinching free throws in the final seconds to put the game away.\n“He was big,” Rockets head coach Ime Udoka said of Sheppard. “Reed really held us together when guys were struggling.”\nOther key statistics included:\nAlperen Sengun: 16 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists; 7-of-18 shooting (38.9%)\nAmen Thompson: 10 points, 14 rebounds, 3 assists; 4-of-12 shooting (33.3%)\nJabari Smith Jr.: 15 points, 4 rebounds, 4-of-11 shooting (36.4%), 2-of-5 on 3-pointers (40.0%), 5-of-7 on free throws (71.4%)\nAaron Holiday: 14 points, 3 assists; 4-of-16 shooting (25.0%), 3-of-11 on 3-pointers (27.3%)\nClint Capela: 6 points, 12 rebounds (8 offensive); 3-of-8 shooting (37.5%)\nJimmy Butler (Warriors): 21 points, 5 rebounds, 5 assists; 6-of-11 shooting (54.5%), 2-of-4 on 3-pointers (50.0%), 7-of-7 on free throws\nSteph Curry (Warriors): 14 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists, 6 turnovers; 4-of-13 shooting (30.8%), 2-of-9 on 3-pointers (22.2%)\nDraymond Green (Warriors): 12 points, 8 assists, 8 rebounds, 2 blocks; 5-of-8 shooting (62.5%), 2-of-5 on 3-pointers (40.0%)\nDespite shooting just 39.4% overall and 28.2% from 3-point range, Houston still found a way to win. Defense and rebounding were key variables, as the Rockets won the rebounding battle, 66-54, and held Golden State to just 2-of-21 shooting from 3-point range in the second half (9.5%).\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Rockets were severely short-handed, with Kevin Durant ( personal reasons ), Steven Adams (right ankle tendinopathy), and Tari Eason ( right oblique strain ) among the latest losses. Adams is considered day to day, while Durant will likely return by Houston’s next game. Eason is expected to miss at least two more weeks.\nThe Rockets continue to be without veterans Fred VanVleet (right knee) and Dorian Finney-Smith (left ankle), as well, due to offseason surgeries. Neither has a projected return timeline.\nThe Rockets are now midway through a four-game Western Conference road trip, though they have a few days off before resuming it on Sunday afternoon in Utah. Tipoff of that Rockets-Jazz game is at 2:00 p.m. Central, and it will be televised regionally on Space City Home Network and nationally via NBA League Pass.\nMore: ‘Great player’: Dillon Brooks lauds growth of Houston’s Amen Thompson\nThis article originally appeared on Rockets Wire: Rockets (12-4) rally past Warriors as Reed Sheppard scores career high\nAdvertisement Advertisement",
