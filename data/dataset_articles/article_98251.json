  "text": "By Jeff Hathhorn ,\n3 hours ago\nPITTSBURGH (93.7 The Fan) – In a three-way tie for first place in the ACC, the fourth-ranked Panthers women’s volleyball team beat one of those teams, #7 Louisville, 3-0 (25-23, 25-22. 25-22) Wednesday night in front of 7,928 fans at the Petersen Events Center.\nTrailing at the end of the first set, the Panthers went on a 6-0 run to win 25-23, reigning national player of the year Olivia Babcock’s ace clinched the second set 25-22, on a serve originally ruled out and challenged by Pitt. A kill by Babcock, who finished with a match-high 22 kills, ended the match, 25-22 in the third set.\n“I thought we were incredible when it mattered most,” said Pitt head coach Dan Fisher. “I think we were down late in almost every set and found a way to lock in. I’m proud just hanging tough when things weren’t going our way.”\n“I think it’s something we talk about often is just being good after 20,” Babcock said. “I feel like up until we got there we knew we weren’t playing our best volleyball, but we also knew that was the time to flip the switch. It’s really just about how you finish.”\nThe night was obviously big for this team, but just another example of the popularity of the sport in Pittsburgh. Among those front and center and cheering were former Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and his family. Looking deeper into the nearly eight thousand who attended Friday, Pitt students were on break and the Pens were hosting a game at the same time.\n“I think there was a part during the game that we noticed the crowd was really engaged,” said setter Brooke Mosher. “I think seeing that the crowd has our back gives us a lot more fire, especially during those games when we were down a little bit. That gives us that little bit of an edge.”\n“I feel like when we were playing at the end of the set and I feel like that’s when the crowd was giving the most energy,” Babcock said. “I feel like we were able to feed off each other.”\n“All I can say is it means a lot and keep showing up Pittsburgh,” Fisher said. “The sport is growing and as people talk about volleyball nationally, that people talk about the fan support in Pittsburgh is pretty sweet.”\nPanthers have one match left, at Georgia Tech (16-12, 11-8) at 1p on Saturday. The Yellow Jackets lost at Stanford Wednesday night. The Cardinal (26-14, 17-2) host Louisville at 7p on Saturday. A Pitt win guarantees a share of the program’s seventh conference title. A win and Stanford loss means an outright championship.",
