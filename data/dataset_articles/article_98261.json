  "text": "Arsenal secured a dominant 3-1 win over Bayern Munich in the Champions League.\nThe clash against Vincent Kompany’s side was viewed by many as the Gunners’ toughest test of the season, and the first half was pretty even.\nHowever, Arsenal were levels above Bayern after the break, and deservedly won the game 3-1.\nKompany was full of praise for the North Londoners after his side’s defeat.\nWho was Arsenal’s Man of the Match against Bayern Munich?\nVincent Kompany says Arsenal have ‘mastered’ set-pieces\nArsenal have been extremely efficient at set-pieces for a long time now.\nNicolas Jover has transformed the Gunners in that department, and their brilliance troubled Bayern Munich on Wednesday night as well.\nArsenal opened the scoring from a corner. Jurrien Timber headed Bukayo Saka’s ball in perfectly to give his side the lead.\nMikel Arteta’s side only had six corners all game, but they made Bayern struggle every single time.\nKompany, who knows a thing or two about defending set-pieces, was blown away and hailed Arsenal as the masters.\nHe said, as relayed on HaytersTV: “What I want to say is, I’ll give you an example, I don’t know how many goals we’ve scored, 50-60 since the start of August…\n“As difficult as it is to prepare to defend against us, it’s how difficult it is to prepare to defend set-pieces against them.\n“They have got every other aspect of the game as well, but that’s something that they have mastered more than anybody else.”\nIs Jurrien Timber Arsenal’s biggest threat from set-pieces with Gabriel injured?\nArsenal have proven that they are not just a set-piece team\nThere has been a lot of criticism directed towards Arsenal because many of their goals early in the season came from corners or free-kicks.\nArteta and his players never cared about that, but we think they have done enough to convince people that they are not ‘Set Piece FC’.\nYes, Arsenal scored from a corner again against Bayern, but they also scored two great goals from open play. That comes off the back of four open play goals against Tottenham.\nArsenal are the most complete team in Europe. They can do everything and deserve all the credit in the world for being such a great side.",
