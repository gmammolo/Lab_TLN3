  "text": "HOCKEY\nSenior with elevated role gives Howell hockey win over No. 1 Hartland\nBill Khan\nLivingston Daily\nHOWELL — Nolan Firek’s contributions during Howell’s run to a hockey state championship game last season went largely unnoticed outside of the team.\n“Last year it was mostly third line, just not getting scored on, getting pucks out,” Firek said of his role on that team.\nAnd that’s OK. Not everyone can score goals. The little things Firek and others on his line were doing in relative obscurity were part of the mix that resulted in a special season for the Highlanders.",
