  "text": "No. 3 seed Long Beach State women’s volleyball advanced to the Big West Championship semifinals after a resounding sweep of UC Irvine in the first round at the LBS Financial Credit Union Pyramid on Wednesday, Nov. 26.\nThe hosts of the tournament, LBSU held a slight 5-4 early lead off the back of two of the five first set kills from LBSU senior middle blocker Rhiann Sheffie.\nA 5-0 Beach run spurred by Anteater attack errors and a solo block by senior outside hitter and All-Big West Second Team selection Elise Agi put LBSU ahead 10-5.\nCelebrating their star Canadian opposite hitter, “O Canada” was sung from the LBSU bench as All-Big West First Team selection and redshirt freshman Logan King fired an ace past UCI before a kill by freshman middle blocker Sidney Hamaker capped off a 4-0 Beach run, extending the lead to 16-8.\nThe Anteaters (13-18) found life with a late surge, mustering a late 5-0 run to try to survive the first set, but a kill from senior middle blocker Nieko Thomas sealed set one in The Beach’s favor, 25-18.\nThomas continued to catch fire, as she began the tightly contested second set with three early kills to put LBSU just ahead at 9-8.\n“Our middles have been awesome,” LBSU head coach Natalie Reagan said. “To lean on them in those tough moments means a ton, and it just balances our offense that much more.”\nUCI senior outside hitter and Big-West Honorable Mention Kendra Duffey tied the set at 11 with her second of six second set kills, trying to push UCI towards a set win.\nHowever, Duffey’s push did not have enough force behind it, as attack errors and two Hamaker kills gave The Beach a set controlling 6-0 run to lead 17-11.\nA four-kill set from Agi set up Hamaker for a dagger kill to give LBSU the second set 25-20, taking a commanding two set lead.\nJust one set away from advancing to the Big West Championship semifinals, The Beach found themselves up 13-7 after sophomore setter and All Big-West Second Team selection Madi Maxwell served an ace to finish off a dominant 7-0 run.\nNot ready for their season to end, the Anteaters crawled all the way back with an 8-0 run of their own to take a surprising 18-17 lead, coming by way of strong blocking to force a Beach timeout.\n“In that moment, I was just going back and telling everyone that I was going to be ripping balls, and I know that everyone has my back with that,” Agi said. “I get really excited when I have those pressure moments because I’m like, ‘Okay, this is what I love to do.’”\nAn even split of 14 kills by Agi and King allowed The Beach to punch back, setting them up for set point as a shared block by King and Sheffie sent LBSU into the semifinals 26-24.\nAgi, King and Sheffie all hit double-digit kills, as The Beach continued to defend their home turf, staying undefeated against conference opponents at home.\n“I think our defense and our setting really helped make it easy for me to pick the right shots,” King said.\nWith the win, The Beach are now one step closer to the Big West crown, as they take on the No. 2 seed Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Mustangs (23-7) in the semifinals on Friday, Nov. 28.\n“Cal Poly is a great team, and their offense is hard to stop…but it really just comes down to the serve and pass battle that triggers so much in the game,” Reagan said.",
