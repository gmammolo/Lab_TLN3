  "text": "After finishing second in back-to-back Northern California Golf Association points events, Vinay Ramesh was determined to win the Napa City Championship on Nov. 8-9.\nThe San Francisco resident had played his way onto the leaderboard with second-place finishes in the Aug. 16-17 Antioch City Championship at Lone Tree Golf Course, and the Sept. 6-7 Mountain View City Amateur at Shoreline Golf Links.\n“There's no question I came close in those other two events,” he said. “I really was hungry to kind of try to get a win. That was the goal, for sure.”\nGoal accomplished.\nRamesh fired rounds of 71 and 69 to claim the Napa City Championship at Napa Golf Course at Kennedy Park with a 4-under-par 140 total. The 36-hole NCGA points event was played at the par-72, 6,682-yard championship layout designed by Jack Fleming and Bob Baldock.\nHe went into the final round two shots off the lead. He closed his round with birdies on three of the last five holes, shooting 1-under 35 on the back nine.\n“I think my game was pretty sharp today,” said Ramesh, who played college golf at Princeton University. “Made a few errors here and there, but I think I was mentally tough to kind of bounce back from them. Was shaky (Saturday), but I think I didn't put myself out of the tournament. Much more solid today, for sure.”\nRamesh had birdies on the second, ninth and 14th holes in the first round, and on Nos. 3, 5, 6, 14, 17 and 18 in the second round.\n“I actually had a goal of shooting 5-under today,” said the 28-year-old, a member at Silver Creek Valley Country Club in San Jose. “I've been really wanting to win something pretty bad, and to be able to do it in a wonderful town like Napa is just a cherry on top.\n“It just kind of helps me, like, it's a good step in the right direction, I think, on my journey back to kind of getting better again and playing competitive golf. I think this is a really, really good accomplishment. I’m going to be thinking about this for a while, for sure. It means a lot.”\nRamesh birdied the par-5 14th by driving off the tee, hitting a 5-iron from 190 yards to 15 feet, and two-putting.\n“I think when I hit that second shot, it kind of kicked the round into another gear because I was making birdies already in that round,” he said. “But that's when it kind of like kicked in, when I was like, ‘OK, now we can kind of start pulling away a little bit.’”\nRamesh bounced back after a bogey on the par-3 16th hole.\n“I think that kind of fueled the fire, because 17 and 18 are very gettable holes,” he said, “so I was like, ‘OK, let's take advantage kind of thing.’”\nOn the par-4 17th hole, he hit driver and a lob wedge from 60 yards out and made the birdie putt from 10 feet.\n“That one I needed,” he said. “I really wanted to kind of get one more birdie before the 18th hole, for sure.”\nRamesh hit 3-wood off the tee on the par-5 18th hole. He had 240 yards to the green and hit 3-wood to the right rough, pin-high. He got up and down from just off the green, converting a 15-foot putt for birdie.\n“I had this mental switch where I was like, ‘We're going to finish strong,’ and I just kept like kind of chanting that to myself: ‘Finish strong. Finish strong,’” he said. “Just felt more in control today.”\nRamesh joined Silver Creek Valley in June after not having played any golf in over two years.\n“I joined with like a strong desire to kind of get back into it and play good tournament golf, and so I've been practicing pretty hard at Silver Creek,” he said.\nHe enjoyed playing in the Napa City Championship and spending the weekend in Napa.\n“I would definitely play here again. I really enjoyed the weather. The greens were really receptive. The fairways were pretty firm,” he said.\n“Napa as a town is incredible. I would totally come back.”\nRamesh graduated from Princeton in 2020 with a degree in computer science. He is originally from Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania, and went to Pennsbury High School.\nTaking second place was Treed Huang (74-68 – 142).\nFinishing in third place was John McCord (69-74 – 143).\nIn fourth place was Zhenxian Zhang (69-75 – 144).\nTaking fifth place, in a tiebreaker, was Daniel Robertson (72-73 – 145).\n***\nJim Richerson, a PGA of America past president who was on the staff at Chardonnay Golf Club in American Canyon earlier in his career, was inducted into the PGA of America Hall of Fame with the Class of 2025.\nRicherson, who was the head golf professional of the Vineyards Course and also interim general manager at Chardonnay Golf Club, was honored on Nov. 6 during ceremonies at the 109th PGA Annual Meeting at the Omni PGA Frisco Resort in Frisco, Texas.\nThe PGA of America Hall of Fame, according to a report at pga.com, honors individuals who through their lives, careers, service and support have made significant and enduring contributions to the association in its mission to grow the game of golf.\n\"It’s amazing what you can accomplish when you don’t care who gets the credit,\" Richerson said in the report. \"I think anybody that’s had any type of success in our business has a lot of people that have supported them along the way. From a business standpoint, I’ve had great partners, but it starts and ends with my family. I grew up in a very supportive family.\n\"My parents supported six kids that all went into different industries. And my wife, Kristi, for those who don’t know her, is better than me in every way. She’s the most genuine person I know. You can’t have any success unless you have people supporting you, and I’ve been very fortunate that the little bit of success that I've had is because of such great support.\"\nAlso inducted into the Hall of Fame, the report said, was former LPGA Tour star Nancy Lopez, PGA of America honorary member and adaptive trick-shot artist Dennis Walters, and PGA members Ronny Glanton, Jim McLean and JD Turner.\nLopez was a 48-time LPGA Tour champion and a four-time LPGA Tour Player of the Year. She is in the World Golf Hall of Fame.\nInduction into the PGA of America Hall of Fame “is the highest honor the PGA of America can bestow upon its members and ambassadors of the game,” the report said.\n“The PGA of America Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony is always a special night, and the 2025 Class truly represents the very best of our Association and the game we love,” PGA of America President and Master Professional Don Rea Jr. said in the report. “It's a tremendous honor to celebrate their profound achievements in growing and elevating golf and the industry. Their collective legacy is inspirational.”\nRicherson was elected as the 42nd president of the PGA of America at the 104th PGA Annual Meeting in 2020, and “oversaw record participation and growth of the game, further elevating the role and stature of the PGA of America Golf Professional,” the report said.\nHe enters the Hall of Fame in the PGA of America Past President Category.\nRicherson was at Chardonnay for four years and worked in management and executive positions at golf properties in six states for Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Hotel and Golf Corp. for 18 years, the report said.\nHe led operations as general manager and director of golf for Kohler Co. at Whistling Straits & Blackwolf Run in Wisconsin and The Duke’s Course in St. Andrews, Scotland for over 11 years, the report said.\nHe was honored with the Wisconsin PGA Golf Professional of the Year Award in 2013 and 2016. He was the recipient of the Section’s Professional Development Award in 2011 and the Bill Strausbaugh Award in 2012.\nHe was captain of the victorious U.S. PGA Cup team in 2024.\nRicherson was with Troon, a golf management company, as senior vice president of operations “overseeing day-to-day management of Troon’s expanding portfolio while serving 585-plus locations around the globe,” a report at news.pga.org said.\nHe has been at The Riviera Country Club and The Riviera Tennis Club in Pacific Palisades as general manager and chief operating officer since 2021.\n***\nJared Stone, an assistant golf professional at Silverado Resort, tied for 59th place at the 2025 Assistant PGA Professional Championship Nov. 13-16 at PGA Golf Club (Dye Course) in Port St. Lucie, Florida.\nThe American Canyon resident, who represented the Northern California Section of the PGA, shot 74-72-82-78 – 306. He earned $1,030.\nThe 132-player field, according to pgamediacenter.com, includes PGA of America Assistant Professionals or registered Assistant Professional Associates who earned berths through their local PGA sections.\nStone has worked in the golf department at Silverado Resort for the last three years. He turned professional in 2024 and also earned PGA Class A membership. He works for Troon Golf, which manages golf operations at Silverado Resort. It’s a 36-hole complex with North and South courses.\nThe PGA Tour’s Procore Championship, a FedExCup fall event, is played at Silverado.\n***\nAaron Beverly, who at one time worked in the golf department at Silverado Resort, tied for fifth place in the Advocates Professional Golf Association Tour’s Farmers Fall Series Finale Nov. 12-13 at Tustin Ranch Golf Club.\nThe Sacramento resident shot 67-70 – 137 and earned $2,100 in the final APGA Tour event of the year.\n***\nNapa physician Lauren Gebauer and Erin Sampson won the 20th Northern California Golf Association Women's Four-Ball Championship, shooting 70-66 – 136 at Poppy Ridge New Course in Livermore Nov. 3-4.\nGebauer birdied the first hole of a sudden-death playoff, the par-5 18th, to beat the team of Lynne Cowan and Karen Garcia.\n\"I think it was a great team effort,\" Gebauer said at blog.ncga.org. \"If one of us was down, the other picked it up. We really just gave it our all out there.\"\nGebauer, the NCGA Women's Player of the Year in 2023, is a resident of Orinda and plays out of Green Valley Country Club in Fairfield.\n***\nCharles Porter, who played for Napa Valley College in 2020, placed in recent Asian Tour events.\nThe San Francisco native tied for 40th place (66-72-74-68 – 280) at the International Series Philippines Oct. 23-26 at Sta Elena Golf Club.\nHe tied for 26th place (67-65-63-72 – 267) at the Link Hong Kong Open Oct. 30-Nov. 2 at Hong Kong Golf Club.\nHe tied for 46th place (67-71-72-71 – 281) at the Moutai Singapore Open Nov. 6-9 at the New Course at Singapore Island Country Club.\n***\nThe 2025 high school girls golf season ended for three Napa Valley players at the CIF North Coast Section Division I Championship.\nVintage High’s Brooke Gongora (80) and Justin-Siena’s Kayden Coloma (94) and Kaya Prosser (94) played in the event on Nov. 3 at Windsor Golf Club.",
