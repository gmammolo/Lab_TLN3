  "text": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander battled through illness to deliver a masterclass, scoring 40 points as the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 113-105 Wednesday night at Paycom Center in an NBA Cup showdown.\nListed as questionable before tipoff, Gilgeous-Alexander shot 12-of-19 from the floor and 15-of-17 at the free throw line, gutting out one of his most impressive performances of the season.\nThunder Lean on Defense Late\nAfter Minnesota briefly took a late 94-93 lead following a Naz Reid three, Oklahoma City clamped down defensively. Chet Holmgren’s clutch corner three with 38 seconds remaining swung momentum for good, and the Thunder outscored the Timberwolves 8-1 in the final minute.\nOKC held Minnesota scoreless on three key possessions and forced costly turnovers, sealing a statement win that had the intensity of a playoff game.\nHistoric Start Continues\nThe victory marked Oklahoma City’s 10th straight win and pushed the Thunder to 18-1, making them just the fifth team in NBA history to reach that mark through 19 games. They also improved to 4-0 in West Group A of the NBA Cup.\nThe winner of Friday’s matchup between OKC and Phoenix will automatically advance to the knockout round.\nSGA’s Streak Climbs the All-Time List\nGilgeous-Alexander has now scored at least 20 points in 91 consecutive games, the third-longest streak in NBA history. He can match Wilt Chamberlain’s second-place mark of 92 on Friday against the Suns.\nHolmgren Delivers When It Mattered\nWhile not at his best offensively for much of the night, Holmgren made the most important plays down the stretch, including the game-sealing three and multiple key rebounds.\n“He didn’t have his fastball, but he made winning plays,” head coach Mark Daigneault said. “That’s mental toughness. That’s the shot of the game.”\nMinnesota Fades Late\nAnthony Edwards finished with 31 points and eight rebounds, but Minnesota dropped its third straight game. The Wolves also struggled at the free throw line, going just 22-of-37.\nGame Flow Snapshot\nThunder led 24-17 after one\nOKC took a 49-39 edge into halftime\nMinnesota tied the game twice in the third before OKC entered the fourth up 78-71\nHolmgren’s late three and elite defense closed the door\nWhat It Means\nOklahoma City remains in firm control of its NBA Cup destiny and continues to show no signs of slowing down. Even on a night when their MVP wasn’t feeling well, the Thunder found another gear and another way to win.\nNext up: Thunder vs. Suns on Friday night with the group title and knockout round spot on the line.",
