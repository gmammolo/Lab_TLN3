  "text": "The Lakers are on a five-game win streak and have banded together this season in a way no one has yet seen.\nNow LeBron James is back, the team looks even stronger than they did before and have a level of new found chemistry.\nAustin Reaves gets hits and goes down after a shot, LeBron is the first one there to give him a huge hug.\nWhen Kris Dunn is talking smack to Luka Doncic and shoving him, so Jaxson Hayes goes in and sticks up for his teammate and shoves Dunn right back.\nJJ Redick says this is the kind of stuff he highlights to his players and speaks to the culture they’re trying to build.\n“I mean, we highlight that stuff to our guys all the time,” Redick said after the Lakers’ win over the Clippers in the battle of LA. “Whether it’s celebrating a guy making a shot. We had a great clip from Milwaukee, Nick Smith makes the three, Maxi’s celebrating on the court. Our bench celebrations. Guy falls down after a foul, it happened tonight, multiple guys running over to pick guys up.\n“We’re not saying you have to do that. Those are not requirements but typically guys show their cards and show their hands whether or not they like each other and tonight was another example of that.”\nHayes and Doncic have become so close that Hayes wants to try and play for Slovenia alongside Luka on the national stage.\nMany had their doubts about Redick coming in as a first time coach, but he seems to taking the purple and gold in the right direction.\nHe has led the Lakers to a 57-4 record when leading after 3 quarters, the BEST record in NBA history.\nREAD MORE: Luka Doncic & Jaxson Hayes React to Kris Dunn Scuffle",
