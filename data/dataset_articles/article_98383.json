  "text": "Defending champion Luke Littler hit back from 9-6 down to beat Josh Rock 16-12 and reach the Grand Slam of Darts semifinals in Wolverhampton.\nWorld champion Littler, who has yet to be beaten in the tournament, won seven legs on the spin to open up a 13-9 lead and saw the match out to set up a last-four clash with Danny Noppert.\nLittler averaged 105.18 and landed 11 180s compared to Rock's 101.46, while the Northern Ireland world No. 10 hit 12 180s.\nRock edged into a 3-2 lead after an 84-checkout -- with both players averaging 110 -- and after Littler produced a 78 finish, the match was locked at 5-5 after 10 legs.\nLittler fell 7-6 behind and, after missing his double in the 14th leg, Rock won against the throw on his way to opening up a 9-6 advantage.\nBut Littler came storming back, winning the next seven legs to move 13-9 in front and although Rock stopped the rot to take the next two, he could not make further in-roads on his deficit.\n-\nAt 15-12 up, Littler could afford to miss three attempts at double 10 before sealing victory.\nDutchman Noppert beat German Lukas Wenig 16-8 in his quarterfinal, while world number one Luke Humphries will play another former world champion in Gerwyn Price in Sunday's other semifinal.",
