With this new change, the Pirates remain determined to bounce back stronger.\n“I am happy to join the most successful team in the league. There is no doubt about what the Patna Pirates can achieve. I have reached playoffs in almost all seasons but the trophy is still pending. It feels correct and very much a part of destiny that my first and Pirates' fourth trophy come together,” Jasveer said.\nSpeaking about the change, CEO Pawan Rana stated, \"We are happy to bring in Jasveer Singh as the head coach for the next season. A coach of the highest pedigree, he brings in a wealth of experience and sustained success with his previous team. Together with the boys, this team has what it takes to take our already established success rate to greater heights.\"\nPatna Pirates, known for their fighting spirit, ended Season 12 with a remarkable late surge that helped them reach the playoffs. Although the comeback fell short in the Eliminator, the management appears determined to build on that momentum with a fresh coaching vision under Jasveer.\nThe franchise hopes this new leadership will restore consistency and push the team deeper into the competition next season.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",
