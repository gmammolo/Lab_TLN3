  "text": "Bear down Baby. First place at least for a while; and we are looking good for the playoffs. Da Bears beat the Aaron Rogers-less Steelers Sun. 31-28 without their three starting linebackers. Caleb Williams played like a fifth-round quarterback rather than the first-pick overall that he was. They have been known to break our hearts over the years. Let’s see if Ben Johnson, head coach of the Bears, can keep this Bear train rolling. Good, Better, Best. Never let it rest. Go Bears!!!\n– – – – –\nBack to Ted Conrad who walked out of a bank with a mere $215,000. Monday morning the bank opened and someone went to the vault to get some cash and noticed some was missing. Panic and confusion set in. Immediate inventory was done, and it was definitely missing. They started reviewing logs and seeing who had access, questioning employees. And that’s when someone said, “Where’s Ted Conrad?” He hadn’t showed up for work. His apartment was empty. His belongings were gone. He’d left behind almost nothing – no forwarding address, no note, no trail. He had simply vanished. The FBI was called immediately. The U.S. Marshal’s Service got involved. Ted Conrad’s photo went out on wanted posters. Leads were pursued across the country; but the trail went cold almost instantly. For months, then years, investigators chased leads. They checked border crossings, interviewed friends and family, followed tips that led nowhere. Ted Conrad’s parents insisted they had no idea where he was. His friends said the same. And if anyone knew, they weren’t talking.\nThe case stayed open, but as years turned into decades, it faded from public consciousness. The wanted posters yellowed. The investigators moved on to other cases or retired. The file remained open; but realistically, everyone assumed Ted Conrad was either dead or living somewhere under a fake identity, probably overseas. They were half right.\n– – – – –\nThe NBA is in full swing and that always brings up the debate, who is the GOAT, Greatest of All Time. Of course, I always say Michael Jordon. Others say LeBron James. But do you know why LeBron skipped college? It’s because he is really bad at Finals.\n– – – – –\nMy grandson Ashton, who is in sixth grade, is playing basketball through the school, but in a rec league down in El Paso. They have a beautiful building down there with two courts, a walking track, nets for pickle ball, volleyball courts painted on the floor, concessions and more. Heller Motors and American Builders were big contributors. I see Minonk is now building something similar in their Millennium Park. Man, that would be a great addition to any town. Not sure when they will start building the one in Wenona.\n– – – – –\nI caught my neighbor stealing my socks off of my clothesline. I was going to confront him; but I got cold feet.\n– – – – –\nSteve and Peg Goulding were great contributors to Wenona when they owned the Cookie Factory. Steve has passed, but his passion for Conservation and Environment is still going through his foundation. Camp Cooper, located in Tucson, AZ, has recently dedicated a trail to Steve and the Goulding Family due to his donations. In the past year, 3,200 kids have attended the Camp for classes and another 2,000 more kids were served in the classroom. Now, Phase Two has started and they are building cabins and more. Steve was a great man, and is missed by many. I could never thank him enough for the opportunities he gave a fat kid from Pine St. I understand the Goulding’s are still involved in Wenona and helping with the new building for the Food Pantry, which I think is great. Steve, I miss you big guy. Peg, thanks for all you do to keep his memory alive. I need to get out and see the Camp and everything his foundation is doing.\n– – – – –\nThis week is Thanksgiving. Don’t forget to set your scales back 15 pounds Wed. night at 1 a.m. for Thanksgiving.\n– – – – –\nDoodoo was upset because his wife told him he was her 32nd lover. It’s okay though. What she meant was he was her 30-second lover.\n– – – – –\nPick Facts – Did you know the difference between a cemetery and a graveyard? If the area is off by itself, it is called a cemetery. If it is attached to a church, it’s a graveyard.\n– – – – –\nHappy Thanksgiving – Have a great holiday – Do something nice for someone else.\n– – – – –\n#Wenona Forever",
