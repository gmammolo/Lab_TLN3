  "text": "After experiencing an unfortunate case of the injury bug last season, the Forest Lake girls basketball team is hoping to stay as healthy as possible throughout the 2025 winter campaign as the Rangers gear up and get ready to hit the courts in full swing. The team returns a solid amount of experienced varsity players from last year’s unit, in which the Rangers also have a total of nine senior leaders on roster after losing six from the year prior.\nThose seniors this year include guard Savanna Puent, guard Hailey DeReu, forward Kendal Damon, star guard Aubree Hultman, guard Natalie Krutzig, forwards Sadie Fearing, Aubrey Monzel and Natalie Farrier, along with guard Bailey Zauner.",
