  "text": "There’s nothing Aussies love more during summer than sport – and SA’s serving it up big time. From the crack of the bat at Adelaide Oval to the hum of bikes in the Hills, our state’s summer calendar is absolutely stacked.\nIt’s part of what makes us the Best Event State in Australia – officially. With record hotel stays, a visitor economy worth $9.9 billion and more than 40,000 South Australians working in tourism, sport isn’t just a pastime here. It’s an engine that keeps the state buzzing.\nAnd true to form, we don’t just host the games – we throw the party that goes with them.\nMatildas – 2 December\nWhen the CommBank Matildas last played in Adelaide, more than 52,000 fans packed Adelaide Oval – the biggest crowd South Australia’s ever seen for a women’s ticketed sporting event. This time, they’re back – and once again, the city will be turning out in force for their clash against New Zealand.\nIt’s their final hit-out before the 2026 AFC Women’s Asian Cup, and if you’ve scored a seat, you’re in for an electric night. Expect chants, colour and a wall of green-and-gold energy as the Tillies light up Coopers Stadium.\nThe atmosphere will spill far beyond the stands, so you can join in on the action by heading to your favourite local showing the match with your mates.\nBacked by the South Australian Tourism Commission and Adelaide Venue Management, the match keeps Adelaide in the international spotlight and proves again that this state knows how to show up for women’s sport.\nThe Ashes Christmas Test – 17-21 December at Adelaide Oval\nIt wouldn’t be an Aussie summer without the Ashes, and Adelaide’s Test is the crown jewel. For five glorious days, the city hums with Christmas spirit, sunshine and the sound of leather on willow.\nFrom the opening toss to the fall of the last wicket, there’s no better place to be than our world-famous oval – whether you’re perched on the Hill under the fig trees, soaking up the banter in the Western Stand, or watching from a shaded corporate box with a cold one in hand. However you do it, the atmosphere is pure Adelaide summer.\nJust outside the Oval, the Christmas Test Summer Fest transforms Pennington Gardens into a mini festival, with food trucks, live DJs, interactive cricket zones and family-friendly activities – all within walking distance of the action.\nBig Bash League – 23 December - 17 January\nThe Strikers return for a summer of Big Bash cricket – fast, loud and full of family fun.\nThe standout fixture is New Year’s Eve. The Strikers’ annual showdown and post-match fireworks have become an Adelaide institution, and this year’s live set from Birds of Tokyo will keep the celebrations going long after the final ball.\nBig hits, bright lights, music, food trucks – it’s everything you love about summer in one massive night out.\nAdelaide International – 12-17 January\nThe sound of serves and the smell of sunscreen – tennis season hits The Drive in mid-January, bringing world-class athletes and a party atmosphere to the riverbank for the Adelaide International.\nThis year, defending champion Madison Keys returns after winning both Adelaide and the Australian Open, alongside Olympic gold medallist Belinda Bencic, as well as rising stars Jack Draper and João Fonseca. But the action isn’t just on court.\nPinky Flat transforms into a riverside playground of food trucks, bars, live music and summer vibes.\nFamilies can kick things off with Kids Day – free entry for kids, inflatable tennis courts, games and player appearances. For the rest of us, it’s courtside cocktails, sunshine and watching some of the world’s best serve up a spectacle at The Drive.\nSantos Tour Down Under – 16-25 January\nIf there’s one event that sums up how South Australians do sport, it’s this. The Santos Tour Down Under isn’t just a race – it’s a 10-day statewide celebration that turns the whole place into a festival.\nThe women’s race kicks off the on-road action, featuring all 15 World Teams for the first time and covering a record 395km.\nThe men follow with a 3.6km city prologue, the return of Willunga Hill – tackled three times – and a dramatic finale looping through Stirling’s leafy streets.\nWith crowds lining the coast, the Adelaide Hills and the Barossa, the TDU has become one of the biggest cycling events in the Southern Hemisphere. Last year alone, it attracted 807,900 fans and pumped $62.5 million into the economy.\nMeanwhile, Victoria Square/ Tarntanyangga transforms into the City of Adelaide Tour Village – part beer garden, part expo, part open-air concert. There’s a free opening night with Hot Dub Time Machine, meet-and-greets with pro riders, a family zone, and even a recovery tent for the weekend warriors.\nAnd you don’t have to be a pro to join in. Families can ride the Health Partners Family Ride alongside Olympian Jess Stenson, tackle the Adelaide Epic Ride from Henley Beach to Nairne, hit the gravel with Valtteri Bottas and Tiffany Cromwell in RADL GRVL, or watch daredevils sprint up a six-storey carpark in the Carpark Climb.\nOut in the regions, there’s something happening almost everywhere the peloton goes, including McLaren Vale’s SummerVines festival, Yalumba’s Pedals & Picnics, and the Stirling Spin Off street party.\nAnd country towns right along the route compete for Best Dressed honours, turning their streets into technicolour tributes to cycling. It’s pure South Australian magic – equal parts sport, scenery and celebration.\nLIV Golf Adelaide – 12-15 February at The Grange Golf Club\nJust when you think summer sport’s winding down, Adelaide pulls out this banger. LIV Golf Adelaide has been named the World’s Best Golf Event three years in a row, and with 102,000 fans through the gates last year, it’s not hard to see why.\nPart golf, part music festival, this is where luxury meets chaos – in the best possible way. There’s the Watering Hole (golf’s answer to Glastonbury), Club 54’s pumping decks, and Ripper Point, where Cam Smith’s Aussie team holds court.\nSince debuting in 2023, the event has injected $217 million into SA’s economy and drawn fans from around the world. Whether you’re there for the fairways or the DJs, it’s one of the wildest weekends in the global golfing calendar – and it’s ours.\nWomen’s T20I: Australia v India – 21 February\nOur summer sports calendar’s last hurrah belongs to the Australian women’s cricket team. When the Aussie women take on India in a T20 at Adelaide Oval, the on-field action will be scorching.\nExpect two powerhouse teams, one night under the lights, and an atmosphere that’ll carry you right into autumn.\nIt’s part of a three-match Women’s T20I series, shining another international spotlight on SA, plus one more chance for local crowds to experience why women’s sport keeps increasing its fan numbers.\nThe bigger picture – SA, the Best Events State\nIn October, South Australia was crowned Best Event State of the Year at the Australian Event Awards and Symposium ceremony. It was recognition of our state’s skill in hosting high-quality events and festivals of all sizes.\nFrom the beaches to the Barossa, our calendar doesn’t slow down. Tourism keeps our economy strong, our regions buzzing and our hotels full. The next goal is to grow that visitor economy to $12.8 billion by 2030 – and with a line-up like this, we’re well on our way.\nIn SA, sport isn’t just something you watch. It’s something you live – all summer long.\nFind out about all SA’s upcoming major events here.\nThis story originally appeared on The Post - a media partnership between the Government of South Australia and Solstice Media to inform young South Australians about the policies that underpin issues affecting their lives.",
