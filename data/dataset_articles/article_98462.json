  "text": "Defending champions Safety Babes delivered a commanding performance on Wednesday, overwhelming Ekiti Queens with a decisive 49–22 victory on Day 2 of the Ardova Handball Premier League 2025 Phase 2. The match, held at the Rowe Park Sports Center in Yaba, Lagos, saw the five-time champions assert their dominance from the outset, leading 23–11 at halftime before extending their lead in the second period.\nIn other women’s fixtures, Rima Queens of Sokoto secured a narrow 33–31 win against Rivers Queens, while Omo Ogiefo Academy continued their strong run with a 29–22 victory over Defender Babes. 2018 champions Plateau Peacocks also cruised to a comfortable 30–16 win against Imo Grasshoppers.\nIn the men’s category, Niger United were awarded a walkover against Adamawa Warriors. COAS Shooters rebounded with a strong 36–28 win over Lagos Seasiders, and Rima Strikers proved too strong for De Defenders, winning 28–19. Defending champions Tojemarine Academy faced a tough challenge but ultimately edged out Osun United 18–17 in a low-scoring thriller. League leaders Safety Shooters concluded the day with a 28–17 victory over Correction Boys.",
