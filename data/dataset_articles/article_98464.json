  "text": "Despite winning a sectional championship in 2023, Northview boys basketball head coach Shawn Nevill felt like they snuck up on people with the success the team had.\nThat changed in 2024 when the Knights set several program records in what turned out to be the winningest season in the 40-year history of the school.\nNow? Nevill knows his team is going to get everyone’s best shot. It’s something Northview has embraced – and will continue to embrace – which went into the design of the 2025-26 team shirt.\n“We know we’re going to have a bullseye on us every single game. There’s no more sneaking up on anyone … We took a big jump from 2023 to 2024, and our kids want to take a big jump again. A lot of things went right for us last year, and that led to us having the most wins in school history. We’re going to get everybody’s best shot. We’re going to have to relish that and enjoy it,” said Nevill.\n“On the front of our shirts this year is center court that’s made into a target, which is just a subtle way to always remind ourselves that teams have a target on us,” Nevill continued. “We’ve talked about it. They have high goals, and you can tell these guys want a chance to get back on the state’s biggest stage and show they belong there. We have a lot of things to take care of before that.”\nNorthview took a monumental jump from 2023 to 2024.\nThe program added 10 more wins onto its ledger while also claiming two more trophies – Wabash Valley Classic and Western Indiana Conference – to go along with back-to-back sectional crowns.\nSo, can this team do it again in 2025? Nevill thinks so.\n“This is a group I think that can do that,” he said. “We’re a year bigger and a year stronger. It’s another year in the system for everyone. We just have to make sure we’re working during practices, and the good thing about that is our JV team is full of varsity basketball players that are going to be able to push us every single day. I told them on the first day that I want practice to be our hardest game of the week. We’re going to push each other so hard during the week and by the time we get to the games, it’s going to be easier. We also bumped up our schedule with the Hall of Fame Classic and the Forest Park tournament after playing teams like Pike and Carmel and Avon and Northeastern and Fort Wayne Snider during the summer.”\nNevill’s confidence stems from the experienced roster he has back in the fold.\nLed by senior guards Brayden Goff and Avery Perry, along with juniors Trayven Buis and Peyton McCollum and sophomore Quinn Lewis, the Knights bring back the majority of last year’s key contributors.\nNorthview added another piece to the puzzle in Gavin Deighton, a 6-foot-4 guard who transferred from West Vigo, that should bring another dynamic to the group this winter.\n“I would describe him similarly to [Karson] Fosdick but he’s more of a guard. He’s not going to be in the post like Fosdick was, but he picks and pops a lot like Fosdick did,” said Nevill of Deighton. “He’s got a really good shot. They played a little bit slower last season at West Vigo, so he’s going to have to adjust to our speed, but he’s done a great job. He’s been a nice addition. I expect him to play a big role for us.”\nNorthview will have several others in the mix for meaningful minutes, most of which will likely go to junior Gibson Schimmel and sophomores Cooper Schimmel and Levi Carr, all of whom spent the majority of the 2024-25 campaign at the junior varsity level.\nNevill foresees each of them carving out specific roles this year, which should help build out the depth for the group.\n“We have to build depth. We’re trying to find what new roles everyone is going to have,” said Nevill. “I do think there’re roles for guys like Cooper and Levi and Gibby. When is that? How will it fit? Are we going to have a bigger bench early in the season and then tighten it later? Those are questions that we’re going to have to answer.”\nNorthview will start to answer those questions in its season opener on Saturday against Greencastle at the fifth annual Gobbler Games Shootout.",
