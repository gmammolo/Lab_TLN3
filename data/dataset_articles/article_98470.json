  "text": "When Quadarius Wallace accepted the head coach position for the Daviess County High School football program following the 2024 season, he knew the Panthers had potential — having served many seasons as an assistant under former DC head coach Matt Brannon.\nNonetheless, Wallace faced an uphill battle in a program that had finished 1-10 in Anthony Payton's lone season at the helm.\nStill, Wallace and the Panthers made a significant climb this fall, going 5-5 in the regular season and defeating arch-rival Apollo to close it out.\nAdd it all up and Wallace was selected as the 2025 the Messenger-Inquirer Area Football Coach of the Year.\n\"The buy-in was the key,\" Wallace said. \"I came back here with an agenda for players and coaches to be all-in. I challenged them every day and our team accepted the challenge. I told them that we can't just talk about it — we've got to do it on the field of play.\"\nThe Panthers responded in kind, posting victories over Russellville, Christian County, McLean County, Central Hardin, and Apollo — and in so doing, pumping new life into the Daviess County program.\nAnd the transformation extended well beyond football.\n\"I stressed classroom work, being a quality person at school and out in the community,\" Wallace said. \"I challenged them to be accountable on the football field and in every other facet of their lives, and this group responded in the right way — they realized the benefits.\"\nOn the field, meanwhile, the Panthers put together an attack that was more difficult for opponents to defend.\n\"We were a more balanced team this year, with the ability to throw the football,\" Wallace said. \"(Quarterback) Garrison Barker became more of a threat with his arms and his legs, and this opened up more opportunities for some of our other skill players — defenses could not just key on one guy.\"\nDefensively, the Panthers became markedly more opportunistic.\n\"We had guys were flying around to the ball, and we wound up creating 20-plus turnovers,\" Wallace said. \"I put a big emphasis on that right from the start, and our players came through for us.\"\nThe team's overall spirit was enhanced, as well.\n\"The determination and fight this team exhibited was very special,\" Wallace said. \"It started well before the season began, and it kept building and building as the season progressed. Even after losses, this group didn't stay down for long.\"\nCamaraderie was also a key element to the team's improvement.\n\"These players pushed themselves to become better players,\" Wallace said. \"Togetherness was big for us, and this can determine how much success you have. These kids played for each other and not for themselves, and this showed up on the field of play.\"\nWorth noting is that Daviess County's two Class 6-A district losses were by a single point. Henderson County beat the Panthers 7-6 in Henderson, and DC lost at home to Meade County, 21-20.\n\"It hurt us — those were two nights we didn't play very well,\" Wallace said. \"I told our guys after those games not to forget the feeling, and they battled back and finished the regular season strong with a victory at Apollo.\"\nThrough it all, Wallace and DC kept the faith — literally.\n\"We're a faith-based football team and we want to glorify God through the game of football,\" Wallace said. \"We always put God first, always keep faith at the forefront — all the glory goes to God.\"",
