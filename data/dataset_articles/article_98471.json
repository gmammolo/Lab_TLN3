  "text": "ALBUQUERQUE\nWhen all else fails, give it to the kid.\nLobos basketball fans wondered what their cherry-and-silver universe would look like when Jake Hall got hot from the 3-point line. As it turns out, it’s pretty impressive.\nDecorated as the most prolific scorer in San Diego boys basketball history, the 6-foot-4 shooting guard tied the University of New Mexico’s freshman record by hitting seven 3-pointers in a 93-87 win over visiting Alabama State on Wednesday night in The Pit.\nHall’s career-high 24-point night saw him score 21 in the second half. At one point, he hit 6 of 8 shots from beyond the arc as the Lobos (5-2) rallied from a 15-point deficit against the 19.5-point underdog Hornets.\n“Jake’s an amazing player, great shooter,” said fellow freshman Uriah Tenette. “Every time he shoots the ball, you think it’s going in. His nickname is the ‘Problem Child,’ so when he gets going, it’s going to be a problem.”\nThe low point of the night came early in the second half when Lobos point guard Deyton Albury missed a wide-open layup with 17:08 remaining and Alabama State up by 12. The Hornets immediately pushed the ball up court and got a 3-pointer from Asjon Anderson to make it 60-45. That sequence drew a flurry of moans and boos from the announced crowd of 12,027.\nAlabama State (3-5) shot 61% in the first half and made 9 of 14 tries from 3-point range. The Hornets outscored the Lobos 14-4 off turnovers in the first 20 minutes and outrebounded UNM, had more second-chance points, blocks, assists and fast-break opportunities.\n“Certainly we were responsible for our fair share of that,” said UNM coach Eric Olen.\nGiven the logistics, this was never supposed to happen. Alabama State was playing the fifth and final game of a 12-day Rockies road trip that had them get crushed at Colorado on\nNov. 17, lose to Mountain West cellar dweller Air Force and drop three of the four road games (all by at least 15 points) before Wednesday.\nThe Lobos were well on their way to getting back into it when the under-12 timeout rolled around with the Hornets nursing a 70-62 lead. During the timeout, UNM football coach Jason Eck walked to center court and pumped up the crowd with a rah-rah speech in which he predicted the basketball team would claw its way back for a win with the fans’ help.\nHall eventually tied it with three straight free throws to make it 75-all with 8:14 remaining, then a pair of Albury free throws with 3:02 left put New Mexico on top for good. It was part of a 13-1 run to close the game out as the Lobos outscored Alabama State 31-17 after Eck’s speech.\nHall said he could feel the Pit’s energy as the rally gained steam.\n“Super fun environment, you know, definitely a few moments where I just had to pinch myself and live in the moment,” he said. “Things I’ve dreamed of, so it was super cool.”\nFor his part, Olen said the composure he shows regardless of the situation is something he hopes his players adopt when in the huddle during timeouts. When they’re on the floor, and The Pit crowd comes to life, however, he doesn’t mind getting the edge the fans provide.\n“I think the crowd and the building deserve a lot of credit tonight,” he said.\nNOTES\nYou don’t see that often: A Chris Howell 3-point try from the corner as the shot clock expired with 8:20 left in the first half was off the mark — and then some. The shot was well short, and the ball got wedged between the backboard and the inner curvature of the rim.\nIt necessitated a jump ball and alternate possession. The arrow pointed UNM’s way, allowing for a fresh shot clock and a new possession.\nStatcast: Freshman forward Tomislav Buljan was averaging a double-double and was the team’s leading scorer and rebounder coming in, but he was held to five points and seven rebounds.\nAlbury had 18 points, getting 12 of those from the free throw line as the Lobos attempted 38 foul shots compared to 20 for Alabama State. The Hornets were called for 25 fouls, but only had one player foul out.\nChol had 12 points for UNM, but neither he nor Hall grabbed a single rebound in 52-plus combined minutes of playing time.\nInfirmary: Buljuan rolled his ankle with 14 seconds left and was helped off the court. He needed assistance from the training staff to make it back to the locker room. Olen did not have an update immediately after the game.\nRally time: This was the largest comeback since March 13, 2019, when the Lobos trailed Wyoming by 16 in the second half of a Mountain West Tournament game and came back to win.\nRecord book: Hall’s seven 3s tied the UNM freshman standard set in 1997 by Kevin Henry in a game against Holy Cross.\nPortal update: The men’s and women’s transfer portal windows would be shortened to 15 days and open for activity after the men’s and women’s Final Fours under a measure proposed by the Division I oversight committee.\nThe Division I Cabinet is scheduled to review the proposal in January. If approved, the legislation would take effect in April.\nUnder these proposals, the Division I women’s basketball notification-of-transfer window would be open from April 6-20. The men’s window would be open from April 7-21.\nThe transfer windows currently open after the second round of the Division I men’s and women’s tournaments, and they stay open for 30 days.\nThe oversight committees also proposed a change regarding when student-athletes can request to enter the transfer portal after a coaching change. There would be a five-day period for the new staff to meet their current players after a hire is announced. When those five days are up, student-athletes would have a 15-day window to notify their school about entering the transfer portal.\nIf a new head coach isn’t hired within 30 days of the previous coach’s departure, that 15-day window would start on the 31st day. If a coaching change is made after Jan. 1, student-athletes would have to wait until the notification-of-transfer window opens in April.",
