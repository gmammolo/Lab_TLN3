  "text": "The Green Brigade have made a brilliant announcement and one that cuts right to the heart of what Celtic supporters stand for. 1 of 4 4th May 2025; Ibrox Stadium, Glasgow, Scotland; Scottish Premiership Football, Rangers versus Celtic; Celtic fans with smoke pyrotechnics and rangers banners before the match Soccer Football - Scottish Cup - Semi Final - St Johnstone v Celtic - Hampden Park, Glasgow, Scotland, Britain - April 20, 2025 General view of Celtic fans in the stands REUTERS/Russell Cheyne 2nd February 2025; Fir Park, Motherwell, Scotland; Scottish Premiership Football, Motherwell versus Celtic; Celtic fans sing for Jota Joao Pedro Neves Filipe of Celtic Soccer Football - Champions League - Aston Villa v Celtic - Villa Park, Birmingham, Britain - January 29, 2025 Celtic fans inside the stadium before the match REUTERS/Hannah Mckay Despite being banned from attending matches , the group have confirmed that their annual foodbank collection will go ahead as planned before Celtic v Hearts on Sunday, 7 December.\nWhatever the internal battles at the club right now, helping people in our communities comes first.\nIn the video released with the announcement, the scale of the need was laid bare.\nOne in four children in Scotland now lives in poverty, and one in five working people also find themselves struggling to afford essentials.\nPoverty isn’t something happening elsewhere, it’s on our doorsteps.\nThe video also highlighted that 61% of working-age adults and 68% of children in poverty come from households where at least one person is in work. Even earning a wage is no longer enough.\nThe figures are even starker for vulnerable groups. Nearly 40% of single mothers in Scotland are living in poverty, while 14% of pensioners are also affected. And for families with a disabled member, 23% are living below the poverty line.\nDespite being banned from the match, the Green Brigade foodbank collection will go ahead as planned before Celtic v Hearts on Sun 7 Dec.\nPlease give what you can to support those in need across our communities, particularly in the run up to Christmas and harsher winter months. pic.twitter.com/nPMyvvw3kR\n— North Curve Celtic (@NCCeltic) November 25, 2025\nThese are the people foodbanks are keeping afloat.\nWith winter approaching and Christmas around the corner, the Green Brigade have urged supporters to give whatever they can.\nFoodbanks across Scotland are most in need of tinned meat and fish, vegetables, tomatoes, pasta, rice, UHT milk and long-life juice. Non-food essentials are equally important, such as toiletries, nappies, baby wipes, menstrual products, and the everyday items many families simply can’t afford right now.\nWhatever anyone thinks about the wider situation at Celtic, this initiative is a reminder of something bigger.\nSupporters helping supporters, and a fanbase doing what the club’s founders intended, looking after those who need it most.",
