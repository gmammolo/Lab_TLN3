  "text": "S8UL Esports, a global name in esports and gaming content, has onboarded high-performance smartphone brand iQOO as the Title Sponsor for its Pokémon UNITE and MOBA Legends 5v5 rosters. With this strengthened alliance, iQOO deepens its commitment to supporting India’s top esports talent while S8UL further accelerates its multi-title expansion ahead of a landmark competitive season.\niQOO becomes title sponser of S8UL Esports’ MOBA Legends 5v5 and Pokémon Unite Roster\niQOO has supported the growth of Indian esports for several years, working closely with top teams and major tournaments. Its continued association with iQOO SOUL, one of India’s leading BGMI rosters, has contributed to the team’s strong performances, including its recent win at the Chennai Esports Global Championship 2025.\nExtending this support to S8UL’s newly signed rosters, the brand will equip athletes with its powerful, gaming-optimized smartphones to enhance their training and tournament preparation. As part of the partnership, the iQOO logo will feature prominently on the front of the team jerseys, and both rosters will now compete under the names iQOO S8UL Pokémon UNITE and iQOO S8UL MOBA Legends 5v5.\n“iQOO has been with S8UL for a long time, starting with our BGMI team, and their support has played an important role in our journey. Extending this partnership to our Pokémon UNITE and MOBA Legends 5v5 teams is a natural next step as we grow across more titles. Our focus at S8UL is to build strong, well-prepared rosters in every game we enter, and working with a partner like iQOO helps us give our players the tools they need to compete with confidence in India and internationally.,” said Animesh Agarwal, Co-founder and CEO of S8UL Esports.\nS8UL’s Pokémon UNITE team, led by captain Manmohan Singh (AllMight) and comprising Rahul Sharad Lavhate (Kyurem), Deep Patel (Snowyy), Adnan Badshah (Badshahh), and Rudra Narayan Nayak (ReX), is widely regarded as the top roster in the South Asia region. The team has claimed three regional championships in the last three years and has consistently represented India on the international stage at the Pokémon UNITE World Championship.\nThe organization’s newly signed MOBA Legends 5v5 roster arrives with a wealth of experience and an impressive track record across India’s community-led tournaments. The team includes in-game leader Mohammad Saad (Apex), Abhijeet Katkar (Abhi), Mehta Jay (J), Chirag Singh (Radium), Debasish Sana (Anti) and Anush N (Fear). Apex notably competed at the MLBB Mid Season Cup 2024 at the Esports World Cup, which featured a staggering USD 3 million (approx. INR 26.7 crore) prize pool.\nRead More about BGMI\nThe enhanced partnership with iQOO comes at a time when S8UL is rapidly scaling its multi-title presence. Earlier this year, S8UL became the first and only Indian organisation selected for the prestigious Club Partner Program of the Esports World Cup 2025, placing it among the world’s elite esports organisations.\nOn the content front, the organization recently won the ‘Esports Content Group of the Year’ for the fourth time in a row, while Co-Founder Animesh “8Bit Thug” Agarwal earned the title of ‘Esports Personality of the Year’ at the Esports Awards 2025, underlining the organisation’s unmatched influence across both esports and creator ecosystems.\nBy bringing two high-potential rosters under the iQOO S8UL banner, the organisation reinforces its drive to build winning line-ups across every title it enters. The newly branded iQOO S8UL Pokémon UNITE roster will be the first to step into action, competing at the Pokémon UNITE Asia Champions League 2026 – India from November 29.",
