  "text": "Former Chelsea captain John Terry has said that the club have one of the best players in the world right now, and it’s not Moises Caicedo.\nTerry was speaking off the back of Chelsea thrashing Barcelona 3-0 on Wednesday night in the Champions League match up.\nEXCLUSIVE! Chelsea now being ‘aggressive and bold’ in attempts to convince Arsenal star to join them!\nThe former Blues defender has been raving about Marc Cucurella after a fine performance in this game, but he’s not the only one.\nFormer England striker Wayne Rooney says that Cucurella put in one of the best left back performances he has seen in a long time in this game versus Barcelona.\nCucurella was so good that he managed to keep one of the best up and coming wingers in the game, Lamine Yamal, dead quiet and make him look less than average even. Robert Sanchez said after the game that Cucurella had Yamal in his pocket!\nBut Terry thinks Cucurella is now one of the best in the world in his position.\nTerry on Cucurella\n“I also have to speak about Cucurella, how good was he last night? I’m going to put it out there. He is one of the best left-backs in world football at the moment.\n“He is everything I want to see in a Chelsea player at the moment, aggression, great one vs one, a threat going forwards, the threat he shows in every aspect of his game is what I love about him as a player.”\nI fully agree with this\nThe Spaniard has been consistently very good for the last two years now and he has really showed why he was so highly rated before he came to Chelsea.\nHe had a rough start but has really turned things around and really, on current form, he is one of the best around.",
