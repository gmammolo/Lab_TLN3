  "text": "Suresh Raina turned 39 on Thursday (November 27). Popular among fans as Mr IPL or Chinna Thala, Raina made immense contribution to Indian cricket without ever being the loudest or most celebrated name. (BCCI Photo) First Indian to score a T20I century: Long before T20 batting became a power-hitters’ parade, Raina was stepping out, finding angles, taking risks and redefining intent. He became the first Indian to score a T20I century, the first Indian with hundreds in all three formats. The middle-overs accelerator: Raina was key to India's success in limited overs by tackling the middle overs in the best possible manner. He attacked spin, kept the strike rotating, which made tricky targets feel manageable. (Photo: Road Safety World Series) IPL consistency like nobody else: With 5,528 runs, 39 fifties, nine straight seasons of 350+ runs and more than 400 playoff runs, Raina became the benchmark for reliability in the IPL. And then there was that unforgettable 87* off 25 balls - still one of the most electrifying innings the league has ever seen. The fielding maestro: Raina was master at this art by throwing himself into stops, pulling off run-outs and taking catches that lifted teammates and changed the momentum of the game. An all-round package: Apart from batting, Raina's handy off-spin earned him 64 international wickets. (AFP Photo) What is he doing now? After retiring from cricket, Raina has shifted towards commentary. He is also the Suresh Raina, brand ambassador of Indian Softball Cricket Foundation (ISCF), which recently launched its league, currently underway with 32 teams participating. It is learnt that he is likely to return to action in the inaugural edition of the Legends Pro T20 League, which begins from January 26 in Goa.\",",
