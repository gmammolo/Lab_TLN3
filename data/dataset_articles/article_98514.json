  "text": "The Wild haven’t had to rally much, but they weren’t rusty when they finally needed their resilience.\nThey trailed for the first time in nine games before polishing off a 4-3 comeback in overtime against the Blackhawks on Wednesday night at United Center to extend their season-high win streak to six games.\nKirill Kaprizov broke a 3-3 tie on a 4-on-3 power play only 1 minute, 36 seconds into overtime after two tying goals from Matt Boldy and Nico Sturm in the third period.\nBrock Faber also scored, his second goal in as many games.\nAfter Chicago was held in check by a 20-save first period from goaltender Filip Gustavsson, the Blackhawks pulled away in the second period on goals from Jason Dickinson and Connor Bedard.\nThe 505:41 the Wild went without falling behind was the longest run in the NHL since the Blues went 512:37 during the 2018-19 season.\nGustavsson’s valiant effort ended with 34 stops, while the Blackhawks’ Spencer Knight made 20 saves.\nThe Wild improved to 10-1-1 in November and are on a nine-game point streak (8-0-1).\nHow it happened\nThe Wild were coming off back-to-back shutouts, blanking the Penguins (5-0) and Jets (3-0) on the road, but they were leaking chances early.\nGustavsson faced one more shot in the first period than he did in his 19-stop victory at Pittsburgh last Friday. He got in front of tips, fended off looks from deeper in the zone and even got a piece of a shot from Bedard out of the penalty box with his shoulder.\nBut Chicago finally got a puck by Gustavsson in the second when a turnover to the middle by Yakov Trenin was pounced on by Dickinson, who wired in a one-timer at 5:41 to sink the Wild into their first 1-0 deficit in 13 games; they previously scored first in a franchise-record 12 straight.\nThen a net-crashing Bedard was left all alone for a redirect at 12:08.\n The last time the Wild were down by two goals was their 4-1 loss to the Penguins on Oct. 30, the line in the sand of their season.\nTurning point\nLater in the second, Chicago capitalized again when Tyler Bertuzzi buried a rebound, but the goal was overturned after the Wild successfully challenged for off-side.\nNot going up 3-0 stung the Blackhawks.\nWith 14 seconds to go in the period, Faber’s shot sailed off the post and in for his sixth goal of the season and a late lift that carried over into the third: Just 2:17 into the period, Sturm deflected in a Jonas Brodin shot for his first goal in his second game back from a back injury that delayed his start to the season.\nChicago answered back when Artyom Levshunov netted his first NHL goal at 5:31, a backhander after accepting a Bedard pass and cutting to the front of the net.\nBut the Wild caught up again.\nBoldy flung the puck into a vacant Blackhawks net at 10:35 with Knight sprawled out after making an earlier save on Boldy before Brodin scooped up the rebound and set up the winger for his 14th goal.\nJoel Eriksson Ek was slashed and hooked on separate shifts, but the only power play in the period went to Chicago. The Blackhawks couldn’t convert, going 0 for 4, and that clutch penalty kill paved the way for the Wild power play to deliver in OT to finish 1 for 5.\nUp next\nThe Wild return home for a Friday matinee against another Central Division rival in the Avalanche, who are atop the NHL.\n©2025 The Minnesota Star Tribune.
