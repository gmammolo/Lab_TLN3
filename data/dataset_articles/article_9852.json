  "text": "Firefighters prevent explosion during TN house fire with 20 lbs. of gunpowder in garage\nThere are simple steps people should take to protect their weapons and explosives during a fire, officials said.\nROBERTSON COUNTY, Tenn. (WSMV) - Quick work by firefighters averted a highly dangerous situation in Robertson County when a home caught fire with explosives inside.\nPleasant View Volunteer Fire Department Lt. Drew Akin said they were called to the home along Stroudville Road on Wednesday evening that had multiple guns, ammunition and 20 lbs. of gunpowder inside.\nPhotos from our partners at Smokey Barn News showed flames shooting out of the attic of the home when firefighters first arrived on scene.\nThe owner told WSMV off camera he was asleep when the smoke alarms started going off. He grabbed their cats and ran outside to call 911.\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: TN home damaged in fire that left one injured\nAkin said he sent a crew into the garage first because that’s where the gunpowder was being stored. They then worked towards the other areas of the house that were on fire to prevent an explosion.\n“The structure will likely be a loss, but like I told the family, they’ll be able to at least get inside and get some things out,” Akin said. “A lot of people don’t have that opportunity. I’m proud of the work that our team did.”\nHere are instructions on how to watch WSMV4 live on various platforms.\nFirefighters are used to dealing with guns and bullets going off in homes, but Akin said it is very important for people to have them stored properly. Explosives only further fuel a fire and pose a risk for crews in a house.\nThis family helped firefighters by having much of their weapons secured in safes and closing doors before they went outside. The door to the garage was covered with black smoke and char marks but was not burnt through.\n“Definitely close the doors in your house,” Akin said. “I know it’s crazy. The house I live in, we try to keep the doors open to keep the air circulating. It can be tough especially when you are sleeping at night, but you’ve got to close those doors. Closing the doors could potentially save your life and it can stop the spread of the fire and the smoke.”\nAkin said people should also consider storing explosives somewhere outside of their main house, so they are insulated and have more time for firefighters to get to them.\nCopyright 2025 WSMV.
