  "text": "To news overview© XPBimages\nFerrari has secured the 2025 DHL Fastest Pit Stop Award, ending Red Bull’s long-running dominance in F1’s pit lane.\nThe Italian squad’s crew has delivered an impressively consistent campaign, regularly logging stops in the 2.5-second window and rarely putting a wheel wrong across the season.\nThe decisive moment came after the Las Vegas Grand Prix, where Ferrari’s advantage became mathematically unassailable.\nThe Scuderia now sit on 522 points, comfortably clear of Red Bull on 346. McLaren (342) and Racing Bulls (332) remain close to the Milton Keynes team, but with only 86 points left on the table – mirroring the constructors' championship scoring – Ferrari’s margin is more than enough to seal the title.\nView the DHL Fastest Pit Stop Award standings below! The article continues beneath.\nDHL Fastest Pit Stop Award standings after Las Vegas\n| # | Constructor | Points |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1. | Ferrari | 522 |\n| 2. | Red Bull | 346 |\n| 3. | McLaren | 342 |\n| 4. | Racing Bulls | 332 |\n| 5. | Mercedes | 248 |\n| 6. | Sauber | 181 |\n| 7. | Alpine | 99 |\n| 8. | Williams | 62 |\n| 9. | Aston Martin | 48 |\n| 10 | Haas | 42 |\nEnd to Red Bull's winning streak\nThe result brings an end to Red Bull’s extraordinary run, with the team having claimed every DHL Fastest Pit Stop Award from 2018 to 2024.\nFerrari last topped the standings in 2015, the inaugural year of the competition, making this their first triumph in nearly a decade.\nInterestingly, despite winning the championship, Ferrari does not feature among the top six fastest individual pit stops of the season.\nMcLaren occupies the first three positions, while Red Bull holds fourth, fifth and sixth. Both teams dipped below the two-second barrier on three occasions, whereas Ferrari’s best effort stands at an even 2.00 seconds, achieved twice.\nUltimately, raw one-off speed mattered less than consistency, and it is that relentless execution that ensures the trophy is heading back to Maranello.\nView the fastest ten pit stops of 2025 below!\nThe ten fastest pit stops of 2025 so far\n| # | Constructor | Time | Driver | Grand Prix |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1. | McLaren | 1.91s | Oscar Piastri | Italy |\n| 2. | McLaren | 1.94s | Lando Norris | Hungary |\n| 3. | McLaren | 1.94s | Oscar Piastri | Hungary |\n| 4. | Red Bull | 1.95s | Yuki Tsunoda | Brazil |\n| 5. | Red Bull | 1.97s | Yuki Tsunoda | Hungary |\n| 6. | Red Bull | 1.99s | Yuki Tsunoda | Las Vegas |\n| 7. | Ferrari | 2.00s | Charles Leclerc | Monaco |\n| 8. | Ferrari | 2.00s | Charles Leclerc | Saudi Arabia |\n| 9. | Ferrari | 2.04s | Charles Leclerc | Italy |\n| 10. | Ferrari | 2.04s | Charles Leclerc | Hungary |\nJoin the conversation!",
