  "text": "Champions Thunder roll on to make it 10-straight in NBA\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander has overcome illness to pilot powerhouse Oklahoma City to their 10th straight win with a 113-105 victory in their NBA Cup game against Minnesota Timberwolves.\nWinning a rematch of their 2025 Western Conference finals, the defending champions became just the fifth team in NBA history to start a season 18-1.\nGilgeous-Alexander was listed as \"questionable\" and made a decision to play in the Paycom Centre clash on Wednesday night (local time) after the warm-up.\nWhile the livewire guard said post match he felt more tired than usual, he showed no signs as he tallied 40 points, making 12 of 19 field goals and 15 of 17 free throws.\nHe also added six rebounds, six assists and three steals as the Thunder moved to 4-0 in West Group A Cup standings.\nGilgeous-Alexander has scored at least 20 points in 91 consecutive games, the third-longest streak in NBA history behind two streaks by Wilt Chamberlain.\nThe 27-year-old, the NBA's MVP last season, can match Chamberlain's second-place run of 92 straight in Thunder's next match, against Phoenix.\nThe Thunder led 24-17 at the end of the opening quarter, restricting Minnesota to their second lowest point total in any quarter this season.\nGilgeous-Alexander scored 19 points in the first half to help the Thunder take a 49-39 lead.\nMinnesota rallied in the third quarter and tied it at 54 and again at 56, but the Thunder took a 78-71 lead into the fourth.\nThe Timberwolves trailed by one point in the final minute after Anthony Edwards made a contested three-pointer, but a Chet Holmgren three-pointer with 38 seconds remaining gave the home side some breathing space.\nOklahoma City outscored Minnesota 8-1 in the last 60 seconds to seal the win.\nEdwards led the scoring for the visitors with 31 points as well as eight rebounds, but the Timberwolves' cause wasn't helped by making a miserly 22 of 37 free throws.\nIn other matches, Memphis inflicted more pain on the New Orleans Pelicans with a 133-128 win in overtime.\nSnapping a nine-game losing streak on Monday night, the Pelicans overcame a slow start and were up by 17 at quarter-time, holding that lead until late in the fourth quarter.\nThey then had to rely on Zion Williamson to level the score with 0.9 seconds remaining.\nJose Alvarado's sixth three-pointer tied the score at 128 late in overtime, but Jaren Jackson Jr found Jaylen Wells behind the New Orleans defence for a dunk with 47 seconds on the clock that gave the Grizzlies the lead for good.\nAustralian centre Jock Landale had a quiet game with 11 points and three rebounds in 18 minutes off the bench after tying his career-high NBA score with 26 points in Memphis's last outing.\nAmong the other results, Brandon Ingram made a pull-up jumper with 0.6 seconds left to secure Toronto's ninth straight win, banking a 97-95 victory against Indiana.\nMiami downed the Milwaukee Bucks 106-103, the Knicks rolled Charlotte 129-101 and the Boston Celtics ended Detroit's winning streak at a franchise record-tying 13 with a 117-114 scoreline.\nBasketball",
