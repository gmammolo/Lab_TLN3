  "text": "Bokaro: A total of 42 people were rescued from their waterlogged homes near Tiranga Park in Sector-1 of Bokaro Township late Thursday.The district has received continuous rainfall for the past 72 hours. Areas, especially under the railway underpass near the CZ gate on the Nayamoad-Marafari route, are submerged while roads in Chas, Chira Chas, and Bari Cooperative localities are inundated.The gates of the district's two major dams, Tenughat and Garga, have been opened. The water level of Tenughat Dam reservoir was 849.60ft on Thursday at 6pm. Five radial gates and two sluice gates were releasing 18,800 cusecs of water. The BSL opened two gates of the Garga Dam by 18 inches and one gate by four inches to reduce the water level from 768ft to 765ft, said BSL spokesperson Manikant Dhan.The district administration has put Chas and Bermo officials on high alert. Block development officers (BDOs) are monitoring low-lying riverbanks as the water levels of both the Damodar and Garga rivers have risen. District disaster management officer (DDMO) Shakti Kumar said, \\\"The water released from the dam has flooded major rivers. The residents of nearby areas have been alerted.\\\" Water of Ijri, Damodar, and Garga rivers have overflowed several small bridges built across the rivers. Deputy collector (land reform) Prabhas Dutta said, \\\"The affected individuals, including elderly people, women, and children, were safely relocated to the Sector-1 town hall, where food and shelter arrangements were made.\\\"The DC directed the officials concerned to up their vigil of bridges, culverts, buildings, and other structures without delay to prevent any mishaps. \\\"If any structure appears unsafe or shows signs of damage, appropriate signage must be installed immediately to warn the public. Sensitive spots must be marked clearly. Special attention must be given to the quality and safety of under-construction projects,\\\" he added.The unrelenting rain has hit business. Commercial areas like City Center and Chas witnessed a sharp fall in customer footfall. A trader at City Center, Ramesh Kumar, said, \\\"The continuous rain has made it difficult for customers to reach my shop. Sales have dropped significantly.\\\"",
