Ingram’s jumper from the elbow with just 0.6 seconds left kept the Raptors’ nine-game winning streak alive, and GloRilla’s courtside reaction quickly stole the spotlight.\nThe NBA’s official Instagram shared a short clip showing the pair screaming in joy, walking into a hug, and executing a unique handshake that ended with a kiss. Fans quickly flocked to the comments, sharing their delight.\n“He’s happy with her that’s good 💯🙏🏾,” one wrote.\nA fan added, “I’m not gonna lie since they got together he been going crazy 💯💯🔥.”\n“I’m ngl I type love to see this 😂😂😂🔥,” another admitted.\nOthers added, “Aweeeee😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥 I’m over here SMILING HARD as ever. I ❤️ them,”\n“He about to get Glo’d up🤣🤣🤣🤣,” said a commenter.\nOne commented with, “see now this a couple we will support and love to see 🔥.”\nThe Raptors’ win over the Pacers was fueled by Ingram’s game-high 26 points, along with eight rebounds, two steals, and a block. Teammate Scottie Barnes contributed 24 points and 10 rebounds.\nThe Raptors’ victory also marked their fourth win in the Emirates NBA Cup, and they now hold a 14-5 record this season. Fans have noticed that Ingram, previously sidelined due to injuries, is thriving alongside teammates Barnes, RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley.\nGloRilla and Brandon Ingram’s Relationship\nAlthough GloRilla and Ingram have not publicly confirmed their relationship, evidence points strongly to a romance. She has attended multiple Raptors games, both home and away, and has been seen wearing a No. 3 diamond chain matching Ingram’s jersey number. The couple has also been spotted sharing vacation moments in Mexico, and Ingram was photographed kissing GloRilla at a previous game.\nFans are clearly loving the pairing, and social media reaction indicates excitement and support for their apparent relationship.\nBeyond courtside appearances, GloRilla continues to make waves in music. Fresh off her 2024 album Glorious, she is set to headline the halftime show at the Bayou Classic alongside Grambling State University’s Tiger Marching Band.\nFrom dominating music charts to turning Raptors games into fashion moments, GloRilla is proving herself a multifaceted star while supporting her NBA beau in dramatic style.\nThe Full List of 2026 Grammy Nominees, Plus Everything Else You Need to Know About This Year's Ceremony\nKendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga and Bad Bunny are among this year’s most nominated artists.\nChristina Izzo\nAbout the author\nMadz Dizon\nEntertainment Writer, Parade",
