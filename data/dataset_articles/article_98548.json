  "text": "Up-and-coming fighter Sherize Verster battled through three intense rounds to claim victory in the women’s bantamweight division at a recent national MMA tournament in Durban.\nShe defeated Durban’s Lee Baraza by unanimous decision at the Lights Out Promotion event on November 8.\nAlthough a resident of Richards Bay, Sherize is coached by Ballito’s Morné Swanepoel of CombatCoaching.com.\n“She is incredibly committed and hard-working and has a bright future ahead of her in both MMA and Brazilian jiu-jitsu,” said Swanepoel.\nWhile celebrating Sherize’s success, the Combat Coaching team is already gearing up for more high-profile bouts. Morné’s son, Bradley Swanepoel, will return to the cage on December 4 on the prelim card for EFC 130 in Johannesburg. Just two days later, more athletes from the team will compete in a grappling tournament in Durban on December 6.\nFor those keen to get involved in combat sports, CombatCoaching.com will host a free ladies’ self-defence workshop at their Ballito headquarters in George’s Park, 58 Moffatt Drive, this Saturday. Spaces are limited and booking is essential. WhatsApp 083 226 1576 to secure your spot.",
