  "text": "Maranatha Bible Camp responds to Texas flooding with prayers and preparedness\nNORTH PLATTE, Neb. (KNOP) - Days after flash flooding wreaked havoc along Texas’ Guadalupe River, Maranatha Bible Camp in Maxwell, Nebraska, is expressing both concern for affected communities and confidence in its own weather emergency preparedness.\nLeaders at the Bible camp are using the moment to reinforce their own safety procedures.\n“The first thing that we would have to be aware of is the risk. We have the Platte River and a creek branching off behind us and then up the river, we have Lake McConaughy,” said Director of HR & Ministry Anthony Ramirez. ”The two places that we could possibly see water coming in from and that we have seen in the past.\"\nRamirez adds how the camp benefits from its location and the chance of flooding remains low.\n“The Federal Emergency Management Agency they provide a map that indicates a flood risk and so being right next to the interstate, were in an area where that is considered a one percent flood risk,“ said Ramirez. ”It’s also known as a 100-year flood area. So when we build a new structure all of them have to be above that 100-year flood plain.”\nLastly, Ramirez adds the camp’s priority remains about the safety and well being of all campers and staff.\nClick here to subscribe to our KNOP News 2 daily digest and breaking news alerts delivered straight to your email inbox.\nCopyright 2025 KNOP.
