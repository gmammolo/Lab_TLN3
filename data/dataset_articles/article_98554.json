  "text": "Sport\nUCL: Very good – Martin Keown hails five Arsenal players after Bayern Munich win\nFormer Arsenal star, Martin Keown has hailed five Gunners players following their UEFA Champions League 3-1 win against Bayern Munich on Wednesday.\nKeown believes the likes of Martin Zubimendi, Declan Rice, Eberechi Eze, Mikel Merino and Bukayo Saka put in a very good performance against Bayern Munich at the Emirates Stadium.\nGoals from Jurrien Timber, Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli ensured Mikel Arteta’s side defeated the Bundesliga giants.\nSpeaking on TNT Sports, Keown said: “Rice was galloping around that pitch. It was the most complete performance that I have seen this young man play.\n“Zubimendi made it possible. He sits deep in that midfield, he navigates for Arsenal with the ball, and then Rice can get forward.\n“On top of that, you have got Eze pulling strings, different class, Saka, always there.\n“And this guy up top, [Mikel] Merino, he puts a performance in. It was a very good night for Arsenal,” he stated.",
