  "text": "Next Article\nAhmedabad is officially hosting the 2030 Commonwealth Games\nBig news: Ahmedabad just got the green light to host the 2030 Commonwealth Games—only the second time India's held this global event.\nThe announcement was made at the Commonwealth Sport's General Assembly in Glasgow, and it's a huge step that puts Ahmedabad on the map for a possible Olympic bid in 2036.\nNew stadiums, big plans, and test runs\nMost major sports hubs—including Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave and Karai Sports Hub—are already nearing completion as of late 2025, with all expected to be ready by late 2028 or early 2029.\nOld favorites like Narendra Modi Stadium will see action too.\nBefore the main event, October 2029's World Police and Fire Games will double as a test run.\nWhy does this matter?\nExpect around 15-17 sports and athletes from all over showing up—so it's going to be massive.\nBeyond medals, it's India's chance to show off its sports infrastructure and prove it can host world-class events.\nFor young fans and future athletes, this is about more than just games—it signals bigger ambitions for India in global sports.",
