  "text": "By Chris Peterson ,\n2 days ago Nov 26, 2025; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Players celebrates with Michigan Wolverines head coach Dusty May after defeating the Gonzaga Bulldogs in the 2025 Players Era Festival championship game at MGM Grand Garden Arena. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images | Kirby Lee-Imagn Images It's not often that you see Gonzaga give up on a college basketball game about 20 minutes in, but just like the Auburn Tigers before them, Michigan basketball beat the Zags into submission.\nAfter three games in Las Vegas at the Players Era Festival, contests that Michigan won by an average of 36.6 points, there's no doubt what this Michigan team can do.\nHowever, the way the Wolverines rose from 14th to No. 1 in the Kenpom rankings, after consecutive blowouts of ranked teams, one that was in the Final Four last season, and another in Gonzaga, that could be there in early April, left the college basketball world stunned.\n\"I’ve been covering college basketball for 20-plus years and have never, ever seen a team absolutely dominate 3 teams in 3 consecutive days like this. This is absolutely incredible,\" Field of 68 Founder Jeff Goodman said.\n\"The National title dream is alive in Ann Arbor,\" NBC's John Fanta wrote on X. \"Holy Dusty May. Holy Michigan. Teams just don’t do this to Mark Few and Gonzaga. As dominant a Feast Week that we’ve seen from anybody - ever. Wolverines just flexed the last three nights. They have everything you want on the roster.\"\nMichigan fan Scott Bell was simply looking to alert the authorities.\n\"I feel like I should be calling the authorities or something when I'm watching this. This has been a three-day, fully televised murder spree. How is this legal?\"\nIt's hard to find the words to describe Michigan's dominance. The Wolverines scored over 100 points in back-to-back games against ranked teams, while holding Auburn to 35 percent shooting from the field and Gonzaga to 34.\nThis wasn't a fluke. It certainly wasn't luck. The Wolverines made 27 3-pointers over the past two nights. U-M had 29 assists on 36 field goals. You simply can't play better than that. Michigan made one of the best 2-point teams in the country, below average.\nDefense is what will give this team a chance to win a national championship, yet in four games in which the Wolverines have made double-digit 3-pointers, they are averaging 105 points.\nTaking in the full picture, it's easy to see why Michigan basketball fans have left analysts speechless.\nThis article was originally published on gbmwolverine.com as Michigan's dominance has college basketball world in awe .\n7",
