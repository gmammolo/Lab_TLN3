  "text": "On his Served with Andy Roddick podcast, the former world No. 1 reflected on Coco Gauff’s triumph at the French Open, where she defeated Aryna Sabalenka after dropping the first set. Roddick emphasized that Gauff’s ability to fight through adversity is what sets her apart from other players at the top of the sport.\n“To be dealing with two shots like that and then to take a kind of gross day and somehow being able to manipulate this match into a street fight, a battle of wills where it’s not just Sabalenka’s dominance on both sides, and she’s done it in both of the Slam finals she’s won, right?” — Andy Roddick\nTurning Perceived Negatives into Strengths\nRoddick acknowledged that Gauff’s serve and forehand are often criticized as weaker aspects of her game. Yet, he argued that her reliance on athleticism, determination, and adaptability transforms these supposed flaws into assets. By refusing to give up, she forces opponents into uncomfortable battles, often shifting momentum in her favor.\n“We always view it as a negative. It is amazing what her base offering, even while trying to negotiate around certain parts of her game that aren’t working, twice. She’s won Grand Slams and beaten Sabalenka in the final. Like, there is a skill to making a match gross, ugly, however you want to define it, and there is a certain beauty in the ugliness.” — Andy Roddick\nGauff’s Record Against Sabalenka\nThe French Open victory was not the first time Gauff had rallied from behind against Sabalenka. She also came back from a set down to defeat the Belarusian in the 2023 US Open final, securing her maiden Grand Slam title. These wins highlight her ability to thrive under pressure and showcase the competitive spirit that Roddick admires.\nThe Broader Impact\nRoddick’s comments underline how Gauff’s career challenges conventional ideas of what makes a player dominant. Instead of relying solely on technical perfection, she leverages her athleticism, mental toughness, and willingness to embrace difficult matches. This approach not only earns her victories but also inspires fans who value grit and resilience in sport.\nCori Gauff in 2025\nRanked no.3, Coco played her last match on the 6th of November when she was overcome by world no.6 Jessica Pegula 6-3 6-7(4) 6-2 in the round robin in Riyadh (draw).\nThis year the American has an overall 48-16 win-loss record. Gauff conquered 3 titles in 2025 in Australia, French Open and Wuhan. The American got to the final in Madrid and Rome.",
