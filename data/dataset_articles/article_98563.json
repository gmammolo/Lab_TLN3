  "text": "William Nylander knows how to call game.\nHe's officially done it better in sudden-death overtime than any player in Toronto Maple Leafs history.\nOn Wednesday night, Nylander skated across the face of goal and slotted a forehand shot into the back of the net for the win.\nIt's the 15th game-winning OT goal he has notched in his career.\nAccording to Sportsnet , that sets a new Maple Leafs record.\nMORE: Shedeur Sanders given Barack Obama-level praise by NBA champion\nNylander breaks a tie with Mats Sundin and Auston Matthews, who each have 14 on the board.\nMatthews, of course, could still catch up to Nylander and even pass him, given that they're contemporaries.\nSundin did his overtime goal scoring in the five-on-five OT era, which was pointed out by a number of people in the comments.\nConceptually, it's easier now to get overtime goals in the three-on-three open style of play that exists in the NHL's modern OT format.\nSo shoutout to Sundin for doing it in the grittier old overtime setup.\nMORE: LeBron passes Michael in a stat that means nothing in the GOAT debate\nBut regardless of setup, Nylander now stands alone in one way.\nWhen the Maple Leafs go to overtime, it's Nylander, more than anyone else, who has sent them home happy.\nMore news:",
