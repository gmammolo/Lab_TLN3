  "text": "Brandon Ingram came through for the Toronto Raptors during Wednesday’s NBA Cup home clash against the Indiana Pacers, hitting his first game-winner for the league’s lone Canadian team.\nAfterward, the star wing unleashed an emphatic NSFW reaction to his late-game heroics, prompting a “cleaner” postgame recap.\nBrandon Ingram Offers Family-Friendly Rendition of NSFW Reaction to 1st Raptors Game-Winner\nFollowing a back‑and‑forth battle in which both teams squandered double‑digit leads, the contest was knotted at 95-95 in the final seconds when Raptors center Jakob Poeltl denied Pacers star Pascal Siakam’s go‑ahead layup attempt.\nThat set the stage for Ingram to dribble out the clock and sink a pull-up 15-foot midrange jumper over Siakam, giving Toronto a 97-95 lead with 0.6 seconds remaining. The one-time All-Star then let his emotions spill out, demonstratively celebrating with his teammates and making his leadership presence felt on his surging squad.\nINGRAM ISO FOR THE WIN 🤯\nBRANDON INGRAM GAME-WINNER FOR THE RAPTORS 💰\n[pic.twitter.com/31icZfCg3U]— NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA)\n[November 27, 2025]\nAfter Pacers shooting guard Bennedict Mathurin missed the mark on his buzzer-beating 3-point attempt on the other end, the Raptors (14-5) prevailed for their ninth straight win. They also remained undefeated in NBA Cup action (4-0), clinching a top-two seed and home-court advantage in the in-season tournament’s quarterfinals.\nFollowing his game-high 26-point, eight-rebound showing, Ingram humorously recounted his reaction to his game-winner, minus the expletives.\n“I said, ‘That’s Why I’m Here.’ That’s the cleanest I can say,” Ingram said with a laugh.\nBrandon Ingram on the *clean* version of what he said after the game winner:\n“I said, ‘That’s Why I’m Here.’ That’s the cleanest I can say.”\n[https://t.co/wO4dcGz0r8][pic.twitter.com/tjk00S6Fm6]— Omer Osman (@OmerOsman200)\n[November 27, 2025]\nAcquired from the New Orleans Pelicans at last year’s trade deadline, Ingram is in his first official season with the Raptors after missing the final three quarters of last season with a nagging ankle injury. Through 19 outings, the 28-year-old has been a seamless fit up North, settling into a primary scoring role on a team that was in desperate need of a reliable closer.\nWednesday’s game-winner marked Ingram’s fourth career go-ahead bucket in the last three seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime. According to the 2016 No. 2 pick, he was [being extra “aggressive and getting to [his] spots”](https://x.com/StarSports/status/1993887893140722131) with Siakam guarding him late with five fouls.\nInitially projected to be a mid-to-low-tier team out East, Toronto (14-5) sits second in the conference, one and a half games behind the first-seeded Detroit Pistons (15-3). Ingram and Co. will look to extend their improbable winning streak to 10 games during Saturday’s road matchup against the reeling Charlotte Hornets (4-14).",
