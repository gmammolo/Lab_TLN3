  "text": "Orlando Pirates picked up their eighth win of the season to go level with Sundowns at the top of the PSL standings. Late goals from Evidence Makgopa and Oswin Appollis ensured a dominant performance got the reward it deserved. The Buccaneers are still second on the table, behind Sundowns, with the Brazilians enjoying a marginally better goal difference (+2). But with a game in hand, which they will play this coming weekend, Abdeslam Ouaddou and his charges willbe happy with how things currently stand. By The Numbers is a statistical review of a selected midweek game.\nA season on track\nJust three months ago, on 19 August, Pirates were in the relegation zone, having lost both their opening league games of the season. As questionable as their form was in the opening stages of the campaign, the situation felt worse given that their very successful Spanish coach had recently left the club. There was a general unease about how things would unfold in the new era, but Abdeslam Ouaddou has navigated those treacherous waters with expertise. Their consistency has seen them pick up points at championship rate.\n8 – wins for Pirates this season, more than any other team.\n1 – matches in which they have failed to score all season, the best scoring record of all teams.\n25 – points from the last 27, Pirates best ever points tally across a 9-game streak\nHow they dismantled Chippa United\nFixtures don’t come as one-sided as this. Across all competitions, Pirates have lost just one of the last 22 games against Chippa (W18 D2 L1). In the league, Pirates have won 19 games against Chippa since the latter became a top-flight club, more than they have against any other team. Yet, Pirates struggled to break them down on Tuesday evening.\n74 – minutes it took Pirates to score their opener, the 2nd latest Pirates opener in this fixture\n86 – minutes it took Pirates to score the opener in December 2020\nYet, when the goal(s) finally came, few would argue that they were not deserved.\n25 – shots for Pirates in this game, their most in a game this season\n4 – years since Pirates had 25+ shots in a home game (November 2021)\n2.1 = xG for Pirates in this game\n87% – win probability for Pirates in this game – based on shot value extrapolations and match simulations (2% for Chippa)\nHome dominance\nMuch of Pirates’ rise up the table has a lot to do with their incredible home form. Not only have they won nine in arow at home, they have also kept a clean sheet in eight of those games.\n9 – home wins in a row for Pirates, a first in their PSL history\n1 – team to have beaten Pirates at home this year (Sekhukhune did it twice)\nOverall home record this season: P25 W18 D5 L2\nWith two games before year end, Pirates have a good chance to lead the table at Christmas. This is something that has not happened in 21 years.",
