  "text": "The Ghana Rugby Football Union (GRFU) brought energy and visibility to the first-ever UK/Ghana Sports Day held at the Accra Sports Stadium on Tuesday, 25 November 2025.\nThe Ghana Rugby Football Union (GRFU) brought energy and visibility to the first-ever UK/Ghana Sports Day held at the Accra Sports Stadium on Tuesday, 25 November 2025.\nThe joint Ghana–UK initiative showcased more than twenty sporting disciplines and attracted hundreds of spectators, athletes, and officials—offering a rare opportunity to witness a wide spectrum of Ghana’s sporting talent on one platform.\nFor the GRFU, the event represented not only participation but also a significant step toward expanding visibility, strengthening collaboration, and renewing momentum for the sport’s development nationwide.\nGhana Rugby fielded five teams—two women’s sides and three men’s teams—demonstrating the sport’s depth and growing national interest. The women opened with two spirited exhibition matches, earning applause for their discipline and teamwork.\nThe men followed with six competitive games marked by intensity and technical improvement, reflecting the sport’s steady progress in recent years. Medals were awarded to the teams, adding to the celebratory atmosphere.\nA symbolic highlight of the day was the arrival of His Royal Highness Prince Edward, The Duke of Edinburgh. His warm engagements with the players created memorable moments for athletes who rarely receive such high-profile attention.\nHis remarks on the unifying and transformative power of sport resonated strongly.\nGRFU President Ms Rafatu Inusah later presented him with a Ghana Rugby jersey, underscoring the Union’s pride and commitment to deepening international sporting ties.\nThe event also drew strong national and continental support. Rugby Africa President Herbert Mensah attended part of the men’s games, affirming the GRFU’s growing presence within the African rugby community.\nSenior government officials—including Youth and Sports Minister Kofi Adams and National Sports Authority Director-General Yaw Ampofo Ankrah—were present, alongside representatives from the UK High Commission and the Ministry of Sports and Recreation, signalling robust institutional backing for the occasion.",
