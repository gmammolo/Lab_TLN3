  "text": "By Tristan Thomas ,\n1 hours ago\nCHAMPAIGN, Ill. (WCIA) — Illinois women’s basketball found themselves in a closer game than you might’ve expected with a 27-23 lead at halftime against Western Kentucky.\nBefore the end of the second quarter, a pair of three pointers by Villanova transfer Maddie Webber helped the Illini build some momentum that they used to pull away to a 70-41 lead in the second half.\nThis is the second straight game that Webber has scored double figures off the bench after she scored 13 in the 86-63 win at Florida State.\nAgainst the Hilltoppers, she scored 16 points in the win at home, going 6-of-9 from the field and 4-of-6 from three.\n“Coming off [the bench] as a spark, like I’ve learned that’s my role on the team and that’s something I’m going to embrace,” Webber said. “I enjoy it a lot, especially because my teammates count on me a lot and they trust me, and I trust them.”\n“Her defense, her offense, I think she’s taken good shots,” Head coach Shauna Green said. “She’s understanding what shots to take when, she only shot nine times, she’s very efficient.” “Last two games is what I knew Maddie could do, and we’re going to need her to continue to play like that.”\nNext up for the 5-1 Illini is another home game against Le Moyne on Sunday, November 30 at 2:00 p.m.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
