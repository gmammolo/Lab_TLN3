  "text": "Thanksgiving football always feels familiar, from the long afternoon matchups to the kitchen excitement in the background . Yet this year's slate feels different. The NFL has decided that the holiday should carry the presence of someone who made Thanksgiving games what they are for millions of fans : John Madden .\nMadden's energy shaped the way Americans watched the holiday. His booming commentary , his love for the classic turducken and the way he made simple plays sound like epic moments turned Thanksgiving into a football tradition with personality.\nPatrick Mahomes steps into his childhood dream as he finally plays on Thanksgiving He passed away in December 2021 , but his style and humor remain tightly woven into NFL culture .\nNow the league wants to bring that spirit right back to center stage. With Packers at Lions , Chiefs at Cowboys and Bengals at Ravens lined up, this year's holiday games will feel like an extended tribute to the coach and broadcaster who helped define them.\nA holiday built around Madden's legacy The NFL is rolling out multiple nods to Madden that go beyond a simple pregame video. Every player across all six teams will wear a John Madden jersey patch. Even the coin toss has been redesigned with his silhouette on one side and a six-legged turducken on the other. Pro Football Talk confirmed the details and noted how closely the league wants to tie the holiday to his legacy .\nThe celebration continues with the John Madden Trophy , which will be awarded to each game's MVP . In a move that mirrors broader league initiatives highlighted in the NFL Foundation's community reports , the MVP will also choose a high school or youth program to receive a $10,000 donation in their name.\nA Thanksgiving broadcast fit for a legend The final matchup of the day, Bengals vs. Ravens , adds an extra layer. Peacock will feature an EA Sports Madden NFL Cast , a special broadcast that uses a video game style camera angle behind the quarterback. It resembles the alternative broadcast trend praised by Sports Illustrated for bringing younger viewers back to live sports, although this version feels tailor-made for Madden's legacy .\nThe league will also auction items from all three games to support the John Madden Foundation , continuing the focus on youth development in his hometown of Oakland .\nThanksgiving football is already one of the most-watched days on the sports calendar. This year, the NFL is making sure it also becomes a day to remember the man who helped turn it into a holiday tradition.",
