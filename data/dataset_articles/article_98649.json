  "text": "Ilya Protas is on an absolute heater for the Hershey Bears.\nWednesday, the 19-year-old centerman scored in his sixth straight game — a 6-3 loss to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins at Giant Center.\nProtas buried a shorthanded goal 2:30 into the third period, narrowing the Penguins’ lead to 3-2.\nThe 6-foot-6 Protas started the play while using his long stick to force a bad pass by Valtteri Puustinen as the Penguins forward looked to break out of the Penguins’ zone. Bears forward Brett Leason then gathered in the turnover, skating the puck in on a two-on-one. He dished to Protas, who deked before depositing the puck past Penguins goaltender Joel Blomqvist on his backhand.\nDuring the six-game goal and point streak, Protas has 11 points (5g, 6a). The rookie pivot continues to lead the team with 16 points (8g, 8a) in 17 games.\nIlya Protas’s 6-game goal streak\n| Game | Date | Goals | Assists | Points |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| HER @ SYR | Nov. 14 | 1 | 1 | 2 |\n| HER @ LV | Nov. 15 | 1 | 1 | 2 |\n| LV @ HER | Nov. 16 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n| HER @ CLE | Nov. 20 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n| HER @ CLE | Nov. 22 | 1 | 2 | 3 |\n| WBS @ HER | Nov. 22 | 1 | 0 | 1 |",
