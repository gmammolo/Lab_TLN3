  "text": "Alabama Task Force 1 deploys from Mobile to Texas to aid in flood recovery\nALTF1 headed to Texas Thursday afternoon.\nMOBILE, Ala. (WALA) - The AL-TF1 team has been activated and deployed around 4 p.m. from the Western Administrative Complex this afternoon.\nGovernor Kay Ivey announced Alabama is assisting Texas in their search and rescue mission following the devastating flooding. The 40-person team being deployed includes Alabama Task Force 1 out of Mobile, Tuscaloosa Fire and Saraland Fire.\n“Search and rescue remains the goal, and Alabama is going to do all we can to lend a helping hand to Texas,” said Governor Ivey in a press release. “We are heartbroken in Alabama to have lost two of our own. I pray for Sarah Marsh’s family as they navigate the unimaginable loss of their precious daughter. My prayers are also with the Santanas as they grieve the loss of Camille and are still searching for three members of their family. Truly, we are all grieving alongside these Alabamians, as well as those in Texas and across our country.”\nImmediately following the tragedy, Governor Ivey aligned state resources so that the state could quickly act, upon Texas’ call.\nThe team is capable of conducting search and rescue response efforts for all hazards, including locating, accessing, medically stabilizing and extricating survivors from impacted structures and areas. Specialized operational personnel include rescue, canine search, medical, hazmat, technical search and communications.\n“This means a lot to us. We’re here to serve whether it’s our local community or areas like this to respond to those who have been affected,” said Andrew Edwards, Search Team Manager for ALTF1.\nCopyright 2025 WALA.
