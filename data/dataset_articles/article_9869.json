  "text": "MIDLAND, Texas — As flash flooding continues to devastate parts of Central Texas, a local Midland chef is stepping up to provide relief in the best way he knows how through food.\nMichael Olivas, owner and chef of Exquisite Catering in Midland, has partnered with the Full Moon Inn Bed and Breakfast in Fredericksburg, Texas, to feed first responders and volunteers assisting with disaster recovery efforts.\nThe idea began when the inn’s owner, a longtime friend of Olivas, posted a plea for help on Facebook. That message inspired him to take immediate action.\n\"I saw her post and it struck me,\" Olivas said. \"I wanted to help her and ease the stress of cooking, so I decided to go and bring my staff.\"\nSince arriving in Fredericksburg, Olivas has committed to preparing breakfast and dinner for more than 120 people each day. The meals are being offered not only to those staying at the inn but to anyone in the area who needs them.\n\"My calling is to feed people,\" he said. \"And when I can do that, especially in this kind of situation. It's really meaningful to me.\"\nOlivas said he spent $3,000 of his own money on groceries and raised another $4,000 through community support in Midland. He and his team plan to remain in Fredericksburg for six days.\nAs cleanup and search efforts continue in the wake of widespread flooding, Olivas hopes his meals bring a small measure of comfort to those working tirelessly on the front lines.\nClose Ad",
