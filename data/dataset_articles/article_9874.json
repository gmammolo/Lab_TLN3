  "text": "Dozens of workers were pulled to safety Wednesday after an industrial tunnel collapsed in Los Angeles' Wilmington neighborhood, the Los Angeles Fire Department said.\nThe collapse was reported just before 8 p.m. near the intersection of South Figueroa Street and Q Street.\nStream NBC10 Boston news for free, 24/7, wherever you are.\n WATCH HERE\nAs many as 31 tunnel workers were rescued and accounted for following the collapse, according to the officials. Twenty-seven of the 31 workers were being medically evaluated, according to LAFD Chief Ronnie Villanueva.\nChelsea Fernandez received word Wednesday night that her husband was among the trapped workers.\nGet updates on what's happening in Boston to your inbox with our News Headlines newsletter.\n SIGN UP\n\"I thought my husband died,\" Fernandez said. \"I love him, and I'm so glad he's ok. I'm not going to take another day for granted.\"\nWorkers were operating a tunnel boring machine, used to excavate tunnels, when the structure partially collapsed. Fire officials say when the loose dirt fell, it was over 15 feet high.\nThe 7-mile-long tunnel is about 18 feet in diameter and 200 feet underground. Workers had a 3-foot window through which to escape due to debris\n\"It was determined that a structure failure of the tunnel line failed approximately 5 to 6 miles in...\" said Villanueva. \"The workers had to climb through debris. They had to make themselves out through and then rescuers actually came to them to assist them out.\"\nMore than 100 LAFD first responders were assigned to assist. Search and Rescue teams were also activated to help with confined tunnel rescues.\n\"I was so concerned that we were going to find tragedy. Instead, what we found was victory. All of the men that were in that tunnel, rescued,\" said LA Mayor Karen Bass at a press conference late Wednesday.\nWorkers were brought up in groups of eight using a crane at the construction site. Aerial footage from the news helicopter captured workers hugging in relief as they were brought back up to the surface.\nThe tunnel construction is part of the Clear Water Project, an investment meant to help modernize wastewater infrastructure, according to Congresswoman Nanette Barragán. The 7-mile-long tunnel is being constructed about 200 feet underground and is expected to end at Royal Palms Beach in San Pedro.\n\"Cal/OSHA has been notified of the tunnel collapse that occurred in Wilmington and is actively investigating the incident. While the investigation is ongoing, we are unable to share additional details at this time. Please note that Cal/OSHA has up to six months to issue citations if any violations of workplace safety regulations are identified,\" wrote Cal OSHA in a statement to NBC4.",
