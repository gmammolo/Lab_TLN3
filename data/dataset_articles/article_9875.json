  "text": "Woman grateful for Valley City volunteers after deadly tornado\nVALLEY CITY, N.D. (Valley News Live) - For weeks, volunteers in Valley City have been helping homeowners literally pick up the pieces following last month’s tornado.\n“It kind of knocked me out. That’s when I crawled to the basement,” said Homeowner DeDe Hejtmanek as she described the moment the tornado caused glass to break and push her onto the floor the night of June 20th.\n“The crazy thing is when I got up and got my dogs in the one room, I came outside and was like ‘Oh my gosh, it really was a tornado.’”\nThursday morning, dozens of volunteers made their way to Hejtmanek’s, including Valley City Teacher Matt Nielson.\n“Coaches are asking them to come, but no one’s forcing them to come. So just to see how many kids care about our community, that’s more important than anything you’re going to learn in a book.”\nA summer day, some students say, is well spent, including 8th-grader Taylor Spanier: “Instead of lying in bed or sitting at home, being here and helping is worth my time.”\nHailley Grenz, a Senior, agreed: “You can be doing so much more. We could be doing other things right now, but we’re out here and everything, and I’d rather be out here and helping out. Yeah.”\nHejtmanek moved out to the area three years ago and now has to start over.\n“It’s a total loss. It’s destroyed, yeah. Because all of the windows broke out, so the tornado just went through the whole house and everything.”\nPicking up the literal pieces of what was once a well-kept yard,\n“It’s like, where do you even start? Honestly, it’s just so overwhelming. There’s no possible way I could do it myself. It would take me months. So yeah, it’s very helpful. Super helpful. I couldn’t have done it without any of them.\n“It’s wonderful. It makes me want to cry. People really show up when you need them.”\nFor volunteers, it’s her reactions that make them realize the impact they’re making.\n“Everybody that we’ve helped out has been so gracious. It helps all of us feel really good about what we’re doing. I don’t know how many thousands of hours that our school volunteers have put in, but it’s absolutely amazing,” added Nielson.\n“It’s gone. But it’s just a house, you know?” said Hejtmanek.\nHejtmanek shared photos of her yard after volunteers were done for the day on Thursday.\nShe says her animals, including pigs, chickens, cats, and dogs, did make it out of the storm. She’s unsure of what the future holds, including whether she’ll rebuild on the property.\nAs for volunteering, Organizer Josh Johnson says they were able to hit four of the five families hardest hit in the area.\n“That’s a wrap! We were able to help 4 of the 5 families in our community that were hardest hit by the tornado. Super proud of our students, school, and community.”\nRelated Coverage:\nCopyright 2025 KVLY.
