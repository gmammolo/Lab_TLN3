  "text": "A 40-person team from Alabama was deployed Thursday to help with search and rescue efforts in Texas following the devastating flooding.\nAccording to Gov. Kay Ivey, the team includes members of Alabama Task Force 1 out of Mobile, Tuscaloosa Fire, and Saraland Fire. Ivey says this multi-disciplined team is capable of conducting search and rescue response efforts for all hazards, including locating, accessing, medically stabilizing and extricating survivors from impacted structures and areas. Specialized operational personnel include rescue, canine search, medical, hazmat, technical search, and communications.\n“Search and rescue remains the goal, and Alabama is going to do all we can to lend a helping hand to Texas,” said Ivey. “We are heartbroken in Alabama to have lost two of our own. I pray for Sarah Marsh’s family as they navigate the unimaginable loss of their precious daughter. My prayers are also with the Santanas as they grieve the loss of Camille and are still searching for three members of their family. Truly, we are all grieving alongside these Alabamians, as well as those in Texas and across our country.”\nThe governor says she aligned state resources after hearing of the devastation so the state could quickly act upon Texas’ call.\n“I am grateful to all those who are part of the search and rescue mission, and I pray for their safety and for the success of their mission,\" the governor continued. \"Y’all, pray for Texas!”\nThe team, which operates in 12-hour periods for up to 14 days, deployed at 3 p.m.",
