  "text": "Repairs are now complete on a Fortis gas line that was damaged in Comox on July 9.\nFortis told the Record that a third party had damaged the gas main on Comox Avenue near Glacier View Road on July 9. Construction crews are working on the Comox Valley Sewer Conveyance upgrade project in the area.\nFortis Corporate Communications Officer Nicholas Insley provided an update on Wednesday evening, saying that \"when our system is damaged, there are a number of steps that FortisBC takes to restore service safely and as quickly as possible.\n\"Our first job is to make the situation safe and determine the best way to stop the flow of gas due to the damage caused by an external party,\" he said in the update. \"As required to start repairs, we’ll need to shut down the affected section of our system. Once we complete repairs and reactivate the impacted portion of the system, our crews restore service by visiting each affected home or business to turn gas back on at the meter and relight all affected appliances.\"\nThe damage to the gas mine affected about 40 customers, and repairs were complete at around 6 p.m. At the time, Fortis hoped to have service restored by 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday.\nInsley reminded people that if they smell rotten eggs or hear gas escaping to \"stop what you’re doing, go outside and dial 9-1-1 or call FortisBC’s 24-hour emergency line at 1-800-663-9911.\"\nHe also recommended to call BC 1 Call at 1-800-474-6886 before digging to get info about buried gas lines and other utility infrastructure to prevent damage.\n\"We thank residents in the area for their patience as our crews work(ed) to complete the necessary repairs safely and as quickly as possible,\" he said.",
