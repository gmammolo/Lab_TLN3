  "text": "Ruidoso firefighters jumped into action to save lives during flooding\nRUIDOSO, N.M. — The orange X’s bring a little relief.\n“Just kind of moved stuff around, make sure there’s nobody that was hidden or scared at the time,” said Captain Justin Mize of the Ruidoso Fire Department.\nThat ‘X’ means nobody was left behind in the now destroyed Gavilan Mobile Home Park.\n“I think our emergency process helped save a bunch of lives with this flood coming through,” Mize said.\nMize is one of the nine volunteers who jump into flood waters to save people in peril.\n“The longer the week goes the more emotions kick in after what you see,” he said. “So it’s been … it’s been tough.”\nWe asked what it looked like for Mize personally.\n“Woo, well it’s chaotic,” he replied. “It’s really chaotic, you know? You gotta … there’s times when you’re not sure if you’re going to make it (out) when you get in.”\nMize and another firefighter braved the swirling water when the calls for help went out.\n“We got seven out,” he said. “Yeah, two kids and the rest (were) adults. The kids were 7 and nine.\n“They were actually inside of a home and the water had gotten so high that it was pushing them up to the roof. They were touching the roof with their hands. Yeah, they were swimming. Yeah, inside the house.”\nHe swam inside a home as the water ripped it apart.\n“Knocked out walls, blew out windows, so they were just sitting there, screaming for help,” Mize said. “So luckily we got to them before they got swept away.”",
