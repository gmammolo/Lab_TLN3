  "text": "TEXAS ( KFDX/KJTL ) — One Texas automaker and its charitable arm are donating a hefty check to support those in the Central Texas Floods. Texas Ford Dealers joined Ford Philanthropy to donate $1.25 million to support local organizations helping those affected in Central Texas. Ford Building Together is the company’s new initiative to support nonprofits nationwide alongside Ford Philanthropy and dealers. This funding will support the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country and local affiliates of our Building Together partners. This includes Team Rubicon’s Central Texas Response, the American Red Cross Disaster Fund, Habitat for Humanity in Kerr County, and the San Antonio Food Bank. In addition to financial contributions, Ford dealers are loaning vehicles to the American Red Cross and participating in a Feeding America food drive to pack boxes that will help support local families in Texas.
