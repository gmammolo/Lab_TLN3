  "text": "TUSCALOOSA, Ala. ( WBRC ) - The official call came around noon Thursday, and by 3 p.m., the Tuscaloosa Fire Department Rescue and Search Team was on the road headed to Texas to assist in the flood recovery , a 900 plus mile trip straight ahead.\nPacked and ready to go; rescue boats, tons of equipment with Captain Hollis Baughn, the lead man.\nThe captain says they know what’s ahead. They are ready emotionally, spiritually and mentally.\n“Many of our guys that have been here a long time remember what it was like April 27, so you can’t really compare the two disasters but we’ve seen disasters, we’ve seen loss of life before and the heart of us we just want to help,” said Captain Baughn.\nTuscaloosa Fire Chief Mark Delk says there is no doubt the team of 12 is up for the job; a job that promises to include long days, high temperatures, and the test of endurance. This team will be part of a larger group to look for the more than 100 still missing .\n“Today we are able to send highly trained personnel and equipment in a time of need. Mayor Maddox said they came to help us in our time of need. Let’s do what we can to help them,” said fire chief Mark Delk.\nThe men who make up the search and rescue operation will be gone for about 15 days; 15 days worth of Alabama expertise and training in Texas.\nThe tab for this deployment may reach up to $700,000 when you factor in overtime, food, fuel, and housing. City leaders say they intend to seek full reimbursement from the federal government.\nGet news alerts in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store or subscribe to our email newsletter here .\nCopyright 2025 WBRC.
