  "text": "ALABAMA (WHNT) — Alabama Governor Kay Ivey has announced she is deploying a 40-person search and rescue team to help after devastating flooding in Texas.\nAccording to the governor’s office, the team includes Alabama Task Force 1 out of Mobile, Tuscaloosa Fire and Saraland Fire.\n“Search and rescue remains the goal, and Alabama is going to do all we can to lend a helping hand to Texas,” Ivey said. “We are heartbroken in Alabama to have lost two of our own. I pray for Sarah Marsh’s family as they navigate the unimaginable loss of their precious daughter. My prayers are also with the Santanas as they grieve the loss of Camille and are still searching for three members of their family. Truly, we are all grieving alongside these Alabamians, as well as those in Texas and across our country.”\nThe move comes after Ivey previously said she aligned state resources to help whenever Texas officials asked for aid.\nThe governor’s office said the team being sent to Texas is multi-disciplined and capable of conducting search and rescue response efforts for all hazards, including locating, accessing, medically stabilizing, and extricating survivors from impacted structures and areas.\nOfficials said the team deployed at 3 p.m. on Thursday and operations in 12-hour periods for up to 14 days.\nThe post Governor Ivey deploying search and rescue team to Texas appeared first on WHNT .",
