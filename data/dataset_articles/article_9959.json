  "text": "HUNT, Texas (KABB/WOAI) — A family of nine narrowly escaped a terrifying flood that tore through their Hill Country home in the middle of the night.\nTad Deupree recounted the harrowing experience, saying, \"We really thought we were going to die.\"\nDeupree awoke to water pouring through the doors of his mother's home and quickly rushed his family, including two young children and his elderly mother, into the loft area as the river surged into the house.\nIn a desperate bid for survival, Deupree and two others used a lobster trap buoy as a battering ram to punch a hole through the wall.\n\"It took all three of us, and it took about 20 minutes to knock a hole through the thing,\" he said. A neighbor later told them, \"I heard you guys banging on the wall like people who were fighting for their lives because we were.\"\nThe family managed to escape through an 18-inch hole onto the metal roof as lightning flashed around them. Below, the house partially crumbled.\nGina Deupree expressed gratitude for their survival, noting, \"There were nine of us. So it was my husband and myself, our middle daughter, her husband, and the two children, our youngest daughter, her boyfriend, and then my mother-in-law. And the other point is, is that if we hadn't come for the weekend, she'd have been alone.\"\nIn the aftermath, the family has set up a GoFundMe page to help rebuild not only their mother's home but also to assist other families in the community. To contribute, search for the Deupree Family on the platform.",
