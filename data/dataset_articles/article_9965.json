  "text": "Tragedy struck Texas last week as flash flooding struck the central part of the state, including a Christian summer camp, known as Camp Mystic.\nSuch a tragedy is devastating, as the floods have taken the lives of over 100 people, including 15 children. Additionally, the flood took the lives of 27 campers and counselors at Camp Mystic.\nIn the aftermath of this disaster, we must ask, How can the Church be a beacon of hope and aid in the midst of such overwhelming loss? That being said, I would like to provide several points in which the Body of Christ can attend to the tragedy at this time.\n1. Prayer and Comfort\nIn the Scriptures, the Bible says, “grieve with those who grieve” (Romans 12:15). We must pray for the families of those who have died in the flash flooding. If possible, reach out to those grieving if you live in the area. It is easy to ponder why this tragedy could have happened.\nAs Christians, we recognize that we live in a fallen world in which suffering is both present and inevitable. I cannot imagine the pain for the parents of a child who has died in the flood or for a child who has lost a parent. We must pray for them fervently at this time that God the Father would comfort them for “He is close to the brokenhearted” and rescue those who are “crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:8). Lord knows the pain we’ve been through ourselves, including losing a loved one, so let us comfort them in their pain. Time and time again, we’ve come to realize that God comforts us in our pain because He Himself is our comfort. As the apostle Paul told the church in Corinth, 2 Corinthians 1:3–4, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.”\nBecause God is our comfort, we can comfort others with the comfort God has given us. Much comfort is needed following last week’s flash flood, and what better comfort than what our Lord provides. Although comfort is a means, it is not the goal. It is meant to provide hope for the downtrodden that God is still in the midst of the tragedy. As the church, we must pray that those impacted by the floods would either turn to God for salvation or be re-oriented to God if they are already saved.\n2. Love And Service\nThe church must also be of service to all. We must be ready and willing to help out those in need. There’s no doubt that the floods have left destruction in their wake, including destroyed homes, businesses, and infrastructure. Although it is commendable to have Christian and non-Christian humanitarian organizations providing relief efforts, how much more for the churches both locally and abroad! Let us serve beyond the four walls without hesitation. Let our talk be reflected in our walk, for our faith is evidenced by action. We love others out of love for God; thus, we must serve others out of service to God. Jesus talks about the importance of serving those in need in Matthew 25: 31-26, where He discusses that we are to be feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thirsty, welcoming the stranger, clothing the naked, caring for the sick, or visiting those in prison as if we are doing it for Him.\nThis also goes to show that the Lord deeply cares for us, for we are made in His image. Moreover, in Christ, we realize that God has loved us with an everlasting love (Jeremiah 31:3). So let us then, attend to those in need of food, supplies, shelter, and more right now in the Lone Star state— whether it’s through raising funds or purchasing these things themselves. We do it out of love. I mean, don’t we desire the same when we’re suffering?\n3. Preaching the Gospel\nThe best encouragement that the church can provide is through sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ. This is not a suggestion; this is a non-negotiable for the church. As famously said by our Savior, He tells His disciples in Matthew 28:18-20: “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”\nChrist, who has all authority, commissions His disciples to make disciples all around the world. And how do we do that? Through sharing the Gospel. What is the Gospel? The apostle Paul makes this clear: “For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.” (Romans 1:16). Although the tragedies of this world leave people feeling in despair, they are not without hope. Just as we came to understand that “while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8), so we can share this glorious truth with the world, both locally and abroad. The Gospel is not limited to time zones or nations; it is meant to be shared all over the world. We know that God sent His Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for us, bore the wrath of God that was meant for us, and now makes us righteous before God through Christ’s very own righteousness. Now that is good news, as Christ’s righteousness is perfect, for He is perfect, as He lived a perfect life without sin. Additionally, He gives us His Holy Spirit, who “bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, (Romans 8:18).\nTherefore, we must spread this Gospel throughout the world, particularly right now in those in the Lone Star State. As time goes on, let us realize the importance of sharing the Good News, as each day is a day closer to the return of Jesus Christ. To close, let us consider these words from our Savior, which we can apply, “Then he said to his disciples, 'The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest'” (Matthew 9:37-38). Therefore, let us carry out the commission we were given in sharing the Gospel.\n4. Prayer\nHeavenly Father,\nI pray continually for the people who have lost a loved one from the floods in Texas. We pray that your church would be responsive in offering their prayers and comfort, their love through service, and through the preaching of the Gospel. Lord, in this day and age, Your church must preach The Good News now more than ever. Emboldened us to be a light to the world and a beacon of hope to the lost, for we know that salvation belongs to the Lord.\nIn Jesus’ name.\nAmen.\nPhoto Credit: ©GettyImages/EricVryn/Stringer\nMilton Quintanilla is a freelance writer and content creator.
