  "text": "Alamance Rescue Squad answered the call during Tropical Storm Chantal\nEditorial Standards\nEditorial Standards\nSixty-one calls for service — that’s how many water rescues emergency crews responded to in Alamance County Sunday night. One of those agencies is the Alamance County Rescue Squad.\nThe Alamance County Rescue Squad is a volunteer service. They have normal, everyday jobs — but those volunteers courageously answered call after call when Chantal moved through the county Sunday night.\nOn Tuesday, volunteers at the Alamance Rescue Squad were cleaning their gear and preparing for the next emergency.\nIt's not an easy task after the Haw River flooded communities throughout the county Sunday night.\nNathan Prince said, “It's pretty crazy to see. The water in the Haw River came up so quick. It, I mean, it seemed like it was rising by the second.”\nNathan Prince is a six-year veteran of the Rescue Squad. He said calls started coming in around 5 p.m. Sunday night and never seemed to stop.\nPrince said, “Just the heavy rain came in. Calls slowly started coming in. Started out with, you know, some vehicles in water with some people in it. We started getting calls where cars were getting washed off of roads, off of bridges. then we started getting calls about houses being flooded in neighborhoods needing to be evacuated.”\nPrince shared the story of one memorable rescue.\n“There was two cars involved. One was still on the road, and the driver of that vehicle said they thought they saw a second vehicle. We ended up going up, looking over the bridge, and we saw a victim hanging on onto a tree. Just. Just by mere luck that we actually saw him there,\" Prince said.\nPrince said there were times when the water was moving so fast that even rescuers couldn’t go in.\n“It's scary. And, you know, it's heartbreaking at the same time because, you know, there's people in need and at that time, you just kind of have to sit and wait,” Prince said.\nEventually, exhaustion set in, but they had to fight through. And with the threat of severe weather every night this week, there’s certainly no rest for the weary.\nPrince said, “We're here. We're ready. You know, if that call comes out, we're ready to go.”",
