  "text": "KERR COUNTY, Texas — Days after the deadly July 4th flooding in Kerr County, neighbors who clung onto a pillar for hours reunited for the first time.\nKevin Jones, a retired Marine Corps sergeant, had a plan and backup plans as soon as he saw water coming up the parking lot.\n“We were up at 4:30,” he said, standing by his apartment, across the street from the Ingram dam. “By 4:45, [the water] was flowing in the door.”\nThe pressure of the water was so strong that Jones and his fiancée couldn’t open their doors to escape. Instead, they smashed the window and climbed out, grabbing onto a pillar to stay above the torrent.\n“This was our pole right here,” he said, pointing. He said they climbed higher on the pillar as the water and waves rose.\nHis neighbors were also hanging on a pillar as several feet of water surged, sweeping away appliances, trees, vehicles and chunks of debris. At one point, Jones said he saw propane tanks explode nearby.\nThe flooding destroyed Jones’ apartment, but he’s salvaging what little he can. Among the most treasured items he recovered were two photos of him and his daughter, some sports memorabilia, and his Marine Corps flag, which remarkably remained flying on a pillar through the storm.\n“It’s horrible,” he said.\nEven as Jones grieves the loss of his home, he realizes his neighbors and people in nearby communities have lost more, with the death toll continuing to rise in Kerr County.",
