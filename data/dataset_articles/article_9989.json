  "text": "Going downhill can actually be tougher than the climb — especially when at the mercy of Mother Nature's whims.\nClimbers were seen struggling against the currents after a flash flood struck Sabah's Mount Kinabalu on Thursday (July 10) morning, according to a Facebook post by the mountain's booking and information centre later that day.\n\"Heavy rain hit Mount Kinabalu this morning, creating strong streams along the trail,\" the video post stated.\nIn the video footage taken by guides, rapid waters were seen rushing down the mountainside, crashing against the rocky surface of the mountain as climbers attempted to descend Malaysia's highest peak.\nMany were seen clinging on to a safety rope as they gingerly made their way down the mountain, all while the flash flood threatened to sweep them off their feet.\n\"If you ever experience weather like this during your climb, stay calm and always follow your guide's instructions,\" the centre also stated in the video, which has since gone viral, amassing over four million views.\nSeparately, Sabah Parks also confirmed in a Facebook post on Thursday that the flash floods started at around 6.15am after heavy rain caused water to surge across KM7 Check Point Sayat-Sayat, a final checkpoint before the peak.\nThe mountain's search and rescue team as well as mountain guides deemed that the area was still safe for descent, utilising the safety ropes to traverse down the mountain.\n\"All 155 climbers successfully crossed the torrential stream at approximately 7.48am,\" Sabah Parks wrote.\nBoth Mount Kinabalu information centre and Sabah Parks stated that the weather conditions were safe prior to the descent.\nThe weather took a turn for the worse around 6.15am, resulting in the flash floods, Sabah Parks explained, adding that they conduct daily monitoring as early as 2am to ensure safe a safe climbing environment.\n\"Park rangers or rescue personnel will inform climbers of the closure of summit climbs should the weather remain unsafe,\" Sabah Parks stated.\nThey added: \"We advise climbers not to panic if they encounter similar situations. Climbers should always follow instructions from rescue personnel and mountain guides for everyone's safety.\"\n[[nid:718107]]\nkhooyihang@asiaone.com",
